EXO's newest demo combines two of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/nvidias-dgx-spark-ai-mini-pc-goes-up-for-sale-october-15-1-petaflop-developer-platform-was-originally-slated-for-may\" target=\"_blank\">NVIDIA's DGX Spark systems</a> with Apple's M3 Ultra–powered Mac Studio to make use of the disparate strengths of each machine: Spark has more raw compute muscle, while the Mac Studio can move data around much faster. EXO 1.0, currently in early access, blends the two into a single inference pipeline, and it <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://blog.exolabs.net/nvidia-dgx-spark/\" target=\"_blank\">apparently works shockingly well</a>.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1536px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:88.93%;\"><img id=\"NyEnaeZBerJ22jadniX2UG\" name=\"exo-labs-dual-dgx-mac-studio-inference\" alt=\"Two NVIDIA DGX Spark systems linked up with a Mac Studio using 10-Gigabit Ethernet for disaggregated AI inference.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NyEnaeZBerJ22jadniX2UG.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1366\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Two NVIDIA DGX Spark systems linked up with a Mac Studio using 10-Gigabit Ethernet for disaggregated AI inference. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: EXO Labs)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To understand how, you need to know that LLM inference has two distinct phases: first, the prefill stage, when the model reads and processes the user's prompt. This part is compute-bound, meaning it benefits from powerful GPUs like the Blackwell part in the DGX Spark. The decode phase follows, generating tokens one by one. That step is heavily bandwidth-bound, making the M3 Ultra's super-wide memory bus ideal. EXO's trick is to divide those phases between machines, streaming the model's internal data (called the KV cache) layer by layer so the two systems can work simultaneously instead of waiting on each other.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:800px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:42.13%;\"><img id=\"4UkkNbcqDrNH5oneT8vcDM\" name=\"exo-labs-llama-31-8b-benchmarks\" alt=\"A screenshot of the EXO Labs website showing benchmark results.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4UkkNbcqDrNH5oneT8vcDM.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"337\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">The performance results from <a href=\"https://blog.exolabs.net/nvidia-dgx-spark/\" target=\"_blank\">EXO Labs' blog post</a>. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: EXO Labs)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In EXO's benchmark with Meta's Llama-3.1 8B model, the hybrid setup achieved nearly a threefold speedup over the Mac Studio alone — matching the DGX Spark's prefill speed while keeping the M3 Ultra's quick generation time. The result is a 2.8× overall gain, and that was with an 8K-token prompt on a relatively modest 8B model.

The series has never really had a golden egg, so to speak, because even Battlefield 1 — the title that put it back on the map — was more of a rediscovery rather than something players were actively seeking as an antidote to the COD machine. With Battlefield 2042, EA failed to capitalize on the growing momentum, but everything seems to have lined up miraculously this time.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series - out of the three, PC leads the charts by a long margin, accounting for 56.7% of all sales, helping EA to over $220 million in revenue with 3.5M+ copies sold. PlayStation follows next with 23.7% of the pie, with Xbox coming in last at 19.6%, but keep in mind that there are fewer Xbox Series owners in general, so the sales are still relatively very healthy. Across the board, it seems that everyone is enjoying Battlefield 6, and the daily active users (DAU) figures are further evidence of that.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1456px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"7cUQJFsnGDXnXAKoQTPpRB\" name=\"5382de4e-65bf-4277-ba3f-3cad9a08d302_1920x1080\" alt=\"Battlefield 6 sales stats\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUQJFsnGDXnXAKoQTPpRB.webp\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1456\" height=\"819\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Alinea Analytics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On PC, according to the analytics, 2.3–2.5 million active users have been playing the game daily since launch. By contrast, around 1 million PlayStation users have returned each day, but we don't have numbers for Xbox. The main takeaway here is that gamers seem to be coming back for some more Battlefield 6 on the daily, propping up a shockingly flat DAU curve for a multiplayer game. Around 45% of PC players for BF6 never even touched BF 2042, showing how this game has become a refuge from the burnout of repetitive or uninteresting military shooters.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/more-than-half-of-battlefield-6-sales-are-from-steam-claim-analysts-blockbuster-shooter-sells-6-5m-units-generating-an-estimated-usd350-million-in-revenue</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Battlefield's triumphant return to form has been met with an equally impressive launch record, with the latest title in the series moving over 6.5 million copies at its launch, across PC and console.

The record earnings were driven by booming sales of AI processors and infrastructure — which now command nearly two-thirds of the company's sales — as well as ramp-up of Apple's latest N3P-based processors for smartphones and PCs. The company expects AI drive to continue in the foreseeable future and forecasts further revenue growth in the final quarter of the year.</p><p>TSMC's third quarter revenue topped $33.1 billion (NT$989.92 billion, nearly a trillion Taiwan Dollars), up 40.8% year-over-year and 10.1% quarter-over-quarter. The foundry posted net income of $14.77 billion (NT$452.30 billion), up 39.1% year-on-year, while earnings per share came in at NT$17.44, or US$2.92 per American Depositary Receipt. TSMC's gross margin reached 59.5%, which is an extraordinary result for a foundry that makes chips for others and does not sell them itself. Still, as the company is ramping up its fabs in Japan and the U.S., its gross margin is taking a hit.</p><p>The company's revenue in the recent quarters was primarily driven by skyrocketing sales of AI accelerators and various AI infrastructure processors, such as CPUs, DPUs, and networking components. In the third quarter, TSMC also began to recognize revenue from Apple's latest processors made on its N3P (3rd generation 3nm-class) fabrication process, including A19 and A19 Pro for smartphones and M5-series for desktops, notebooks, and high-end tablets.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3469px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:46.93%;\"><img id=\"iFSC7xY2tf9UMCDcvkW4FK\" name=\"tsmc-q3-2025-revenue-by-platform.png\" alt=\"TSMC\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iFSC7xY2tf9UMCDcvkW4FK.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"3469\" height=\"1628\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: TSMC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, HPC products retained their leadership in terms of TSMC's revenue share and accounted for 57% of the company's total wafer sales. Smartphone processors were distant second with 30%, followed by automotive (5%) and IoT (5%). Interestingly, dollar sales of HPC components did not really grow from last quarter, which highlights strong and stable demand for these processors, whereas smartphone chips were up 19% sequentially, primarily due to the iPhone 17-series ramp.</p><p>Note that TSMC's HPC platform is a broad and somewhat ambiguous category that spans a wide range of chips — from entry-level CPUs for PCs and SoCs for game consoles to top-tier data center CPUs and massive AI accelerators built with advanced packaging technologies.</p><p>In its latest report, the company emphasized that strong demand from AI and HPC customers continued to be one of the main drivers of its sales and indicated that demand from these clients will remain strong going forward.</p><p>\"We expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies,\" said C.C. Wei, chief executive of TSMC, during the company's earnings call with analysts and investors. \"We continue to observe robust AI-related demand throughout 2025, while non-AI end market segment have bottomed out and are seeing a mild recovery.\"</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3609px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:45.11%;\"><img id=\"XB4CFB4zV9bQkDHhhmanPK\" name=\"tsmc-q3-2025-revenue-by-technology.png\" alt=\"TSMC\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XB4CFB4zV9bQkDHhhmanPK.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"3609\" height=\"1628\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: TSMC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of leading-edge nodes, in the third quarter, TSMC's 3nm-class production node contributed 23% of TSMC's total wafer revenue, N5-series technologies accounted for 37%, while N7 processes made up 14%. Altogether, advanced process technologies — defined as 7nm and below — represented 74% of total wafer revenue during the period.</p><p>TSMC does not expect its sales — driven by AI, HPC, and mobile offerings — to slow down in the fourth quarter. The company expects revenue to be between $32.2 billion and $33.4 billion and gross profit margin to be between 59% and 61%.</p><p>\"Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies,\" said Wendell Huang, Senior VP and Chief Financial Officer of TSMC. \"Moving into fourth quarter 2025, we expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies.\"</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-posts-record-quarter-results-as-skyrocketing-ai-and-hpc-demand-drives-two-thirds-of-revenue-company-pulls-in-usd33-1-billion</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ TSMC posted a record $33.1 billion in quarterly revenue driven by surging demand for AI and HPC processors, the ramp of Apple's latest SoCs, and the continued strength of advanced nodes. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">kUScX72PxxWByEMqSvMbp8</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZU4LiEEqJKst2rDMTv64b-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 14:35:30 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZU4LiEEqJKst2rDMTv64b-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[TSMC]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[TSMC]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[TSMC]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZU4LiEEqJKst2rDMTv64b-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ PayPal crypto partner accidentally mints stablecoins worth double the world’s total GDP — Paxos undersells $300 trillion incident as an ‘internal technical error’ ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Even in 2025, some aspects of cryptocurrency seem rather risky, despite assurances that certain coins are fully backed, stable, and secure. A hair-raising case in point hitting the newswires today is provided by PayPal’s crypto partner Paxos, which accidentally minted $300 trillion <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/digital-wallet/manage-money/crypto/pyusd\" target=\"_blank\">PYUSD</a> a few hours ago. This so-called ‘stablecoin’ is said to be “fully backed by US dollar deposits, US treasuries, and similar cash equivalents.” Despite that pledge, there is no way that such a gargantuan sum was backed by anyone or anything, as it is roughly equivalent to “more than double the world’s estimated total GDP,” reports <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/16/paypals-crypto-partner-mints-300-trillion-stablecoins-in-technical-error.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1112px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:65.02%;\"><img id=\"aPbWCf4jcMCSi3DZ4mhqKJ\" name=\"pyusd-app\" alt=\"PayPal crypto partner Paxos fumbles\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPbWCf4jcMCSi3DZ4mhqKJ.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1112\" height=\"723\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: PayPal, Paxos, and some cheeky editing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An official Paxos newsroom release or blog post hasn’t yet been prepared to provide insight into this fat-finger error by the ‘PayPal USD’ crypto issuer.

There is no security breach.

For example, connectors between two boards were sheared off, and some surface mount components were similarly damaged.</p><p>In some images of the PCB that are shared, you will notice details are blurred at the request of the Canada-based underwater imaging specialist and Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera manufacturer. However, SubC’s requested trade secret obfuscation hasn’t stopped internet sleuths asserting that they know exactly what components have been redacted.</p><p>Picking through Manley's Tweet thread replies, the key PCBs in the camera were likely an Inforce 6601 System on Module (SoM) based on the Qualcomm SD820 processor, which comes with 4GB of RAM on board and 64GB of UFS storage. Another component is thought to be the Teensy 4.0 or 3.2, which acted as an MCU. Last but not least, the undamaged SD card is almost certainly a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-Extreme-UHS-I-Memory/dp/B09X7DZM1V\" target=\"_blank\">SanDisk Extreme Pro 512GB</a> ($62.99 at the time of writing), though it was de-branded in the photos.</p><h2 id=\"data-recovery-process-and-results-2\">Data recovery process and results</h2><p>With an undamaged SD card, of course, investigators (and others) were interested in what details of the tragedy may have been captured and stored by this camera system. The first step was to make “an exact binary image of the SD card” so the original could be left untampered.</p><p>Check out Manley’s Tweet thread, containing investigator report screengrabs, to take in the full gamut of back and forth between the data forensics investigator, Canada’s Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB), and SubC. To cut a long technical story short, though, the parties eventually met up at a lab/office in Newfoundland, where a recovered NVRAM chip and SD card image were interfaced with a “surrogate SoM board.” This did the trick, and 12 still and nine videos were recovered!</p><p>Recovered images were at a resolution of 4,056 x 3,040 pixels, implying a pretty common 12.3MP sensor was used by the SubC Rayfin Mk2 Benthic Camera. Videos were at a more standard 3,840 x 2,160 pixels – commonly referred to as 4K Ultra HD (UHD) video.</p><p>Somewhat disappointingly, the images and videos shared in the report were taken in the vicinity of the ROV shop at the Marine Institute, also in Newfoundland. The location was the logistical base for Titanic dive missions. No deep-sea shenanigans around the Titanic wreck were revealed. Manley explains in his Twitter thread that “the camera had been configured to dump data onto an external storage device, so nothing was found from the accident dive.” Nothing particularly pertinent to the tragic accident, that is.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/tragic-oceangate-titan-submersibles-usd62-sandisk-memory-card-found-undamaged-at-wreckage-site-12-stills-and-nine-videos-have-been-recovered-but-none-from-the-fateful-implosion</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Recovery teams working on the Titan submersible have found the vessel's specialist stills and video camera intact. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">wr444eL6tfSmknJeVhHBVn</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VZrMNqAzoRmU66mPr78Hk-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:02:02 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[microSD Cards]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Storage]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Mark Tyson ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VZrMNqAzoRmU66mPr78Hk-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Scott Manley, David Case at the NTSB]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Titan submersible camera and SD card recovered]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Titan submersible camera and SD card recovered]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VZrMNqAzoRmU66mPr78Hk-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Nvidia’s RTX 5070 breaks the $500 barrier — MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X OC available for $499 on Amazon ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Now might be the perfect time to invest in an Nvidia RTX 50-series GPU, especially if you're aiming for strong 1440p gaming performance.

While it can easily handle games at 1080p ultra settings and even 4K with the help of upscaling, 1440p remains its true sweet spot. Ray tracing is not its strongest suit though and most games at 4K require DLSS to maintain smooth frame rates around 60 FPS.</p><p>Looking at the gaming benchmarks, the GPU delivers a notable performance boost over its predecessor, offering 19% faster performance than the RTX 4070 at 1440p, with a wider gap of about 22% at 4K resolution. At its current price, the MSI RTX 5070 Shadow 2X OC should offer great value for gamers looking to upgrade or build a new gaming PC with an efficient 1440p GPU. Given that it’s the first time the RTX 5070 has dipped below $500, this deal is unlikely to last long, so you better hurry.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-rtx-5070-breaks-the-usd500-barrier-msi-rtx-5070-shadow-2x-oc-available-for-usd499-on-amazon</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Nvidia’s RTX 5070 just broke the $500 barrier, offering a sweet spot of performance and efficiency for 1440p gamers. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">VNyowouhadchhHhmi96jz4</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSh9uGEaUbXWXAUqk7cpQV-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:01:16 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[GPUs]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Kunal Khullar) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Kunal Khullar ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSh9uGEaUbXWXAUqk7cpQV-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Future / MSI]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[RTX 5070 deal]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[RTX 5070 deal]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tSh9uGEaUbXWXAUqk7cpQV-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Microsoft wants you to talk to Windows 11 PCs again — Copilot gets 'conversational' input to complement your mouse and keyboard ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Microsoft is pushing to make every Windows 11 PC an AI PC. In new updates, the company is focusing on further integrating AI into Windows 11 apps and experiences (not just chatbots), and making voice as much of an input option as the keyboard and mouse.</p><p>The idea, Microsoft says, is that AI on a PC should be easy and natural to interact with in either text or voice; that it should be able to see your screen and information and help; and that it should be able, with your permission, to \"take action on your behalf.\"</p><p>\"Voice will become the third input mechanism to using your PC,\" Microsoft executive vice president and consumer chief marketing officer Yusf Mehdi said on a call with reporters ahead of the announcement. He mentioned that the idea is for talking to be additive, not replacing keyboards and mice altogether. Mehdi <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://manus.im/\"><u>authored a blog post</u></a> on the new features.</p><p>You will be able to talk to Microsoft's Copilot AI by invoking a \"Hey, Copilot\" wake word, or use the established Win+C shortcut or Copilot button. With your permission, Copilot will be able to see your screen and make suggestions or provide help. (To enable the feature, you'll have to opt in in settings.)</p><p>In example videos, we saw someone talk to Copilot in a music player app, and the AI walked the user through steps to get the best sound quality. In another, someone watched a YouTube video and asked Copilot to identify the microphone the host was using, and then the AI pointed out that Best Buy had it available.</p><p>This feature, among others that Microsoft is announcing today, won't require a Copilot+ PC (with one exception), but will instead work on any system running Windows 11.</p><p>When asked whether people will want to speak to their computers, particularly in offices with other people, Mehdi said that people already have all sorts of talk in these spaces, and that, between office chit chat and using headphones, workers will find ways to learn how to deal with it.</p><p>Microsoft is also making Copilot Vision available anywhere in the world where Copilot is offered. Windows Insiders will soon be able to interact with Copilot Vision using text (previously, you could only talk to it).</p><h2 id=\"windows-insider-experiences-2\">Windows Insider Experiences</h2><p>Microsoft is bringing a handful of new Copilot features to Windows Insider before they go wide, with plenty of opt-in security controls..These include a new feature to build Copilot into the taskbar, called \"Ask Copilot,\" that takes the place of the traditional search bar. Microsoft says this will let you use just one click to jump into chat, search for files, or use Copilot Voice or Vision. This, like many of Microsoft's Copilot features, is opt-in.There's also a new mode called Copilot Actions, which will let Copilot take action on your behalf. An experimental feature will go beyond the web and even let the AI use your local files, including sorting photos and finding information in documents.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"AoVsBz8226TCs9urwiX8ob\" name=\"Copilot Actions Image\" alt=\"Windows 11\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AoVsBz8226TCs9urwiX8ob.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Copilot Actions will let you observe every step it takes, and you can take over at any point. It will launch in Copilot Labs with a narrow set of use cases, and Navjot Virk, corporate vice president of Windows Experiences, said that these will include more complicated tasks as the model is trained. Actions will be turned off by default, and may request additional consent before doing anything deemed important.</p><p>Windows users will also be able to connect Copilot to services, including OneDrive and Outlook, as well as Google services like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. From here, Copilot will be able to see your calendar and other personal data to help you find personalized information like appointments, contact details, and documents.The Copilot Connections will also let you export text from Copilot to Microsoft 365, letting you put results into homework or presentations.</p><p>Lastly, Microsoft is integrating <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://manus.im/\"><u>Manus</u></a>, a general AI agent, into File Explorer. This AI, which is also available through a native app on Windows 11, can use your documents to complete tasks like creating a website, without you needing to code.</p><h2 id=\"copilot-plus-update-2\">Copilot Plus update</h2><p>There's only one AI announcement for Copilot+ computers. The Click-to-Do feature will now be able to add actions from Zoom.

There is no OLED screen or buttons. We just have a dial at the rear of the unit which selects the soldering temperature. Set your temperature, then press and hold the power button to start heating the soldering tip to your desired temperature. The power button is about a third of the way from the hot end of the soldering iron, and the rubberized grip. <br><br>The grip is large and somewhat comfortable to use, despite being nearly an inch thick. But because of the soldering iron's balance, with weight at the back, it feels off-center, and I found myself gripping nearer to the power button. This meant that I was gripping an area with little or no friction, and my hand easily slid around. I quickly learnt to move my grip to the correct position, but there were a few times where I shifted my grip.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1872px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"dZTCHBZ5CTWApkjdkTtxsa\" name=\"des2\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dZTCHBZ5CTWApkjdkTtxsa.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1872\" height=\"1053\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another issue that I noticed was with the grip itself. It does provide a small guard from the hot end of the soldering iron, there is no “real” guard that will stop your fingers sliding off. Sure, there is no guard on the TS101, Pinecil, or <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/fnirsi-hs-01\"><u>Fnirsi HS-01</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/maker-stem/fnirsi-hs-02-review\"><u>HS-02</u></a> soldering irons that I have tested, but they were smaller and had “grippier” grips, or the grip was further back. <br><br>I would’ve preferred to have seen a better guard on the Fanttik T1 Max, but it would ruin the aesthetic. The thickness of the Fanttik T1 Max and uneven weight make it uncomfortable for long soldering sessions. A smaller, lighter soldering iron is much better for those tasks. But for quick projects, the Fanttik T1 Max is fine.</p><p>Just in front of the grip is a ring of LED lights that illuminate where you are soldering. This is an interesting idea, and my <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Mechanical/dp/B0BLMQ8BXB\"><u>HOTO electric screwdriver</u></a> does the same thing, but for both tools, it adds little to the task at hand.</p><p>The power button also provides a basic level of indication, alerting you to low battery levels, charging status, heating up, etc.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2892px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"74kdthZN2nm3UYrwVsSvQb\" name=\"stand\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/74kdthZN2nm3UYrwVsSvQb.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2892\" height=\"1627\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fanttik T1 Max rests in a rather fancy-looking holder. The hot tip points down, and is a couple of centimeters from the base of the holder. The holder can be rotated to bring the iron nearer to your hand, and it can be positioned for left and right-handed persons.</p><p>The base itself hides a compartment for a selection of soldering tips. Press the drawer inwards and it pops out with three spare tips (knife, hooked point, and precision point). This is a really nice touch, and it provides somewhere to keep alternative tips, instead of adding them to my overflowing soldering drawer. I did notice that at certain angles, the base was a little wobbly; it only has three points of contact to the desk; four would’ve been a much better choice. <br><br>The included sponges, in black and yellow, are housed in a circular dish, and a few squirts of distilled water brought my test sponge to life. They work well enough, but I much prefer brass wool to clean the tip.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"rPPU5YqA8FQxoWnSJ7ogWb\" name=\"kit0\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rPPU5YqA8FQxoWnSJ7ogWb.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3075px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.23%;\"><img id=\"XarT868MuXZxbJHhYEE8Yb\" name=\"kit1\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XarT868MuXZxbJHhYEE8Yb.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3075\" height=\"1729\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:4000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:45.00%;\"><img id=\"9hRZRG8M7UHykoX2cjbhTb\" name=\"kit2\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9hRZRG8M7UHykoX2cjbhTb.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"4000\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Also in the kit was a solder sucker, which looks similar to my Engineer-branded model.

This kit uses a Raspberry Pi Pico to emulate an RC2014 Z80 type system running CP/M-80. I have a thing for old computers and soldering, so the two married nicely.</p><p>The kit comprises through-hole and surface-mounted components. Through-hole is no problem for my aging eyes, but surface mount is a challenge for both my eyes and dexterity. Let's see how the Fanttik T1 Max holds up.</p><p>Through-hole parts were a breeze. My choice of leaded solder melted easily at 350 degrees C, and I soon had all of the shorter components on the board. Next up, I had to solder in the micro SD card slot and the Raspberry Pi Pico. I powered down the soldering iron and left it to cool. In 2 minutes and 10 seconds, the tip was cool enough for me to remove and replace with the hooked point. Heating the iron back to 350 C, I tinned and prepared the new tip, then started soldering the surface-mount components. <br><br>I started with the micro SD card slot and, surprisingly, it went perfectly! No bridges or cold joints, just finely soldered connections to the PCB. The Raspberry Pi Pico was a different story. The Pico has castellated edges for surface-mount soldering, and these are sometimes difficult to solder. This was one of those times. With the hooked tip, it was difficult to get heat into the castellated edge and the PCB pad. I managed it, but after a while, I swapped back to the knife-edge tip to give myself a little more thermal mass, but the tip would occasionally get stuck in the solder. This typically means that the tip has lost temperature and needs a moment to heat up. <br><br>This happens with battery-powered soldering irons. The power supply won’t just dump power into the tip until the battery dies. Instead, it regulates the tip temperature, but sometimes what we demand is not what it can constantly provide. For my own peace of mind, I had to check the connections between the castellated edges and the PCB pads. I didn’t want to go to all of this effort for the kit not to work. So I grabbed my trusty UNI-T UT58C multimeter and beeped out (continuity tested) the connections. Some were bad, so I reflowed them and retested. After that, all was good.</p><p>I finished off the rest of the connections, and the kit was built and, yes dear reader, it worked!</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"XpdFwNE2xJ7KKuuprAAfNb\" name=\"beef\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XpdFwNE2xJ7KKuuprAAfNb.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, I wanted to test the Fanttik T1 Max with a larger solder joint. So I dug into my maker box and found some 3mm (AWG 9) thick marine-grade copper wire that I got when a local store closed down. This is the kind of cable used to supply power, so it has multiple strands of pure copper running through it, making it tough to solder. Many makers just use mechanical connections or a really beefy soldering gun. Can the Fanttik T1 Max solder this cable? In a word, “barely.”</p><p>There was just enough power at 350 degrees C to get the wire to accept solder, so I bumped the temp up to 450 C and things went better, but it still took a very long time to even tin the copper. Joining two wires together was frustrating, and I never had enough power to make them stick. I retested with the Fanttik T1 Max connected to a USB-C power source, and the result was the same.</p><p>For precision soldering on circuit boards etc, the Fanttik T1 Max is a good option, but for beefier solder joints, you’ll need a more powerful soldering iron like iFixit’s Smart Soldering Hub.</p><h2 id=\"fanttik-t1-max-user-interface-2\">Fanttik T1 Max User Interface</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1725px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.23%;\"><img id=\"XyExxS64cYvCni4CkXbxoa\" name=\"button\" alt=\"Fanttik T1 Max\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XyExxS64cYvCni4CkXbxoa.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1725\" height=\"970\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I mentioned earlier, the only visual feedback on the Fanttik T1 Max is the power button LED.

That said, the simplicity it affords means that it suits those new to soldering, or for quick and simple soldering projects.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/maker-stem/soldering-irons/fantikk-t1-max-soldering-iron-review</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Fantikk’s T1 Max soldering iron drops the OLED display from smart soldering irons, but it doesn’t drop the ball when it comes to simplicity. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">927EFsv39GMGDoHf34KimF</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XarT868MuXZxbJHhYEE8Yb-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Soldering Irons]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Maker and STEM]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Les Pounder ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XarT868MuXZxbJHhYEE8Yb-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tom&#039;s Hardware]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Fanttik T1 Max]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Fanttik T1 Max]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XarT868MuXZxbJHhYEE8Yb-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Microsoft Surface and data center production to be moved out of China by 2026, claims report — components, parts, and assembly of laptops and servers moving to counter trade war uncertainty ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A new report claims that Microsoft wants to completely move all of its new product manufacturing outside of China, with the production of its Surface product line and data centers aimed to be built exclusively in other countries beginning in 2026. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a><em> </em>reports that the U.S. tech company is doing this to avoid the uncertainty caused by the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-says-it-is-not-afraid-of-a-trade-war-in-response-to-us-100-percent-tariffs-threat\">U.S.-China trade war</a> and Beijing’s ambitions on Taiwan. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is also said to be following suit, with the company shifting its supply chain away from the East Asian country all the way to the component level.</p><p>“The scope is quite wide and covers components, parts, and product assembly for new product introductions of both notebook computers and server products,” a supply chain executive told the publication. “Microsoft hopes all of these can be manufactured outside of China starting from 2026 at the earliest.”</p><p>Redmond began its shift away from China last year, starting with server production, owing to the sensitivity of these products. One source claims that Microsoft wants a maximum of 20% of the supply chain for these items to come from China. It also wants to do the same for its Xbox consoles, but in a more gradual manner.</p><p>“Moving assembly is rather easy, but [shifting production] down to the component level is radical and very challenging, especially with a timeframe like 2026,” said another Microsoft supplier exec. “We need to see how this ambition will be carried out.” Many companies are already <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/local-and-foreign-chip-manufacturers-expand-their-presence-in-vietnam-companies-move-to-southeast-asia-as-tensions-simmer-between-china-and-the-u-s\">moving their assembly lines out of China</a>, especially after President Donald Trump announced high tariffs on Chinese imports. However, it’s going to be significantly more difficult to source components outside of China and/or Chinese companies, especially as they are long-time suppliers of some of these companies.</p><p>Washington and Beijing’s trade war is slowly pushing companies away from China. Although the U.S. primarily intends semiconductor manufacturing to go back within its borders, nations in the Southeast Asia region are also benefiting from the rivalry. Many companies are moving their supply chains to Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia to escape the prohibitive import taxes placed on Chinese goods. Even though these nations also have tariffs placed on their exports, they’re relatively much smaller, plus their relationship with the U.S. is far more stable.</p><a

Dutch Nexperia takeover saga partly driven by CEO misappropriating $200 million to rescue failing private interests, court records show — U.S. diplomatic pressure may also have played a role ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Dutch government's decision to take control of the Chinese-owned Dutch chip manufacturer Nexperia wasn't just to prevent technology from being transferred overseas, but also based on serious financial concerns over the CEO attempting to bail out his other company with Nexperia funds, according to the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://t.co/CqfGrq2Cel\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch newspaper</a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://t.co/CqfGrq2Cel\" target=\"_blank\"> NRC</a>.</p><p>New court records published by the paper allegedly show that Chinese executive and founder of Nexperia's parent company, Wingtech, Zhang Xuezheng, forced Nexperia to place an order with his privately owned chip factory, WingSkySemi in Shanghai, worth over $200 million. That, despite it actually requiring less than $100 million worth for its own production needs.</p><p>The paper claims (<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://x.com/loekalization/status/1978048062409871368\" target=\"_blank\">via @Loekalization/X</a>) that Nexperia executives resisted, but were then frozen out of company accounts. Xuezheng even fired several financial officers and the company's Chief Legal Officer when they complained. As it goes, board members then contacted the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which ultimately stepped in to remove Xuezheng from power and reassert control over the company.</p><p>This complicates the narrative that the Dutch government was trying to resist the loss of specific technologies from the Netherlands and the EU. Adding more to the picture, a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/business/nexperia-netherlands-us-china.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a> report on the ongoing saga alleges that Washington was also involved. According to its report, court documents reveal \"U.S. officials had pressured the Dutch government about the company’s ownership,\" and that one American official allegedly stated \"The fact that the company’s C.E.O. is still the same Chinese owner is problematic.\"</p><p>It may be partly down to all those factors, though it appears the catalyst may have been Xuezheng's private greed. He forced European officials' hands, and then is reported to have requested assistance from Beijing, expanding the political scope of the spat.</p><p>It also falls on the backdrop of ongoing <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/chinas-new-rare-earth-curbs-hit-14nm-and-256-layer-chipmaking\">polarization in the global supply chains</a> of advanced silicon. We've seen the Trump administration <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/trump-strikes-back-at-china-with-a-100-percent-tariff-and-critical-software-ban-major-escalation-retaliates-for-chinas-rare-earth-restrictions\">take a great interest in the access to and sale of advanced AI processing technology</a> like GPUs and CPUs to China. This move may be further action to restrict Chinese access to chips for a range of purposes, too.</p><p>Indeed, as nations around the world look to build out their own domestic supply of chips and<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/china-bans-its-biggest-tech-companies-from-acquiring-nvidia-chips-says-report-beijing-claims-its-homegrown-ai-processors-now-match-h20-and-rtx-pro-6000d\"> access to AI technologies</a> through infrastructure building projects, access to the latest semiconductors (and even some older designs, it appears) has become of strategic, as well as economic, importance. The potential of a future conflict between China and Taiwan (where up to 90% of the world's most advanced semiconductors are produced) and its allies before the end of the decade looms over the entire endeavour, too.</p><p>The <em>New York Times</em> quotes Reva Goujon, a director at research firm Rhodium Group, as saying, “All these governments are very uncomfortable with [interdependent supply chains] and would like to see these assets back in their possession.”</p><p>Even if it's not clear who fired the first salvo in this silicon trade war, China is just as involved.

Finally, the company disclosed that its Prodigy processor has not been taped out and its final specification has not been frozen, suggesting that the unit is years away from mass production. </p><h2 id=\"256-cores-per-chiplet-2\">256 cores per chiplet</h2><p>The biggest news is that Tachyum's Prodigy processor will adopt a multi-chiplet design and each compute chiplet within that system-in-package (SiP) will feature 256 universal cores (up from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tachyum-prodigy-processor-now-has-192-universal-cores\">192 cores</a> earlier this year, and from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tachyum-teases-128-core-cpu-57-ghz-950w-16-ddr5-channels\">128 cores initially</a>). This suggests that the whole SiP will offer significantly more cores to fulfill the company's promise of '3X the performance of the highest-performing x86 processors, and 6X the performance of the highest-performing GPGPU for HPC.' There is a problem with this performance promise, however: the company still has not frozen specification of the CPU and, consequently, has not taped out the chip, so its actual performance remains to be seen. <br><br>\"With the capital raised from this latest funding round, we are able to get complete Prodigy tape-out with the latest innovations and designs to meet ever-changing market demands,\" said Dr. Radoslav Danilak, founder and CEO of Tachyum. <br><br>Tachyum will use the proceeds from its Series C financing round to finance finalizing the tape-out process and schedule. Tachyum intends to disclose 'upgraded specifications and performance' of its processor shortly — it hasn't revealed when, exactly, but we can make an educated guess that it will happen sometime in 2027.</p><h2 id=\"commercial-shipments-will-probably-start-in-2027-2\">Commercial shipments will probably start in 2027</h2><p>Once funding is received (expected within a month), Tachyum can finalize RTL and physical design — assuming it does not add anything to it, run final validation, and tape out the Prodigy chip. Because Prodigy is expected to be made with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/tsmc-to-build-base-dies-for-hbm4-memory-on-its-12nm-and-5nm-nodes\">TSMC's 5nm-class process technology</a>, Tachyum will get the first silicon in 4 – 4.5 months (depending on how complex the design is, and how lucky the company is after sending in the GDSII file to its production partner — as it will take 1 – 1.5 months to write photomasks and then around three months to build the first wafer / wafers). If Tachyum submits its GDSII file to its manufacturer on Nov. 1, 2025, it will get its silicon in Feb. or March 2026. <br><br>After laying their hands on the silicon, Tachyum engineers will bring up and validate the design to ensure that it functions as intended, and then tune firmware. If the chip works as planned, the process will be complete in six to seven months — sometime in Aug. 2026 (at the earliest), or Oct. 2026 if we're being conservative. Once engineering samples meet target specifications, Tachyum can supply them to early customers and partners receive for their evaluation and validation, which might take another 2 - 3 months. If everyone is happy with these samples, Tachyum will likely initiate mass production of its Prodigy in early 2027. <br><br>If everything is fine with production ramp of the Prodigy processor, commercial shipments could begin in mid-2027. This timing aligns with Tachyum's mention of a potential IPO in 2027 — likely planned to coincide with the initial revenue from Prodigy.<br><br>If Tachyum manages to release its <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/tachyum-announces-dollar5000-96-core-prodigy-based-ai-atx-machine\">Prodigy CPUs</a> commercially in 2027, this will be the longest-developed processor in recent times — its development will have taken about 10 years. Prodigy was initially targeted for tape-out in 2019 and launch in 2020, but the schedule slipped repeatedly: first to 2021, then to 2022, 2023, 2024, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/tachyum-builds-the-final-prodigy-fpga-prototype-delays-prodigy-processor-to-2025\">2025</a>, and, now, the company is looking forward to get the first samples of its chip in 2026. But the company is still optimistic about its development despite these setbacks.<br><br>\"We are seeing how the battle for AI supremacy is currently being waged and we are excited to bring to market a disruptive chip that will enable AI models with parameters many orders of magnitude larger than the synapses of the human brain at an affordable price at a fraction of cost of existing solutions,\" said Danilak.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/tachyums-general-purpose-prodigy-chip-delayed-again-now-with-256-cores-per-chiplet-and-a-usd500-million-purchase-order-from-eu-investor</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Tachyum upgrades its Prodigy to 256 cores and announced and fresh funding for its AI and HPC processor, but admitted the chip has not yet been taped out or finalized, so the project remains far from production despite years of delays. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">aCyTeWR3MD8eHpeJ55cZcG</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5f5WeAbrAL7SpQXQgv8XSF-1280-80.png\" type=\"image/png\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[CPUs]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5f5WeAbrAL7SpQXQgv8XSF-1280-80.png\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tachyum]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Tachyum]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Tachyum]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5f5WeAbrAL7SpQXQgv8XSF-1280-80.png\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Mint Mobile launches 5G home internet service — 415 Mbps MINTernet plans start as low as $30 per month for unlimited data ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Several cell providers have hopped on the 5G home internet service bandwagon, with T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon offering service in select areas across the United States. Now, a new player is entering the fray: Mint Mobile. Mint Mobile is a subsidiary of T-Mobile, which is a known quantity in this segment, and its new service is called <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.mintmobile.com/5g-home-internet/\">MINTernet</a>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, MINTernet operates on T-Mobile's nationwide wireless network, offering unlimited 5G service. Now, whenever unlimited data is mentioned in the 5G realm, you should always look at the fine print. In this case, Mint Mobile says that once you consume over 1TB of data within your billing cycle, \"network speeds vary and may be reduced.\" This is similar to the T-Mobile Home Internet policy, where the restriction is implemented after exceeding the 1.2TB threshold.</p><p>Regarding the speeds you can expect, the \"Broadband Facts\" label for MINTernet indicates that typical download speeds will range from 133 to 415 Mbps, while uploads should reach a maximum of around 55 Mbps. As for latency, expect to see 16 to 28 ms in most situations.</p><p>MINTernet costs $40 per month if you opt for the introductory 3-month offer, and this price is contingent upon paying the entire cost upfront ($120). However, if you already have a Mint phone plan (or intend to add one at the time of signup), your monthly cost drops to $30 ($90 upfront).</p><p>A 6-month plan is also offered at $45/month ($270 upfront) or $35/month ($210 upfront) with a phone plan. Finally, there's a 12-month plan that drops back down to $40/month ($480 upfront) or $30/month ($360) with a qualifying phone plan.

The press release, accompanied by a separate M5 announcement, was just published on the company's website, unpacking the new laptop in great detail. It's largely an iterative update, with the new chip nicely slotting in for yesteryear's M4 in an otherwise largely unchanged package.</p><p>There are no design tweaks or exciting features to speak of. The chassis, including the 14-inch Mini LED display, is identical to previous models — just like all the other core features such as ports, speakers, keyboard, trackpad, and even the 12 MP webcam. The battery is once again quoted to last 24 hours in video playback, and you still only get Wi-Fi 6E. However, the SSD is 2x faster compared to last gen, and you can now spec it up to 4 TB, twice as much as previous gen.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.67%;\"><img id=\"hrgj6qSR8UYM7bAdqafP7Z\" name=\"Apple-MacBook-Pro-14-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-251015\" alt=\"Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M5, 2025)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrgj6qSR8UYM7bAdqafP7Z.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2560\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's clear that Apple is entirely focused on what's inside, the latest generation of its homegrown M-series silicon — M5. This swap is what likely enables the memory bandwidth to be upgraded from 120 GB/s on the M4 to now \"over 150 GB/s\" on the M5.</p><p>The SoC package includes a 10-core CPU, a 10-core GPU with \"a Neural Accelerator in each core,\" and a 16-core NPU for on-device AI. The M5 chip is built on TSMC's N3P node and has a faster GPU that can deliver 1.6x more FPS in games, 20% faster multi-core CPU performance, and 1.7x quicker render times in Blender — all versus the M4. Apple even says it's 86x more powerful than Intel-based Macs in AI applications.</p><p>The price for the new 14-inch MacBook Pro remains the same as last year, with the base model <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\" target=\"_blank\">starting at $1,599</a>, offering you a 512 GB SSD and 16 GB of RAM. Keep in mind that, just like M4, the base M5 isn't available on the 16-inch models as they start out with a Pro chip (so, presumably M5 Pro). The device is available to pre-order right away, with general availability beginning next week on October 22.

Aside from that, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/10/apple-unleashes-m5-the-next-big-leap-in-ai-performance-for-apple-silicon/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> says that the base M5 chip now has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, giving the newer processor two extra cores in both the graphics and general compute departments compared to the previous generation's entry-level SoC.</p><p>“M5 ushers in the next big leap in AI performance for Apple silicon. With the introduction of Neural Accelerators in the GPU, M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads,” Apple Senior Vice President of Hardware Technologies Johny Srouji said. “Combined with a big increase in graphics performance, the world’s fastest CPU core, a faster Neural Engine, and even higher unified memory bandwidth, M5 brings far more performance and capabilities to MacBook Pro, iPad Pro, and Apple Vision Pro.”</p><p>Although it still uses 3nm technology from TSMC, the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/apple-rumored-to-kick-off-m5-chip-production-using-tsmc-performance-enhanced-3nm-node\">N3P process node used on the M5</a> (versus N3E on the M4) delivers improved capability through <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-third-generation-3nm-node-on-track-n3p-mass-production-to-begin-later-this-year\">slightly higher transistor density</a>. The company says that it has four times the peak GPU performance when it comes to AI processing over the M4, and that it offers up to 45% better graphics quality, plus third-generation ray tracing capability. There’s also a 30% bump in memory bandwidth, with the speed going from 120GB/sec to 153GB/sec in the M5, and, of course, a 15% improvement in multithreaded performance.</p><p>Apple’s press release mostly focuses on the chip’s better performance in artificial intelligence workloads, but we’re also hopeful that these numbers will translate to a better gaming experience on the Mac. Unfortunately, we don’t know how the chip will perform compared to its competitors from AMD and Nvidia in the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as we haven’t seen benchmarks yet.

The company has long lead times for its advanced tools, so it has plenty of raw materials in stock to support short-term demand from its clients. What happens after the company's reserves deplete is something unclear, though.</p><p>\"We have long lead times, and therefore, also in our supply chain, we make sure that we have the materials in that we that we need for the next couple of months,\" said Roger Dassen, CFO of ASML, in a conversation with <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>Under the new export control rules China imposed last week, companies have to get an export license to ship such rare earth materials as holmium, thulium, or ytterbium, or products based on these materials, from China's Ministry of Commerce. Furthermore, China imposed its export controls beyond its own borders on products containing rare earth materials originating from China if their value content within that product is more than 0.1% starting December 1, 2025.</p><p>This decision of the Chinese government could essentially stop all the supplies of all rare earth materials and products containing them across the world, something that could harm ASML, which uses a number of them inside its DUV and EUV lithography systems, metrology tools, and inspection tools.</p><p>However, Dassen downplayed the possibility of halting production after December 1, saying that the company's supply planning and long production cycles give it enough flexibility to absorb temporary disruptions. Meanwhile, the company now has over a month to buy rare earth materials or components containing them before the new export controls regime is enacted.</p><p>Speaking of China, ASML re-emphasized that it expects demand from its customers in the People's Republic to drop in 2026 due to the revocation of fast-track VEU license exemptions for Micron, Samsung, SK hynix, and TSMC, as well as softening demand from local chipmakers.</p><p>\"When we look at China, we believe that the demand of our Chinese customers is going to be significantly lower in 2026 than it has been in 2024 and 2025 when we had very strong business there,\" said Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, during the company's earnings call with investors and analysts.</p><a

                                                    <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Asset management firm BlackRock has joined forces with Microsoft, Nvidia, and xAI to purchase Aligned Data Centers (Aligned) through an investment consortium called the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251014427963/en/AI-Infrastructure-Partnership-AIP-MGX-and-BlackRocks-Global-Infrastructure-Partners-GIP-to-Acquire-All-Equity-in-Aligned-Data-Centers\" target=\"_blank\">Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure Partnership</a> (AIP). Aligned is one of the largest data center companies in the world, having a total of planned and operational capacity of 5GW spread across 50 campuses. According to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251014427963/en/AI-Infrastructure-Partnership-AIP-MGX-and-BlackRocks-Global-Infrastructure-Partners-GIP-to-Acquire-All-Equity-in-Aligned-Data-Centers\" target=\"_blank\">the company</a>, the data center operator is present globally, including sites in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Ohio, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Sao Paulo (Brazil), Queretaro (Mexico), and Santiago (Chile).</p><p>Aside from AIP, other partners in the deal also included MGX, an AI investment firm owned and funded by the Abu Dhabi government in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), BlackRock subsidiary Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the Kuwait Investment Authority, and Temasek, a state-owned investment company owned by the Singapore Minister for Finance.</p><p>These investments show how state-owned funds are interested in diving into artificial intelligence, either through their own infrastructure, like the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-says-it-will-expand-stargate-ai-infrastructure-project-to-the-uae-starting-with-a-1gw-cluster\">Stargate AI project in the UAE</a>, or through monetary contributions to projects like these. Other companies, like Cisco Systems, GE Vernova, and Next Era Energy, are also part of the partnership as technology and power providers.</p><p>But what’s more interesting is how some of the biggest names in AI joined together to form AIP. BlackRock, GIP, Microsoft, and MGX founded the partnership in September 2024, with Nvidia and xAI joining later. Even though it took more than a year for the group to make its first purchase, it’s a massive one — the deal is expected to cost $40 billion, making it one of the most expensive data center purchases in history.</p><p>This combination of capital and technical expertise would help Aligned stay ahead in the global AI race. “Partnering with the Consortium will accelerate our mission to deliver the infrastructure powering tomorrow’s digital economy,” Aligned Data Centers CEO Andrew Schaap said. “With AIP, MGX, and GIP’s global reach, extensive resources, and deep expertise across AI, energy, and finance, we are poised to scale faster, innovate further, and redefine what’s possible in sustainable data center infrastructure.” AIP expects to complete the deal by the first half of 2026, provided it passes regulatory oversight.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left

And now we can see why SpaceX has started to use its more powerful Starship vehicle, in preference over the existing Falcon 9 rocket, which was used for prior generation satellite deployments..</p><p>As well as their obviously significantly larger physical form, a V3 satellite is estimated to weigh in at as much as 2,000kg (4,409 pounds). Compare that to the existing V2 Mini satellites, which are less than 600kg, and the V1 satellites at around 300kg.</p><p>We’ve established that these V3 Starlink satellites are big and heavy, so what are the network performance gains? SpaceX’s latest social media bulletin regarding the performance of these units is quite brief. However, it highlights that V3 will “bring gigabit connectivity to users and are designed to add 60 Tera-bits-per-second of downlink capacity to the Starlink network.”</p><p>Thankfully, there were some prior news releases and filings, which flesh out V3 details. An important one, for example, is that for every upcoming Starship launch, it will be possible to put 60 V3 satellites into orbit. “That's more than 20 times the capacity added with every V2 Mini launch on Falcon 9,” says SpaceX. Moreover, each new V3 satellite boasts 1,000 Gbps of download and 200 Gbps of upload bandwidth, making them better than 10x faster than V2 models.</p><div class=\"see-more see-more--clipped\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet hawk-ignore\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Starship has successfully deployed our @Starlink simulators pic.twitter.com/muNMalZkbT<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1977884820484272524\">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"see-more__filter\"></div></div><p>With the V3 satellites deploying, probably early next year, we might begin to see SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s original vision of a global broadband service materialize. The new satellites’ next-gen architecture should deliver the increased coverage and speed to iron out connectivity and capacity wrinkles some users are experiencing with the service, as it stands. However, it has previously been indicated that Starlink users will need new hardware to benefit from the best speeds V3 satellites will enable.</p><p>Hopefully, SpaceX is still designing even its latest, biggest, and heaviest satellites to completely <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/networking/concerns-grow-after-spate-of-social-media-posts-showing-spacex-starlink-satellites-burning-in-the-sky-we-are-currently-seeing-a-couple-of-satellite-re-entries-a-day-says-respected-astrophysicist\">burn up upon reentry</a>, at the end of their working lives. With V3, there’s a lot more mass to be combusted on the way down to Earth, and as more satellites head into orbit, space debris — and that debris falling back to earth — remains a growing concern.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/service-providers/network-providers/spacex-shows-off-massive-new-v3-starlink-satellites-expanded-technology-will-deliver-gigabit-internet-to-customers-for-the-first-time-and-enable-60-tera-bits-per-second-downlink-capacity</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Much larger and heavier V3 satellites set to boost Starlink connectivity to gigabit speeds.

It doesn't have Steam Deck levels of polish, but it's a revelation compared to the standard Windows desktop.</p><p>But that Xbox menu hides PC levels of customization and complexity. Me? I loved having my Steam and Epic libraries next to games from my Xbox collection. (Or at least, the ones that support Xbox Play Anywhere.) But to Xbox purists or those who haven't dipped a toe into PC gaming before, I think this might be frustrating, and will raise questions about what an Xbox is and what the future of Xbox looks like.</p><p>All in all, the ROG Xbox Ally X feels far more like an Asus gaming handheld than an Xbox one. But outside of tremendously comfortable ergonomics, it's Microsoft's software engineering that makes the Xbox Ally X one of the best PC gaming handhelds around. That is, at least until Microsoft makes the updated operating system available on all Windows 11-based gaming handhelds.</p><h2 id=\"design-of-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-2\">Design of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><p>The Xbox controller is effectively the default controller in PC gaming (other than a mouse and keyboard). So it's honestly a bit surprising it's taken this long for a major PC company to copy that gamepad's comfortable prongs and adapt them to a gaming handheld. It worked for the PlayStation Portal!</p><p>Otherwise, though, this Ally looks much like the 2024 Ally X that came before it, with an angular design, plenty of ROG branding, and dedicated buttons for Asus' Armory Crate. Other than an Xbox button, which Windows 11 handhelds have desperately needed for a while now, there is nothing that makes this feel like an Xbox based on Microsoft's current console designs (although there is a repeating ROG XBOX pattern in tiny print on the device). If Asus had released this design without calling it an Xbox, I'd be none the wiser. It has a blacked-out color scheme with hints of red on the buttons. I would've liked to see the Xbox-colored buttons on the vanilla ROG Xbox Ally.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"WAQgfSXocDkUahuSCWtVYQ\" name=\"on-table\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WAQgfSXocDkUahuSCWtVYQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"bcMjDp5RD9n7ruzT3gsSUQ\" name=\"rear\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bcMjDp5RD9n7ruzT3gsSUQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The prongs feel great. This is the most natural a handheld has felt in my hand so far since the Steam Deck. These grips do make the system wider than some other systems, however, which makes it a bit bulky for travel. I was surprised at how good the system felt in my hands. It's wide in a way that makes it look like it would be awkward, but the weight is distributed very evenly, and I was comfortable even for long play sessions. It really does feel like you're using a controller.</p><p>Other than that, the general look of the system is almost identical to the ROG Ally X from 2024. You get a very classic Xbox layout here, with ABXY buttons, offset joysticks, and a D-pad sitting on a disk. These are not, however, identical to what you see on an Xbox wireless controller, with all of the Asus ROG styling. I love the rubberized coating around the edges of the joysticks' caps (that reminded me of an Xbox controller), and the buttons are clicky and tactile, if a bit loud. Each joystick is surrounded by a moat of RGB light, which you can customize in Asus's Armoury Crate software. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/handheld-gaming/lenovo-legion-go-2-review\"><u>Lenovo Legion Go 2</u></a>, there's no sign of Hall Effect joysticks here.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"9pHsmcjchsouYW4JNGqBSQ\" name=\"right-controls\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9pHsmcjchsouYW4JNGqBSQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"pDTd4rgNasCMne6HJ6XGSQ\" name=\"left-controls\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDTd4rgNasCMne6HJ6XGSQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are standard bumpers and triggers, though the new Xbox-branded Ally systems use what Xbox calls \"impulse\" triggers with motors for vibration. Asus notes that these are Hall Effect triggers, so at least they're using that tech somewhere! The bumpers feel a bit cheap for my liking, with clicky plastic, and the trigger vibration, though kind of fun in racing titles like the <em>Forza Horizon </em>series, isn't terribly powerful.</p><p>There are just two macro buttons, one on each side of the rear of the device. That's fine for me, but some people may prefer the Legion Go 2's three buttons or the four on the back of the Steam Deck.</p><p>The Xbox button is to the right of the left thumb stick. This is as good a place for it as any, and never got in my way. On the left side of the screen are buttons for Armoury Crate and the View button, while the right side features a button to bring you to your library (or, with a long press, call up Copilot) and the standard Menu button.</p><p>What there isn't is a touchpad. If you want one, you're better off looking at the Steam Deck. I like touchpads, but their absence here is far from a dealbreaker for me, and I didn't really miss them.</p><p>On top of the system, there are two USB Type-C ports: one with USB4 and the other using USB 3.2 Gen 2. The USB4 port is Thunderbolt 4 compatible, and I had no issue plugging it into a Thunderbolt dock to play games on my monitor. There is also a microSD card slot, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, and a fingerprint reader built into the power button. All of the ports are on top.</p><p>Like the previous Ally, there are vents in the back of the system between the macro buttons. That brings cool air in to chill the processor, which is then ejected out of the top of the system.</p><p>The Xbox Ally X weighs 1.58 pounds, which feels substantially lighter than the Lenovo Legion Go 2’s 2.03 pounds. It's a slight bump over the original Ally X (1.49 pounds), while the Steam Deck OLED is lighter than its Windows-based counterparts (1.41 pounds).</p><p>If you include the prongs (and the prongs are permanently attached, so you have to), the Ally X measures 11.42 x 4.76 x 2.00 inches, though it's 1.08 inches deep at its thinnest point. That means that it's technically thicker than the Lenovo Legion Go 2 (11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches), though it doesn't feel as hefty.</p><p>The original Ally X measured 11.02 x 4.37 x 1.45 inches, so this iteration is larger all around, while the Steam Deck OLED is still the widest option at 11.73 x 4.6 x 1.97 inches.</p><p>The system comes with a small cardboard stand in the box. I'd rather it come with a carrying case, like the Steam Deck and Lenovo Legion Go 2. Instead, you have to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-premium-2-in-1-hard-case-for-rog-xbox-ally-black/JJGHGPPPYY\"><u>pay an extra $70</u></a> if you want an official case for this handheld.</p><h2 id=\"asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-specifications-and-components-2\">Asus ROG Xbox Ally X Specifications and Components</h2><p>Asus is using the AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme. This chip is almost identical to the regular Ryzen Z2 Extreme we saw in the Legion Go 2, except that it has a 50 TOPS NPU on board, as well as three Zen 5 cores and five Zen 5c cores. The Z2 Extreme has a max boost clock of 5 GHz on the Zen 5 cores, (3.3 GHz on the Zen 5c cores) and a base clock of 2 GHz. That max boost is actually 0.1 GHz slower than the Z1 Extreme.</p><p>The Z2 Extreme goes up to 35 watts with its configurable <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/tdp-thermal-design-power-definition,5764.html\"><u>TDP</u></a>.

I tried it with Microsoft's Gaming Copilot, but considering it was often wrong and unhelpful about what to do in games, the NPU is more for upcoming features regarding AI-powered upscaling.</p><p>There's a 16-core GPU using integrated Radeon RDNA 3.5 graphics. Asus has opted for 24GB of RAM, the same as in the original Ally X but less than the 32GB in the Legion Go 2.

The CPU and GPU have a shared memory pool, which defaults to 8GB of memory assigned to the GPU in Asus's Armoury Crate SE software. You can customize this, but we ran it at the out of the box settings.</p><p>By default, the system runs in a 25W performance mode while unplugged and a 35W <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/clock-speed-definition,37657.html\"><u>turbo</u></a> mode while plugged in. Again, we stuck to these values in our testing. We ran games at both <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/what-is-hd,5745.html\"><u>720p</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/what-is-fhd-full-hd,5741.html\"><u>1080p</u></a>. In our comparisons, the Legion Go 2 and Steam Deck were tested at 1280 x 800 and 1920 x 1200 to fit their 16:10 screens.</p><p>Using the Xbox Full Screen Experience should free up some memory and provide performance advantages, as it doesn't load some Windows components. We benchmarked games through the FSE, with the exception of our stress test, which requires additional logging software.</p><p>In my spare time with the Xbox Ally X, I played <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em>, mostly on battery power. At 720p and medium settings, the game ran between 75 and 111 FPS in missions, though when exploring the Abbey, it was sometimes closer to 60 FPS.</p><p>I also tried <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which I couldn't run on handhelds with the Z1 Extreme. Here, it worked, albeit with some serious caveats. With the screen at 720p and using a 640 x 360 performance render resolution with FSR2 upscaling, the game ran between 32 and 53 FPS is a nightmare version of New York. Down in the subways, away from the open world level, the game hit the 60 FPS cap I had invoked to save the battery. But the game generally looked terrible and blurry from the low resolution.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1133px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.90%;\"><img id=\"2fehYCGCdSx9pa3L6TXNZf\" name=\"image002\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2fehYCGCdSx9pa3L6TXNZf.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1133\" height=\"758\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1133px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.90%;\"><img id=\"zodMaHFAg5dxnrCfc6Saaf\" name=\"image003\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zodMaHFAg5dxnrCfc6Saaf.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1133\" height=\"758\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1133px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.90%;\"><img id=\"fkxn7yyUN8DPFLiRSbGPZf\" name=\"image004\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkxn7yyUN8DPFLiRSbGPZf.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1133\" height=\"758\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1133px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.90%;\"><img id=\"Ffmcvac9KTXAZqJpHtXHZf\" name=\"image005\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ffmcvac9KTXAZqJpHtXHZf.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1133\" height=\"758\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>On the <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> benchmark (medium settings, DX12), the Xbox Ally X hit 64 FPS at 720p plugged in and 79 FPS unplugged. At 1080, those boosted to 45 and 52 FPS, respectively. Those results are similar to the Legion Go 2, and show a nice but not extraordinary bump over the Asus ROG Ally X.</p><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077's </em>Steam Deck preset showed off the system's power when plugged in, where it hit 63 FPS at 720p and 40 FPS at 1080p. Those both beat the Legion Go 2, though that had the disadvantage of having to push a few more pixels to power its 800p screen.</p><p><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (favor performance, Vulkan), the Xbox Ally X showed off gains at 720p while unplugged, hitting 66 FPS. It scored almost identically to the Legion Go 2, but showed upticks over the original Ally X all around.</p><p><em>Borderlands 3 </em>(medium, DX11) was the only misstep. At 59 FPS at 720p unplugged and 68 FPS plugged in, it came in behind the Legion Go 2 at 800p. 1080p performance, however, was comparable. In fact, at 720p, the Xbox Ally X had effectively no gains over the original Ally X in this game, though 1080p performance was improved.</p><p>Now that we've seen handhelds getting slightly more power, we've  upped our stress test. It's still <em>Metro Exodus</em> running 15 times at 720p to simulate about half an hour of gameplay, but we've moved from low to medium settings. The Xbox Ally X achieved an average frame rate of 63.44 FPS on the benchmark.The consistency across the 15 runs suggests the cooling is adequate for the chip.</p><p>The Xbox Ally X's three Zen 5 cores ran at an average of 3.24 GHz during the stress test, while the Zen 5c cores hit 2.15 GHz.</p><h2 id=\"windows-11-and-armoury-crate-on-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-is-it-an-xbox-2\">Windows 11 and Armoury Crate on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X: Is it an Xbox?</h2><p>The Xbox Full Screen Experience is significantly better for handhelds than standard Windows 11.</p><p>You boot straight into a version of the Xbox app featuring a home screen with recently played games, though like a standard Xbox, the app also advertises game deals, Game Pass, and has curated lists of games.

even bother loading certain components of the OS that aren't used for gaming, making it lighter, saving RAM, and putting more resources toward games. The handheld even came with Steam preinstalled, booting right into big picture mode. That's a nice welcome mat for PC gamers, though I later did end up in the traditional Steam interface upon further boot ups.</p><p>Launchers, however, don't always work well. For instance, if you go into Steam's Big Picture mode, you'll get a great experience with the Xbox controller. But if you end up in Epic Games, as I did after quitting games like <em>Borderlands 3</em> and <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em>, I found myself in an environment where I had to use this PC-style launcher with touch, as there was no mouse control. Even then, when I had the system at 720p, I'd have a gray box around the launcher, making it even harder to hit the touch targets. I had similar issues launching <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> from Steam, which forces you to go through CD Projekt Red's launcher. When you pick a game from the Xbox menu, launchers still have to boot and run in the background, which sometimes leaves you with a minute or so of hangtime. You don't have these problems when playing games from the Xbox Store.</p><p>Games from the Xbox Store also get other bonuses, like nicer artwork and, if you buy from the Xbox Store, analysis of how well the game will play on your PC.</p><p>You can still boot into the desktop (and load all of those extra Windows components upon doing so). If you want to use this system as a standard Windows 11 PC, there's nothing stopping you. It has all of the flaws of other gaming handhelds running Windows, but I'm glad the option is still there. I'm sure there will be at least some people who use the handheld with a keyboard and mouse or just want to tinker.</p><p>There are a number of waypoints in and out of the Full Screen Experience, but they feel bolted on to the Xbox app. But the sheer number of ways to get back into it means most people won't get lost. If you do go to full screen Windows 11, it will load the rest of the OS components, likely affecting gaming performance, so you'll want to restart when switching between the Xbox FSE and Windows (the system encourages you to do so).</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"KzmyzFz9hWXCDdgsKFKzTQ\" name=\"windows\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzmyzFz9hWXCDdgsKFKzTQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And there are still aspects of Windows you can't control. Install a game or launcher that Windows runs through User Account Control? UAC doesn't pop up on an Xbox, but it still happens here. Asus also includes some unnecessary software, like MyAsus and GlideX for screen sharing, which feel out of place on a gaming handheld.</p><p>One of SteamOS's biggest advantages is a rating system that gives you an idea of how well a game works on the Steam Deck. Microsoft is doing something similar in the Xbox FSE, called the Handheld Compatibility program. Games are labeled as \"Handheld Optimized\" with a green checkmark, or \"Mostly compatible\" with a blue icon, suggesting you need to change some settings to get the game to run well. These badges are buried in the Xbox Store, so you won't see equivalents for other launchers. But Microsoft <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/browse/DynamicChannel.HandheldCompatPlayableGamesPCGA\"><u>does keep a list of games it and studio partners have tested for handheld compatibility</u></a>.</p><p>Asus's Armoury Crate SE is still here, both as a full application and as a smaller \"Command Center\" built into the Xbox interface and available through Windows 11. It's important as you switch through performance modes, change wattage to the processor (which can greatly affect battery life), and make other adjustments.

For almost a year, Microsoft has been pushing a campaign that <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/\"><u>anything can be an Xbox</u></a>, from laptops to car entertainment systems to phones – and now, gaming handhelds running Windows.</p><p>If you're coming from using an <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/xbox-series-x\"><u>Xbox Series X</u></a> or Series S, though, this is a fundamentally different experience in many ways. While Xbox Play Anywhere features over 1,000 games and lets you share save states and achievements, it also assumes you bought those games from the Microsoft Store. And plenty of games don't support Play Anywhere, including some of Microsoft's own. (It's nice to see that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> got support after <em>Doom Eternal </em>didn't).</p><p>Microsoft needs to get to a point where all Xbox games are playable anywhere with this support to compete with the user experience Valve offers on Steam Deck. It's tough to call something an Xbox when it doesn't play every Xbox game. That will certainly confuse some people. Xbox gamers will also get their choice of using Game Pass or using Remote Play from their console, so there's a lot of flexibility here.</p><p>But as a PC handheld, this system also supports Steam, Epic Games, and every other launcher under the sun. All of those launchers, and all of the games within them, have far more settings to tinker with than ever before. Add in the fact that Asus' software gets deep into TDP, and this is a system with far more options than any Xbox owner ever had before. Enthusiasts will love that. But I also think there will be a number of console devotees who wonder how the heck this thing is an Xbox. It sure feels a lot more like an Asus gaming PC.</p><p>Microsoft is promising a bunch of upcoming features early next year, but we can only judge the Ally X on what's available today. Promised updates include automatic super resolution to use the AI Z2 Extreme's NPU to upscale games at the system level with no changes needed in game, as well as a game save sync indicator to make sure your save is stored, and improved library management for SD cards, making it easier to store and manage your games from the FSE.</p><p>Even without those, though, the Xbox FSE makes the Xbox Ally X the best PC gaming handheld with Windows because it's so much easier to use, despite the fact that Microsoft clearly has work to do to make launchers less janky and make the whole thing more full-featured. None of this is as polished or as easy as Valve's SteamOS, but it's significantly closer than using the regular Windows 11 UI. I can't wait for Microsoft to let every gamer with a handheld get a better experience than they do on the standard Windows 11 desktop.</p><h2 id=\"display-on-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-2\">Display on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><p>Asus is using a 7-inch, 1920 x 1080, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ips-in-plane-switching-definition,5748.html\"><u>IPS</u></a> touchscreen that runs up 120 Hz on the Xbox Ally X. If that sounds familiar, it's because it's probably the same screen on the previous Ally X. The 16:9 aspect ratio differs from what Valve and Lenovo have done, with taller 16:10 screens that also use OLED technology. In fact, this screen doesn't support <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/what-is-hdr-monitor,36585.html\"><u>HDR</u></a>.</p><p>In general, the screen looks good. In <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em>, the Abbey is filled with colorful characters. Agatha's altar includes many blue flames (and, oh, yeah, Agatha Harkness's blue ghost), which created a haunting effect that contrasted against greenery at night. It doesn't, however, look anywhere near as vivid as the Lenovo Legion Go 2 I just tested.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1204px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.78%;\"><img id=\"4Rabr9UY7EoJ8yL4Fyccaf\" name=\"image001\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Rabr9UY7EoJ8yL4Fyccaf.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1204\" height=\"804\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ROG Xbox Ally X's screen tested almost identically to the ROG Ally X we tested last year. Given they have the same specs, they're almost certainly same panel. The Xbox Ally X's panel covers 110% of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reference/what-is-dci-p3-color-a-basic-definition\"><u>DCI-P3</u></a> color gamut and 77.9% of the more challenging DCI-P3 space by volume. That's easily beaten by the OLED screens on the Legion Go 2 and the Steam Deck OLED.</p><p>At 515.8 nits of brightness, this panel is more luminous than the Legion Go 2, though the Steam Deck OLED took the crown at 597.2 nits.</p><h2 id=\"battery-life-on-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-2\">Battery Life on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><p>Battery life on a handheld, like its competitors, is largely dependent on your settings and the game you play. I tend to play games in a way to try to preserve battery life as long as possible. If you play low-impact games like <em>Stardew Valley</em> or even <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, you may experience longer battery life than the effects-heavy games I tested.</p><p>One evening when testing the Xbox Ally X, I played some <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns </em>with the system in Performance mode. At medium settings at 720p with the screen locked to 60 Hz and 50% brightness, the battery had dropped to 50% after an hour and 32 minutes.</p><p>When I played <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, I kept the same 17W Performance mode, 50% brightness, and 60 Hz refresh rate. At 720p using FSR2 upscaling on a performance-focused 640 x 360 render resolution and low settings preset without <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/ray-tracing-definition,37600.html\"><u>ray tracing</u></a>, the handheld hit 50% in an hour and 35 minutes.</p><p>If you extrapolate from these, those suggest about 3 hours on battery, and that's with the limitations I put in place. That seems about standard when compared with the Legion Go 2.</p><h2 id=\"audio-on-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-2\">Audio on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><p>The twin speakers on the Xbox Ally X are front facing, playing the sound right toward you. This is the optimal location, similar to what you find on the Steam Deck OLED. Some other handhelds have the speakers facing out of the top, away from you.</p><p>I used some of my time with the ROG Xbox Ally X to play a bit of <em>Tetris Effect</em>, which I had through Xbox Play Anywhere. The game sounds best with headphones, but the speakers did a solid job. The \"Prayer Circle\" level in journey mode features bells and xylophone sounds, which were clear and focused. Some deeper bass sounds, like gongs, were muted at best, however.</p><p>In <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em>, the speakers swelled with orchestral music during a battle, and kept the dialogue clear even over whirring Hydra helicopter blades. And the game got nice and loud, too, easily filling a whole room.</p><h2 id=\"heat-on-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-2\">Heat on the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><p>We measured skin temperatures while running our <em>Metro Exodus</em> stress test. Like other handhelds we've tested, the design ensures your hands don't touch any hotspots. The prongs and controls ran from 84 degrees Fahrenheit at the furthest point to 90 F closer to the screen. On the top, the hottest point was at the exhaust vent, which reached 113.7 F. On the rear, the hottest point was near the intake vent, far enough from the two back  buttons that you wouldn't place your hands there.</p><p>Internally, the CPU package measured an average of 74.7 degrees Celsius, while the integrated graphics reached 70.59 C.</p><h2 id=\"upgradeability-of-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-2\">Upgradeability of the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X</h2><p>Here's one way in which the ROG Xbox Ally X is definitively more like a PC than an Xbox: You can crack it open and upgrade it. The back of the system is held on with eight Phillips-head screws. There are five screws on the back and three on the bottom. Of those, the top middle screw on the rear is captive; the rest all come out.</p><p>You'll have to pry carefully from the top and all the way around the sides of the controllers to get the back off. It can be nerve-wracking and time-consuming, as there are a lot of plastic clips to disengage. But go slow — there's a ribbon cable connecting the back to the motherboard to control the M1 and M2 buttons. I would love to see a design in the future with a door that leads directly to the SSD (perhaps similar to what Microsoft has done on some Surface designs) so you don't have to deal with so many screws and tabs. For those without any DIY PC experience, adding storage with the microSD card slot may be the way to go.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"qP6aBPGs8hykMX6G5vtNTQ\" name=\"opened\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qP6aBPGs8hykMX6G5vtNTQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The major component you can upgrade is the standard M.2 2280 SSD, which is right at the center when you open the system. The battery cable runs over the SSD, and while you'd probably want to disconnect that before doing work anyway, you'll have to do so to have room to remove the existing drive.</p><p>Like the original Ally X, you can see the modular thumbsticks. Since Asus isn't using Hall Effect joysticks, these will probably, eventually, be prone to drift. Asus didn't sell replacement sticks for the initial Ally X, but I'd love to see them do it for this system.</p><h2 id=\"asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-configurations-2\">Asus ROG Xbox Ally X Configurations</h2><p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X comes in a single configuration, with a 7-inch, 1080p display, AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor, 24GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It costs $999.99, up from $799 on the 2024 Ally X with a Z1 Extreme. That's a big jump for the new processor and slightly new design.</p><p>There is another model, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, which ditches the Xbox Ally X's blackout color scheme for a white controller and colorful buttons. That system, which <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/product/rog-xbox-ally-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-a-processor-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-windows/JJGHGPGFL4\"><u>costs $599.99</u></a>, uses an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor, which on paper is similar to what you can find in the Steam Deck OLED. It also has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line-2\">Bottom Line</h2><p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X makes two things very clear:</p><p>1. More handhelds need controller-style prongs.</p><p>2. Windows 11 on gaming handhelds has a chance.</p><p>The Xbox Ally X has superior ergonomics to every other Windows handheld on the market, and will be more comfortable for some than the Steam Deck, which until now has been the best in this area. It looks a little silly, but controllers have those grips for a reason. Add in some great weight-balancing, and you have a comfortable gaming handheld. Too bad it doesn't come with a case to carry it around in.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"GrZfxuC65yisHrmXmN6vVQ\" name=\"on-table-avengers\" alt=\"Asus ROG Xbox Ally X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GrZfxuC65yisHrmXmN6vVQ.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The performance of the Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme is strong, but I'm not sure it's such a jump that if you already have an Asus ROG Ally X with Z1 Extreme, you need to upgrade.</p><p>At $999.99, this is a pricey handheld. Still, there are more fully featured options out there. If you're willing to skip the Xbox Full Screen Experience (for now), the Lenovo Legion Go 2 adds detachable controllers with Hall Effect joysticks and a gorgeous OLED screen, along with more RAM. But that device is bigger and heavier, and is even more expensive at $1,349.99. The Steam Deck OLED, which is cheaper at $549 for 512GB and $649 for 1TB, also has an OLED screen, though its chip quite as powerful as the Z2 Extreme.</p><p>For now, the Xbox Full Screen Experience is exclusive to the Xbox Ally X. All other things being equal, that's the big reason to buy this system. Using it is simply easier, even if Microsoft has plenty of rough edges to clean up.</p><p>If you're just now jumping into the gaming handheld market and want something that just plays games and runs Windows, this is the one to get. It's comfortable and is finally starting to get close to the ease of use that Valve offers with SteamOS. When the Xbox Full Screen Experience becomes available more widely, however, the field may blow open.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ The Asus ROG Xbox Ally X excels in ergonomics and has a full-screen Xbox UI that is easy to use with a controller. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">bQyb3dwoPYKggnfFmYNNXE</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/82BGMATR6jFDfaEb4fPZaQ-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Console Gaming]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Andrew E.

OpenAI, the most well-known AI company behind ChatGPT, is predicting revenue in the low double-digit billions this year and expects to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/openai-sees-5-billion-loss-this-year-on-3point7-billion-in-revenue.html\" target=\"_blank\">make a loss for several more years</a>. Although it's not uncommon for major companies to operate at a loss for some time, the cash burn of OpenAI and others has been on a whole new scale.</p><p>The problem comes if profit has been priced into the investments. Although some will be aware that it will be some time before they see a return on it, many will be expecting the revolution that OpenAI and so many other AI companies have promised. Sweeping upheavals in employment, rapid gains in efficiency and productivity, new business models and products for the potential billions of users all over the world.</p><p>But none of that is happening yet. In the absence of a profitable business model, if investors stop stoking the fires of the AI hype train, it's not clear how far the track can run before the wheels completely fall off. If and when that happens, it'll take a lot more than just a few AI companies with it.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/s-and-p-500-companies-totalling-usd20-trillion-in-market-cap-have-medium-to-high-ai-exposure-concerns-of-an-impending-bubble-collapse-extend-to-almost-half-of-the-index</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Investors are keeping a close eye on potential signs of the AI industry reaching the point of bursting its inflated bubble, as it's revealed that almost half of all the largest companies on the S&P 500 have medium-to-high exposure to AI.

The <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gaming-monitors,4533.html\">best gaming monitors</a> lacked tuners, and most went without the composite or component video inputs required for VCRs and cable boxes. With the advent of digital video, that line is now a blurry one. Today, the only thing different between the two is that TVs don’t have DisplayPort, and monitors don’t have tuners or networking.</p><p>Erasing the line completely is Samsung’s M9 M90SF Smart Monitor. It features DisplayPort with a refresh rate of 165 Hz and Adaptive-Sync for gaming. On the TV side, it has <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/displayport-vs-hdmi-better-for-gaming\">HDMI</a>, Wi-Fi, and Samsung’s TV Plus Streaming interface. Both sides benefit from a 4K OLED panel with wide gamut color, HDR10, and HDR10+. It truly is a desktop monitor and personal TV in one chassis.

Or is it more monitor than TV? That’s what I’m aiming to find out. On the gaming side, it has 165 Hz, Adaptive-Sync, and DisplayPort. TV watchers will appreciate the Wi-Fi with an evolved streaming interface called Samsung TV Plus. It also comes with a remote control befitting a TV, featuring dedicated buttons for Netflix, Prime, and YouTube. And it incorporates a microphone for Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The M9 also includes Bluetooth and Apple AirPlay 2. The only thing missing is an antenna input.</p><p>Both sides benefit from a gorgeous 4K OLED panel with 138ppi pixel density. The color gamut covers around 97% of DCI-P3, which is a bit less than other QD-OLEDs I’ve reviewed. But there is plenty of light output with over 450 nits peak available for HDR10 and HDR10+ formats. If you’re wondering about the plus, HDR10+ is like HDR10 but with dynamic metadata like Dolby Vision. It requires HDR10+ content, which can be found on some Blu-rays and streamed titles. The M9 also features dynamic tone mapping, which can enhance HDR10 material.</p><p>Convenience features abound, starting with a 4K webcam incorporated into the screen bezel. USB ports are included too, with type A and type C accompanying the HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 inputs. A pair of internal speakers delivers five watts of power each.</p><p>For those concerned with panel life, the M9 features a heatpipe system to keep temperatures down, along with logo and taskbar detection, which dims those portions of the screen to minimize pixel wear. A refresh routine can also be run periodically. Samsung backs the M9 with a three-year warranty.</p><p>This is a premium package at $1,599, but as you’re getting the best of three displays in one, it could be considered a bargain. It’s well-suited for small spaces or users who want a single do-it-all panel in their workspace.</p><h2 id=\"assembly-and-accessories-2\">Assembly and Accessories</h2><p>The M9 is securely packaged in crumbly foam and comes in three parts: base, upright, and panel. You’ll need a Phillips-head screwdriver to secure two captive bolts between the metal base plate and the substantial upright. The stand is monolithic when assembled. The panel snaps in place. Samsung includes a 100mm VESA mount for arms and brackets, but no fasteners. The power supply is an enormous brick with a cord long enough to leave it on the floor. You also get USB-C and HDMI cables.</p><h2 id=\"product-360-2\">Product 360</h2><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:74.10%;\"><img id=\"X3ksH8QA6o6Kio5S49TGAL\" name=\"a-front\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X3ksH8QA6o6Kio5S49TGAL.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%;\"><img id=\"HTg4Bki4Z4AUkkBeb85n8L\" name=\"a-side\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTg4Bki4Z4AUkkBeb85n8L.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:79.40%;\"><img id=\"BXpxyyKsgE3RDUrifbt28L\" name=\"a-back\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BXpxyyKsgE3RDUrifbt28L.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"794\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.70%;\"><img id=\"hKZncHxcwXSMLdwJCuic9L\" name=\"a-inputs\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hKZncHxcwXSMLdwJCuic9L.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:507px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:271.79%;\"><img id=\"xqbs9K8CJgpnp55EMhpgJS\" name=\"a-remote\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xqbs9K8CJgpnp55EMhpgJS.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"507\" height=\"1378\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The M9’s styling is the definition of minimalist. There are no textures to be seen except for a small grill visible only in the side view. This vents heat from the heatpipe system and keeps the panel running cool at all times. Heat dissipation is further aided by the panel’s all-metal back cover. Everything else is smoothly finished in silver plastic, except for the thin base, which is a metal plate. The upright is wide and strong with solid ergonomics, 25-degree tilt, 4.6 inches of height, and a 90-degree portrait mode.</p><p>The screen has a matte front layer, which effectively keeps ambient light at bay. It’s a nice departure from the glossy screens most OLEDs have. I could not see any downside as the image was sharp, colorful, and free of visible grain or artifacts. The bezel is wider at the top and bottom than at the sides. And you can see the lens for the 4K camera at the top.</p><p>The M9’s remote is handy for TV watching with a navigation pad in the middle and dedicated buttons for Netflix, Prime, YouTube, and Samsung TV Plus. The house icon takes you to the streaming interface regardless of which input is currently in use. It has a microphone for use with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. The only thing missing is an input selector.</p><p>The input panel faces rearwards, making it easy to access and to feed the cables through the hole in the upright. There is one each of HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, along with a USB-C (90 watts charging) and two USB-A downstream ports. The power cord plugs in with a right-angle connector and goes to a large external power supply. Luckily, the cord is long enough to put the brick on the floor.</p><h2 id=\"osd-features-2\">OSD Features</h2><p>I’ve commented in the past about Samsung Smart Monitors’ confusing menu systems, which attempt to bridge the gap between TV and computer monitor. The M9 is better than its predecessors but still has some room for improvement.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row

navigation. Most of what you’ll need is in the Picture menu, where you’ll find image modes and calibration controls. Expert Settings has a complete set with gamma, two- and twenty-point white balance, color management, video processing, selectable gamuts, and picture enhancements. I noted that the only mode with accurate color was Movie, which meets the BT.709 standard for SDR and DCI-P3 for HDR.</p><p>The Game menu features an Adaptive-Sync toggle, aiming points, and a mini-map detector, which is part of the M9’s panel protection suite. Another game-focused menu can be called up from the remote, which I’ll discuss in a moment.</p><p>The M9’s audio output includes left/right balance and a multi-band equalizer. Auto Volume compresses the dynamic range for better clarity at low volumes.</p><p>Networking is an integral part of the M9’s function, with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth included. Apple AirPlay 2 is supported along with Bluetooth streaming. These functions are managed with Samsung’s SmartThings app.</p><p>Pressing and holding the play/pause button on the remote brings up the game bar, which provides quick access to play aids like the aiming point and sound settings. It also shows signal information and status at the bottom.</p><h2 id=\"samsung-m9-m90sf-calibration-settings-2\">Samsung M9 M90SF Calibration Settings</h2><p>The M9 ships in Eco mode, which is quite dim and will likely only be useful in a darkened room. I measured all the modes and found that Movie came the closest to accurate color standards. It renders BT.709 for SDR and DCI-P3 for HDR. If you want the larger gamut for SDR, choose Native from the color space options. Grayscale tracking is visually perfect, but the indicated BT.1886 gamma is lighter than spec. I used the slider to make it better. My SDR settings are shown below.</p><p>For HDR, you can choose from the same picture modes, but a couple of additional settings become active. For best results there, set HDR Tone Mapping to static and Peak Brightness on Medium. This will work well for HDR10 content, while HDR10+ material will automatically be tone-mapped according to its dynamic metadata. If you want brighter midrange tones, set HDR Tone Mapping to Active.</p><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Picture Mode</p></td><td  ><p>Movie</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Brightness 200 nits</p></td><td  ><p>44</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Brightness 120 nits</p></td><td  ><p>27</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Brightness 100 nits</p></td><td  ><p>23</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Brightness 80 nits</p></td><td  ><p>19</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Brightness 50 nits</p></td><td  ><p>12 (min. 16 nits)</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Contrast</p></td><td  ><p>45</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Gamma</p></td><td  ><p>BT.1886 +1</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Color Temp User</p></td><td  ><p>Gain – Red -3, Green -2, Blue 0</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol empty\" ></td><td  ><p>Bias – Red 0, Green 0, Blue 0</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=\"gaming-and-hands-on-2\">Gaming and Hands-on</h2><p>I spent a few days putting the M9 through its paces as a gaming monitor, TV, and workday tool. Gaming was the first order of business, and there, I liked it very much. I had noted a little motion blur during testing, which is solely due to its 165 Hz refresh rate. This was harder to spot when mowing through aliens in <em>Doom Eternal.</em> I’m definitely spoiled by speedy screens, especially in this category where there are many 240 Hz models. But the M9’s 165 Hz got the job done with low enough input lag and flawless Adaptive-Sync.</p><p>The HDR image was bright and colorful, whether static or moving. I experimented with luminance settings and settled on Static tone mapping and Peak Brightness on Medium. I also set Contrast Enhancer to Medium for a little extra punch in the midtones. This can be used for both HDR and SDR if you wish. I noted that SDR color defaulted to BT.709 while HDR used the M9’s full native color space, which covers around 97% of DCI-P3.</p><p>Working in my go-to apps like Photoshop, Excel, and Word, the M9 proved itself capable of getting through productivity tasks with ease and comfort. The picture is superb with no visible pixel structure, deep contrast, and bright color. The screen’s anti-glare layer enhances contrast by successfully filtering out all ambient light. It’s optically pure and more forgiving than the glossy screens found on most OLEDs. You won’t need to be as thoughtful about placement with the M9.</p><p>Moving to streaming, I browsed a few titles on Netflix, Disney+, and AppleTV+, which were all available from the main screen that appears when you press the Home button on the remote. The video quality of HDR titles from Netflix, such as <em>Formula One Drive to Survive,</em> was exemplary. I noted truly excellent audio as well. Though the M9 has just two internal speakers, they play a wider range of frequencies than typical monitor speakers and with a wider sound stage. There isn’t a ton of bass, but there is clarity and balance. The dialogue in TV shows like <em>Severance</em> was easy to understand and put just forward enough in the mix that I had no need to adjust the volume more than once.</p><p>My only complaint is the menu system. It attempts to adapt itself to each format, showing different options for gaming, desktop, and TV. While it is more integrated than Samsung’s previous efforts, it’s still somewhat confusing. I would prefer to see the same options and picture modes shown in all facets of the M9’s operation. I’d also love to see an input selector button on the remote rather than having to hunt through the OSD to change sources.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: </strong>Gaming monitor, check. 4K HDR TV, check. Productivity display, check. The M9 does everything well. Even though there are faster gaming monitors, you won’t need that extra speed unless you’re a skilled player. For gamers of average ability, it’s smooth and responsive enough for addictive play. It’s also one of the best desktop TVs I’ve experienced, with a gorgeous picture, perfect integration of streaming apps, and easy control with the included remote.

The 240 Hz screens all draw a full white field in 4ms and are visibly smoother in operation than the Samsung or Dell monitors. This can be observed in moving test patterns and in content, where the slower panels exhibit a slight motion blur. It is far less than you’d see from an LCD running at 120 or 165 Hz, but it’s more than the 240 Hz displays that are visually perfect.</p><p>The M9 is quick but not super-quick. You’ll give up around 6ms of input lag, which for most players won’t be an issue. It didn’t affect my experience, but more skilled players might prefer a faster monitor. It should be noted that the hardware requirements for 240fps in 4K are substantial. I test with a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-review\">GeForce RTX 4090</a> and can barely get there. If you have a lesser card, it can’t take advantage of a faster monitor.</p><p><strong>Test Takeaway: </strong>The Samsung M9 is a solidly capable gaming monitor, but not as quick as other screens in its price class. In fairness, the extra cost goes into smart features and streaming, which typical gaming monitors lack. As an all-around entertainment display, nothing else is as full-featured.</p><h2 id=\"viewing-angles-2\">Viewing Angles</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:61.20%;\"><img id=\"4igTSM2bVVg36WvKM9hH4J\" name=\"M9 viewing\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4igTSM2bVVg36WvKM9hH4J.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"612\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The M9 boasts superb off-axis image quality, a hallmark of OLED technology.

Standard covers most of DCI-P3, which is a good thing, but the saturation points are off-target. Red and green are undersaturated between 20 and 80% while blue is a little too vivid. The balance is off, and you can see it in content. Color doesn’t look entirely natural.</p><p>Movie nails the BT.709 gamut for SDR, coming up just a tad short in red with a slight hue error in magenta. Calibration tightens up the chart and fixes the magenta issue.</p><p>If you want the larger gamut in Movie mode, pick Native from the gamut selections. It shows the same behavior I recorded in the Standard mode, with undersaturation in red and green and magenta hue errors. Based on this result, I’d recommend using Auto for the color space setting to keep BT.709 in play for SDR content.</p><h2 id=\"comparisons-4\">Comparisons</h2><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:989px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:74.52%;\"><img id=\"kBTDA4VrthNtVaeddjjY4J\" name=\"11 colorde\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kBTDA4VrthNtVaeddjjY4J.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"989\" height=\"737\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:989px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:88.57%;\"><img id=\"AY36j68xRhf7PvWHDxWX4J\" name=\"12 gamutvol\" alt=\"Samsung M9 M90SF\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AY36j68xRhf7PvWHDxWX4J.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"989\" height=\"876\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you keep the M9 set to Auto color space, it runs with the best professional screens with a 1.26dE gamut error. It doesn’t get much better than that. The wide gamut is best used with HDR content as you’ll see on the next page.</p><p>In the volume test, the M9 managed 97.25% coverage of DCI-P3, which is a bit below average for Quantum Dot monitors. It is in line with non-QD screens, and it is still a very colorful monitor, just less so than the top three. sRGB coverage is just under 95% which makes it suitable for critical applications.</p><p><strong>Test Takeaway: </strong>You have to hunt for the M9’s color accuracy, but in Movie mode, it performs well with the only needed change being to the gamma preset. Grayscale and gamut tracking are spot-on out of the box. My only nitpick here is gamut coverage, which is large but not as large as other Quantum Dot displays.</p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gaming-monitors,4533.html\"><strong>Best Gaming Monitors</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reference/how-we-test-pc-monitors-benchmarking\"><strong>How We Test PC Monitors</strong></a></p><p><strong>MORE: </strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/monitor-buying-guide,5699.html\"><strong>How to Buy a PC Monitor</strong></a></p><p><strong>Our HDR benchmarking uses</strong><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.portrait.com/\"><strong> </strong></a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.portrait.com/\"><strong>Portrait Displays’</strong></a><strong> Calman software.

We really like its sturdy build, and it comes with a box full of accessories, including a braided cable and a DIY switch lube kit to keep your keys buttery smooth. The keycaps are double-shot PBT, which means the keys are made from two pieces to stop them from wearing down over time.</p><p>Our review covered the ROG NX Red switches from Asus. These come with a 1.8mm actuation point and a 40gf initial force rating for snappy input while reducing accidental keystrokes. The ROG NX Snow switches on this particular board have the <em>same</em> actuation point and initial force rating, and a slightly lower total force of just 53gf (compared to 55gf in our review unit). As such, these will feel ever so lighter and more fluid, but ostensibly the same, and of course, with that trademark \"thock\" when you press them.</p><p>The Asus ROG Azoth is available now, sold and shipped directly from Amazon.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more savings, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech\"><em>Best PC Hardware deals</em></a><em> for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds\"><em>SSD and Storage Deals,</em></a><em> </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals\"><em>Hard Drive Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals\"><em>Gaming Monitor Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-graphics-card-deals-now\"><em>Graphics Card Deals</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals\"><em>CPU Deals</em></a><em> pages.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/mechanical-keyboards/asus-accomplished-rog-azoth-is-just-usd155-thanks-to-this-44-percent-amazon-discount-get-your-hands-on-this-almost-perfect-wireless-gaming-keyboard-for-less</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Cheaper than ever before, get an Asus ROG Azoth keyboard for just $155 with this 44% Amazon discount. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">2pV3osDHmCpRCqGs3MBhvj</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BJusNeoBQURHn9RFzLBVL-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 11:47:32 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Mechanical Keyboards]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Peripherals]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Keyboards]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ stephen.warwick@futurenet.com (Stephen Warwick) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Stephen Warwick ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BJusNeoBQURHn9RFzLBVL-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Future / Asus]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Asus ROG Azoth Deal]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Asus ROG Azoth Deal]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BJusNeoBQURHn9RFzLBVL-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Commodore needles Microsoft over end of Windows 10, tries to lure disgruntled users to its Linux-based OS Vision 3.0 — 'Microsoft may be leaving you behind.

Those frustrated with Microsoft’s OS, and its assumed direction of travel given what we’ve seen of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/bypass-windows-11-tpm-requirement\">Windows 11</a> so far, are promised “a reset” rather than an upgrade.</p><p>Key touted attractions of Commodore OS Vision 3.0 are that it is “a totally FREE, modern, Linux-based sanctuary from tech gone too far. Calm. Creative. Privacy-first. Retro-futuristic. No nags. No noise. No tracking. No toxic social media,” says Commodore. Those sound very much like the words and philosophies of its new CEO, Christian ‘<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/retro-gaming/commodore-shocks-retro-techtuber-with-option-to-buy-the-whole-company\">Perifractic</a>’ Simpson.</p><p>To be clear, Commodore OS Vision 3.0 hasn’t just been released to take advantage of Windows users in flux, though. This version of the OS was released back in April.</p><h2 id=\"what-is-special-about-this-35gb-distro-2\">What is special about this 35GB distro?</h2><p>There is a lot going on in this Linux (Debian)-based OS, which partly explains the humongous download. One of the most striking elements of the Commodore OS Vision 3.0 is its uniquely crafted interface, a love letter to the Commodore legacy, which is a retro-futuristic take on UI design.</p><p>Once in the OS, there are lashings of extras. Most notably, the games and demos. This distro includes over 200 free Linux-compatible games, along with a selection of classic Commodore games and demos – thus providing a mix of nostalgia and modernity.</p><p>Another key attraction of this OS is its inclusion of Commodore OS BASIC V1. This included <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/bill-gates-48-year-old-microsoft-6502-basic-goes-open-source\">BASIC interpreter</a> has been bolstered to support 3D graphics, physics, and more. The original Commodore machines sparked a flood of creativity from bedroom coders, and being able to write computer programs without additional software is very much in the DNA of these influential machines.</p><p>Last but not least, as far as highlights go, we must mention the Commodore OS Central.

Chief among them was the announcement that <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/gigawatt-ai-factories-ocp-vera-rubin/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung Foundry has joined NVLink Fusion</a>, the program that allows partners to build semi-custom processors wired directly into Nvidia’s proprietary interconnect fabric.</p><p>Under the deal, Samsung will offer “design-to-manufacturing” support for companies designing custom CPUs and accelerators that integrate Nvidia’s NVLink-C2C interface. That means a customer working with Samsung can now license Nvidia’s IP, tape out a chip on a Samsung process, and plug it straight into an Nvidia-powered rack. For a company that has spent years relying on TSMC’s silicon, this new partnership illustrates that Nvidia wants multiple foundry footholds for the next phase of AI buildout.</p><h2 id=\"samsung-s-foothold-in-nvidia-s-ai-ecosystem-2\">Samsung’s foothold in Nvidia’s AI ecosystem</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"Bwu5y4A2CQbobkUhdypkug\" name=\"samsung-foundry-hero.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bwu5y4A2CQbobkUhdypkug.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung’s entry into NVLink-Fusion gives Nvidia a second major manufacturing partner after TSMC, broadening the program’s appeal to companies that prefer to work outside Taiwan or want access to Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/samsung-takes-a-scalpel-to-its-2nm-wafer-price-tag-bringing-it-down-to-usd20-000-korean-chipmaker-now-undercuts-rival-tsmc-by-33-percent\">advanced 3nm and 2nm nodes</a>. It also marks a subtle shift in power dynamics. By licensing NVLink-C2C and NVLink chiplets to external foundries, Nvidia is effectively turning its interconnect into a platform.</p><p>In practice, Samsung will act as a one-stop shop for NVLink-ready custom chips — from design and verification through to packaging and integration. That could include domain-specific accelerators, AI inference ASICs, or regionally tailored CPUs for hyperscale data centers. The goal isn’t to outsource Nvidia’s own GPUs, but to expand the company’s architecture outward; even chips it doesn’t design could still be part of the NVLink universe.</p><p>This matters because NVLink has become the connective tissue of Nvidia’s AI dominance. Its cache-coherent chip-to-chip interface delivers vastly higher bandwidth and lower latency than PCIe — <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-announces-nvlink-fusion-to-allow-custom-cpus-and-ai-accelerators-to-work-with-its-products\">up to 14 times faster in its latest generation</a>. Grace Hopper, the superchip that anchors Nvidia’s AI servers, was among the first to use NVLink-C2C. NVLink Fusion takes that same idea and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/nvidia-announces-nvlink-fusion-to-allow-custom-cpus-and-ai-accelerators-to-work-with-its-products\">opens it to the wider ecosystem</a>, allowing others to fuse their silicon directly with Nvidia’s.</p><p>By doing so, Nvidia gains the ability to set the terms of integration across an expanding hardware space. Custom chips, alternative CPUs, and even rival accelerators can all coexist, provided that they plug into Nvidia’s proprietary fabric. It’s vertical integration by proxy, ensuring that every new entrant ultimately strengthens Nvidia.</p><h2 id=\"spectrum-x-2\">Spectrum-X</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"ZHJUFrmv6Qr2Ts2bGLyCTm\" name=\"oracle_oci_hero.jpg\" alt=\"Oracle\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHJUFrmv6Qr2Ts2bGLyCTm.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Oracle)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung announcement was only one part of Nvidia’s first day at OCP.

Wells Fargo analysts estimate that Spectrum-X revenue alone has surpassed a $10 billion annualized run rate, growing faster than Nvidia’s GPU business on a percentage basis. The firm notes that Spectrum-X now accounts for the majority of Nvidia’s networking revenue, which hit $7.25 billion last quarter — up 98% year-on-year.</p><div class=\"see-more see-more--clipped\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet hawk-ignore\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wells Fargo) NVIDIA: Meta and Oracle to Use NVIDIA Spectrum-X Ethernet; Concerns About ANET Are OverblownOur ViewThis morning, Meta and Oracle announced they will each use NVIDIA’s Spectrum-X Ethernet for the Facebook Open Switching System (FBOSS) OS and for giga-scale AI… pic.twitter.com/ofsxeRsVMU<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1978054480487993424\">October 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"see-more__filter\"></div></div><p>Those numbers explain why Nvidia is doubling down on Ethernet. Spectrum-X is AI-optimized, designed to deliver 95% utilization across vast GPU clusters where generic Ethernet might only hit 60%. Wells Fargo describes it as “AI-optimized Ethernet over generic off-the-shelf Ethernet,” citing a 1.9 times performance advantage in cross-datacenter communication.</p><p>Even so, analysts caution against assuming Spectrum-X will crush the competition. Wells Fargo’s note argues that concerns over Arista Networks are overblown, pointing out that Arista remains embedded in Meta’s leaf-spine architecture and is already co-developing the “Scale-Up Ethernet” framework with Broadcom at OCP.</p><h2 id=\"vertical-power-and-foundry-diversification-2\">Vertical power and foundry diversification</h2><p>Looked at together, Samsung’s arrival and Spectrum-X’s expansion point to the same endgame: Nvidia is looking to build a self-reinforcing ecosystem where every layer revolves around its technology. It’s the same strategy that has defined its GPU dominance, now extended to the company's data center efforts' structural DNA.</p><p>This isn’t without precedent. As we reported on October 8, Nvidia has been hard at work, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-is-turning-gpus-into-capital-questions-exist-around-circularity\">blurring the lines between chipmaker and financier</a>, with alleged GPU purchases for customers through equity and leaseback schemes. Its new foundry partnerships take that logic deeper into the supply chain, ensuring that even if manufacturing shifts geographically or politically, the intellectual property — the NVLink fabric itself — remains Nvidia’s to control.</p><p>Samsung, for its part, gains validation and diversification. Its most advanced nodes have <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/samsungs-yield-issues-reportedly-delays-taylor-fab-launch-to-2026\">trailed TSMC’s in yield and adoption</a>, but being tapped as an NVLink partner gives it a way in to the most lucrative segment of semiconductor manufacturing, custom AI silicon. It also positions Samsung as a potential counterweight in the foundry race, especially if US-China tensions or Taiwan supply constraints make a second source more valuable to hyperscalers.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/samsung-joins-nvidia-nvlink-fusion</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ The partnership brings Samsung Foundry into Nvidia’s high-speed interconnect ecosystem, expanding NVLink’s reach beyond TSMC and deepening Nvidia’s control over AI system design. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4s98fM4xi2ovaqKgNWbosQ</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YFymL3qMNnApYJB7AiCUZ-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 10:33:03 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Luke James ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YFymL3qMNnApYJB7AiCUZ-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft / Nvidia]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Microsoft deploys GB300 NVL72 supercluster inside Azure]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Microsoft deploys GB300 NVL72 supercluster inside Azure]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2YFymL3qMNnApYJB7AiCUZ-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Frore's new LiquidJet coldplates are designed to handle up to 4,400W of power from Nvidia's Feynman AI GPUs — new design uses semiconductor manufacturing techniques to create 3D jet-channel microstructures ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Frore Systems has introduced LiquidJet, a coldplate that supports existing AI GPUs, such as Nvidia's Blackwell, with a 1,400W thermal design power. It can scale its performance for next-generation processors, such as Nvidia's Feynman, which will feature <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/future-ai-processors-said-to-consume-up-to-15-360w-massive-power-draw-will-demand-exotic-immersion-and-embedded-cooling-tech\">a total power of 4,400W</a>. The new coldplates feature 3D short-loop jet-channel microstructures that increase hotspot power density of a whopping 600 W/cm^2 and reduce pressure loss by four times compared to conventional coldplates. In the end, Frore's LiquidJet is ready for multi-kilowatt AI GPUs set to arrive in the coming years.</p><p>Modern AI GPUs like Nvidia's Blackwell AI system-on-chips (SoCs) consume an extreme amount of power and therefore require liquid cooling. Modern copper coldplates feature relatively long 2D microchannels with small cross sections that are CNC-machined or skived from high-purity copper blocks. Because these microchannels are long, liquid must travel farther and rub against more surface area, which increases hydraulic resistance and reduces pressure, which affects performance. Frore says that its LiquidJet coldplates with 3D short-loop jet channel microstructures reduce hydraulic resistance and therefore maintain higher pressure inside to boost performance.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1276px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:60.50%;\"><img id=\"peVDhmSpBjaG3kxEsyjqx9\" name=\"LiquidJet-Product-Card-FINAL-100825-2.png\" alt=\"Frore Systems\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/peVDhmSpBjaG3kxEsyjqx9.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1276\" height=\"772\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Frore Systems)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Frore says that it has adapted 'semiconductor manufacturing to metal wafers' (which probably includes metal wafer etching and bonding) and can fabricate 3D short-loop jet channel microstructures that are adjusted to hot spot maps of particular processors, greatly improving performance and efficiency, but at a higher cost compared to traditional production methods. Furthermore, since we are talking about semiconductor fab-style production, LiquidJet may have micron-sized features if needed by a particular application.</p><p>The results are pretty staggering, according to Frore. LiquidJet sustains a hotspot density of 600 W/cm^2 at 40°C inlet temperature, twice that of standard coldplates. LiquidJet's heat removal per flow rate rises by 50%, while pressure loss falls by four times, from roughly 0.94 psi to 0.24 psi. As a result, LiquidJet enables lower temperatures and more predictable performance of Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra processor under full load, according to Frore. The unit is drop-in compatible with existing designs.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3282px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:28.95%;\"><img id=\"3ga5f68xLZLZeYsXRAMPZ9\" name=\"LiquidJet-Product-Card-FINAL-100825-performance.jpg\" alt=\"Frore Systems\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ga5f68xLZLZeYsXRAMPZ9.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"3282\" height=\"950\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Frore Systems)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, LiquidJet's design is scalable and adaptable for Nvidia's upcoming processors, such as Rubin (1,800 W), Rubin Ultra (3,600 W), and Feynman (4,400 W). It can also be adjusted for any other processor, as Frore's production method is particularly flexible in terms of adaptability to a particular hot spot map. In addition to cooling down hotter next-generation GPUs, Frore's LiquidJet will also enable other benefits. For example, better cooling enables steadier frequencies, which means more AI tokens per second at the same power budget. Also, lower pressure requirements reduce pump energy, improving power usage efficiency (PUE) and overall total cost of ownership (TCO).</p><p>\"LiquidJet's unique 3D architecture, with customized short-loop jet channel microstructures, sets a new bar for coldplate thermal performance,\" said Seshu Madhavapeddy, CEO and Founder of Frore Systems. \"Just as AirJet redefined active cooling for consumer and edge devices, LiquidJet transforms coldplates into a future-ready platform for the AI Factory.\"</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1629px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:62.25%;\"><img id=\"r3xhApUzGKuTTXhtuDHo2A\" name=\"frore-future-proof.png\" alt=\"Frore Systems\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r3xhApUzGKuTTXhtuDHo2A.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1629\" height=\"1014\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Frore Systems)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Power consumption and heat dissipation of AI accelerators are expected to increase 10-fold in less than a decade, according to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/future-ai-processors-said-to-consume-up-to-15-360w-massive-power-draw-will-demand-exotic-immersion-and-embedded-cooling-tech\">estimates by KAIST</a>, a leading Korean research institute.

But one cooling paradigm you might not have heard of is spray cooling, used by some supercomputers. Famous German overclocker Der8auer showed off the capabilities of spray cooling in a recent video, cooling a Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU by spraying a non-conductive mist right on top of the IHS.</p><p>Spray cooling functions just as it sounds; nozzles are placed above a CPU or GPU that sprays mist right on top of the chip itself. Depending on the coolant used, the mist will evaporate after hitting the chip (while the chip is active and running warm/hot) and returns to the cooling loop, where the vapor cools off, turns back into a liquid, and cycles back toward the CPU. If this sounds familiar, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/air-cooling/deepcool-assassin-vc-elite-review\">vapor chamber coolers</a> use the same phase change principle.</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEBSuk20gvc\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>To demonstrate what a CPU looks like that is tailor-made for spray cooling, Der8auer showcased a Cray X1 supercomputer processor from 2003, designed from the ground up for spray cooling. Compared to a regular CPU that has an <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/integrated-heat-spreader-ihs-definition,5747.html\">IHS</a>, the Cray X1 is pre-packaged in a stainless-steel clamshell that features some of the components needed for spray cooling baked into the clamshell.</p><p>On the inside of the clamshell are a plethora of tiny nozzles that aim at the chip's eight dies. Der8auer notes that the direction of each nozzle and the pressure at which the fluid is flowing are all critical elements to ensuring each die is fully covered in liquid. If even a small portion of one of the dies is not covered in liquid, it could lead to overheating in that particular spot.</p><p>Furthermore, Der8auer states that the coolant itself is critical to ensuring that any chip cooled by spray cooling stays at the right temperature. Primarily, the coolant needs to be non-conductive, with a low boiling point, so that the fluid can phase change at the right temperature. If the boiling point is too high, the fluid won't change into a vapour, trapping heat inside the chip.</p><p>To test spray cooling, Der8auer jerry-rigged a cooling setup comprised of a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review-devastating-gaming-performance\">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a> with a custom-loop cooling system modified to support a vaporizer. The system is comprised of two separate loops, one supplies coolant to the vaporrizer, and the other pushes high-pressure air, which mixes with the coolant to form the mist.</p><p>Despite not covering the whole IHS, the jerry-rigged spray cooling system was able to successfully cool the 9800X3D. It wasn't able to cool it as well as a traditional CPU cooler, but it was enough for Der8auer to run through a single Cinebench R23 test without overheating. Achieving 18,164 points at around 95C. (To contrast, the 9800X3D normally hits around 23,000 points in R23 with a proper cooler.)</p><p>Der8auer's test might seem underwhelming, but its worth pointing out again that the vaporizer was only cooling a small portion of the IHS. If the IHS were fully enveloped, with a properly tuned vapor cooling setup, it's possible that the results could have been different.</p><p>Vapor cooling is one of the most potent cooling solutions for semiconductor chips. Its cooling potential is directly connected to the flow rate of the coolant, making it exceptionally effective at cooling CPUs.</p><p>Despite its capabilities, spray cooling is not widely used and is almost exclusive to the supercomputing space. But even then, only a handful of supercomputers ever used spray cooling (including the Cray-2).</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/ber8auer-rigs-up-exotic-spray-cooling-for-ryzen-7-9800x3d-but-dont-get-excited-just-yet-supercomputer-cooling-method-underperforms-due-to-partial-ihs-coverage</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Famous German overclocker Der8auer tests spray cooling, a cooling solution used in supercomputers, on a Ryzen 7 9800X3D with decent results.

You’ve seen the headline, and there’s a lot to take in, but the essence of the indictment is that the alleged scammer, Chen Zhi, is accused of hoarding <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chairman-prince-group-indicted-operating-cambodian-forced-labor-scam-compounds-engaged\">$15 billion in Bitcoin</a>, raked in from a sophisticated ‘pig butchering’ operation run out of Cambodia. Moreover, Zhi is said to have run much of his lucrative fraud and money laundering business using trafficked forced labor.</p><p>‘Pig butchering’ scams are characterized by con artists emotionally manipulating victims into investing in fake schemes. It is a ‘long con,’ as there is a period of building trust and delivering small or false gains before the victims are financially ‘slaughtered.’ At this point, the con artist takes a large payoff – often severely or completely draining their victim’s funds.</p><h2 id=\"prince-group-was-an-unprincely-organization-2\">Prince Group was an unprincely organization</h2><p>Chen Zhi, a UK and Cambodian national, is the founder and chairman of a multinational business conglomerate called Prince Group. This 37-year-old has now been formally charged “with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy for directing Prince Group’s operation of forced-labor scam compounds across Cambodia,” says the DoJ press release.</p><p>Prince Group was set up ostensibly as a real estate development, financial services, and consumer services business back in 2015. However, this seems to have evolved into a cover operation for “one of Asia’s largest transnational criminal organizations,” according to the FBI. Such was its success that the firm was enjoying “enormous profits,” top execs enjoyed lavish lifestyles, and Prince Group controlled business entities in over 30 countries.</p><h2 id=\"127-271-btc-seized-2\">127,271 BTC seized</h2><p>A total of 127,271 <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-rockets-to-all-time-high-of-over-usd125-000-rise-fueled-by-increase-in-u-s-equities-and-interest-in-bitcoin-etfs\">bitcoin</a> in Zhi’s possession was seized by the DoJ, which characterizes the funds as ill-gotten gains. Specifically, the accused is said to have collected this hoard by fraud and money laundering.</p><p>“Today the FBI and partners executed one of the largest financial fraud takedowns in history,” said FBI Director Kash Patel. “This is an individual who allegedly operated a vast criminal network across multiple continents involving forced labor, money laundering, investment schemes, and stolen assets — targeting millions of innocent victims in the process. Justice will be done and I’m proud of the men and women of the FBI who executed the mission faithfully.”</p><h2 id=\"vertically-integrated-crime-2\">Vertically integrated crime </h2><p>It is rare to see such a strongly vertically integrated criminal venture exposed. Investigations indicate that victims at one end of the operation were defrauded out of millions of dollars. That’s just for Prince Group’s Brooklyn office, which apparently transferred and laundered funds from over 250 victims.</p><p>At the other end of the operation, hundreds of workers were trafficked and forced to work in compounds in Cambodia and execute the scams, often under the threat of violence, says the DoJ’s press release.</p><p>Meanwhile, between these two extremes, Prince Group execs would be busy using “spraying” and “funneling” techniques to obfuscate flows of funds.</p><h2 id=\"zhi-awaits-trial-but-prince-group-has-already-been-dethroned-2\">Zhi awaits trial, but Prince Group has already been dethroned</h2><p>If convicted, Zhi could face up to 40 years in prison. However, Prince Group’s fate seems to have already been decided. On Tuesday, the firm was designated as “a transnational criminal organization” by U.S. and UK authorities. If you know anything about, or have had dealings with Zhi, or Prince Group, the FBI have opened up a tips line at PrinceGroupTips@fbi.gov.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptocurrency/doj-seizes-usd15-billion-in-bitcoin-from-cambodian-fraudster-who-ran-pig-butchering-scam-using-forced-labor-accused-could-face-40-years-in-prison-following-departments-biggest-ever-crypto-confiscation</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ The DoJ has seized $15 billion in Bitcoin, thought to be proceeds from a 'pig butchering' scam run from forced-labor compounds in Cambodia. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">KsrfgaLwWQeMWwp8CQytKS</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vs2GaM7NCLpRQPvRqNQWrD-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:27:05 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Mark Tyson ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vs2GaM7NCLpRQPvRqNQWrD-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[U.S. Department of Justice]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Images from the UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK filing]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Images from the UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK filing]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vs2GaM7NCLpRQPvRqNQWrD-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Adata chairman says AI datacenters are gobbling up hard drives, SSDs, and DRAM alike — insatiable upstream demand could soon lead to consumer shortages ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AI datacenters are eating up the world's supply standard DRAM memory, NAND flash for SSDs, and hard drives. Adata chairman Simon Chen just made it extremely clear that in his three-decade tenure in the industry, he's never witnessed a simultaneous shortage of all of the aforementioned components, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20251014PD209/dram-hdd-nand-price-capacity-production-adata.html\">via a <em>DigiTimes Asia</em> report</a>.</p><p>Chen goes on to explicitly state that Adata and its usual competitors aren't fighting between themselves for supply in what would be businesss as usual. Instead, cloud service providers (CSPs) — almost always AI datacenters in this day and age — are now gobbling up all available capacity of these components.</p><p>As if all that wasn't enough, Chen believes that the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/expect-hdd-ssd-shortages-as-ai-rewrites-the-rules-of-storage-hierarchy-multiple-companies-announce-price-hikes-too\">shortage of hard drives</a> is incentivizing customers to try and purchase SSDs for non-volatile storage needs instead, further twisting the spiral of storage scarcity. Adata's sales team has purportedly gotten instructions to \"sell sparingly\" and \"give priority to loyal customers\" in turn.</p><p>Additionally, the inventory at upstream suppliers is charitably described as barebones, with only two to three weeks' worth of supply, down from the usual two-to-three months of capacity. In other words, that means that SK hynix, Samsung, Micron, Kioxia, and Western Digital are selling most everything they make to AI projects.</p><p>In case you're not entirely convinced of how big a deal Chen's suspicion-confirming statements are, Adata had a 11% share in the SSD market in 2024, and holds a 5% slice of the memory market. Those are small percentages, but they're for the entire world, meaning that Adata purchases memory and flash chips at large volumes and careful negotiated prices. The deals are likely done multiple months in advance, and Adata certainly would otherwise have far bigger negotiation power than, say, Joe's Discount Memory.</p><p>The company's stock price has climbed sky-high since August, and it hit a 15-year revenue high in Q2 2025. That's keeping in tandem with the general industry trend, with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20250902-12694.html\">DRAM revenue jumping 17.1%</a> in the past fiscal quarter, and enterprise SSD revenue boosting by 12.7%. Even CPU/GPU chipmakers are <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-could-charge-up-to-usd45-000-for-1-6nm-wafers-rumors-allege-a-50-percent-increase-in-pricing-over-prior-gen-wafers\">charging gigantic premiums</a> for their top-shelf wares, too.</p><p>All of this AI-fueled demand is now affecting the supply chain for all modern consumer electronics. Most any advanced device, including phones, TVs, consoles, and cars, all need one or more of the components that are now in high demand. If you're on the fence on whether to purchase a new handset, computer, or television, you'd be wise to consider moving sooner rather than later. Even if AI isn't taking all of our jobs, it seems poised to take all of our silicon.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/big-tech/adata-chairman-says-ai-datacenters-are-gobbling-up-hard-drives-ssds-and-dram-alike-insatiable-upstream-demand-could-soon-lead-to-consumer-shortages</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Adata chairman says AI datacenters are gobbling up all memory and storage. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">zggLnxZonY9LpTuxMxe5LZ</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VXqwFn42DWwQXki8qMowU-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:24:18 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Big Tech]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Bruno Ferreira ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VXqwFn42DWwQXki8qMowU-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Getty / Portra]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Empty warehouse shelves]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Empty warehouse shelves]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8VXqwFn42DWwQXki8qMowU-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ This 'gaming PC' is actually a Bluetooth speaker — replica pumps out the jams with faux dual GPUs, liquid cooling, and RGB ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.edifier.com/cn/product/product-866.html\">Edifier</a> has introduced a new speaker that could easily be mistaken for a compact gaming PC. The Huazai New Cyber resembles a high-end system from the dual-GPU setup to imitation liquid cooling, making it a fascinating (or befuddling) blend of design and functionality.</p><p>With dimensions of 11.6 x 5.9 x 8.4 inches (293.6 x 150.7 x 213.6 mm), the Huazai New Cyber is comparable in size to a small-form-factor (SFF) case. The speaker, available in Aurora White or Phantom Night Black colors, is divided into two sections. The upper section is purely for looks, while the lower section hides the speakers.</p><p>The RGB lighting on the imitations of the cooling fans and memory modules is fully functional. Edifier has also incorporated a 2.8-inch display into the liquid cooler to emulate contemporary high-end liquid cooling systems. This screen effectively displays animations, lyrics for songs, or various graphics. It can provide somewhat more compelling functionality when the Huazai New Cyber is connected to your PC. Upon establishing communication, the display can show the processor's load, the graphics card's load, and memory utilization.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"fuWTdgYKEnkp8aTUJabN2g\" name=\"1\" alt=\"Huazai New Cyber\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fuWTdgYKEnkp8aTUJabN2g.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Edifier)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1131px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.23%;\"><img id=\"C495LdRoXR8fEqF6cuZFi6\" name=\"4\" alt=\"Huazai New Cyber\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C495LdRoXR8fEqF6cuZFi6.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1131\" height=\"636\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Edifier)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"xcnYDEgLtB4zZzdAEwJR2g\" name=\"3\" alt=\"Huazai New Cyber\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xcnYDEgLtB4zZzdAEwJR2g.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Edifier)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Huazai New Cyber features a 2.1 audio configuration comprising a pair of 2-inch (52 mm) drivers. A 4-inch (100 mm) subwoofer enhances the overall sound output with depth and bass. Edifier also added two passive radiators to improve the bass reproduction. A 60W power amplifier drives the two 10W drivers and the 40W subwoofer.</p><p>The rear of the speaker features a USB Type-A port alongside a USB Type-C port, each capable of delivering up to 35W of charging power. Consequently, the Huazai New Cyber can double as a USB hub and charging station. Users may connect their PC or smartphone via a standard USB connection or 3.5mm audio jack, or connect wirelessly with Bluetooth 6.</p><p>Edifier has commenced sales of the Huazai New Cyber speaker within the Chinese market at a price of 1,499 yuan, or approximately $210.

The collaboration, first reported by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-working-softbanks-arm-broadcom-ai-chip-effort\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Information</em></a>, would see Arm design a server-class CPU that anchors OpenAI’s next-generation AI racks, potentially representing one of Arm’s biggest steps into the data center market to date.</p><p>The chip in question is OpenAI’s in-house AI accelerator, part of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/openai-broadcom-to-co-develop-10gw-of-custom-ai-chips\">plans announced on October 13</a> to deploy custom AI accelerators and rack systems in collaboration with Broadcom. The SoC, specialized for inference workloads, is expected to enter production in late 2026 and scale up to support roughly 10 gigawatts of compute capacity between 2026 and 2029. The Broadcom accelerator, said to be fabricated by TSMC, has been in development for roughly 18 months.</p><p>According to <em>The Information</em>, Arm’s new role goes well beyond supplying architectural blueprints. The company has recently started designing and manufacturing its own CPUs rather than just licensing cores to partners, and sees the OpenAI contract as a chance to expand its server ambitions. People familiar with the discussions told the outlet that OpenAI could use the Arm-designed CPU not only with its Broadcom chip, but also with systems from Nvidia and AMD.</p><p>The potential revenue from OpenAI’s CPU program could reach into the billions, the report also said, representing a major windfall for SoftBank, which owns nearly 90% of Arm and has borrowed heavily against its stake. SoftBank has also pledged to invest tens of billions of dollars into OpenAI’s data center build-out and to buy AI technology from the startup to help accelerate Arm’s own chip development cycle.</p><p>Together with earlier agreements with Nvidia and AMD, OpenAI says its chip programs now total as much as 26GW of planned data center capacity. If successful, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/open-ai-building-its-own-chip-still-dependent-on-nvidia\">OpenAI’s custom chip</a> deployments could reach a total installed base that analysts estimate could cost more than $1 trillion in construction and equipment in tandem with its Nvidia and AMD purchases.</p><p>The OpenAI–Broadcom chip could also give the ChatGPT developer more leverage in pricing talks with Nvidia, whose H100 and forthcoming Blackwell GPUs still dominate the AI training market. If Broadcom and TSMC can scale production, OpenAI’s inference chips may offer a partial hedge against the tight GPU supply that has constrained AI labs for much of the past year.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/openai-arm-partner-on-custom-cpu-for-broadcom-chip</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ OpenAI is reportedly working with SoftBank-owned Arm on a new CPU to complement the custom AI accelerator it is co-developing with Broadcom. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">aXGVNemavY9mpoJdgYFv7D</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MCLcg7RKskB3Mk55qVgWPP-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 18:18:36 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[CPUs]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Luke James ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MCLcg7RKskB3Mk55qVgWPP-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Arm]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[The Arm office in Munich, Germany]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[The Arm office in Munich, Germany]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MCLcg7RKskB3Mk55qVgWPP-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Intel unveils Crescent Island, an inference-only GPU with Xe3P architecture and 160GB of memory  ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Intel on Tuesday formally introduced its next-generation Data Center GPU explicitly designed to run inference workloads, wedding 160 GB of LPDDR5X onboard memory with relatively low power consumption. The new unit is codenamed Crescent Island, and it will use the company&apos;s upcoming Xe3P architecture when it hits the market next year. </p><p>Intel&apos;s inference-optimized Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island will carry a GPU (perhaps two) based on the Xe3P architecture, which is a performance-enhanced version of the Xe3 architecture used in the Core Ultra 300-series &apos;Panther Lake&apos; processors for laptops and compact desktops. The GPU is said to support a &apos;broad range of data types&apos; relevant for inference workloads and cloud providers. Unfortunately, there is no word regarding the estimated performance for the part. However, there are still some hints in Intel&apos;s press release. </p><p>The board will carry 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory (a lot more than one typically expects from a graphics card), which suggests the usage of many LPDDR5X devices. An LPDDR5X DRAM IC features two 16-bit channels, so its total interface width is 32 bits. The highest-capacity LPDDR5X die is 32 GB (8 Gb), so 20 of such chips are needed to equip a graphics card with 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. This means that the card either carries one massive GPU with an unprecedented 640-bit wide memory interface connecting all 20 memory devices, or two smaller GPUs, each with a 320-bit memory interface and equipped with 10 memory devices. In both cases, it means that Intel will have two high-end graphics processors for inference, and the only question is whether these can also process graphics. </p><p>Keep in mind that since LPDDR5X DRAMs feature two fully independent 16-bit channels, they cannot support butterfly mode (like GDDR6 or GDDR7), so it is impossible to connect 20 ICs using a single 320-bit interface to one GPU. </p><p>Intel says that its inference-optimized Data Center GPU codenamed Crescent Island will be &apos;power and cost optimized for air-cooled enterprise servers,&apos; so we would not expect the company to build a near-reticle-sized GPU for these cards. </p><p>Intel plans to start sampling its Crescent Island products sometime in the second half of 2026. The company already has samples, and we might hear more details about their performance at the OCP conference or the SC25 trade show.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/intel-unveils-crescent-island-an-inference-only-gpu-with-xe3p-architecture-and-160gb-of-memory</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Intel has unveiled its Crescent Island data center GPU for inference, built on the Xe3P architecture and equipped with 160 GB of LPDDR5X memory. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">DdQoRFhiSPgUUgPWWaRKkB</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qAuWorrwTksrwq4GhoeEL-1280-80.png\" type=\"image/png\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 17:00:29 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[GPUs]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qAuWorrwTksrwq4GhoeEL-1280-80.png\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3qAuWorrwTksrwq4GhoeEL-1280-80.png\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ AMD debuts Helios rack-scale AI hardware platform at OCP Global Summit 2025 — promises easier serviceability and 50% more memory than Nvidia's Vera Rubin ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AMD has <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/blogs/2025/amd-helios-ai-rack-built-on-metas-2025-ocp-design.html\" target=\"_blank\">showcased its Helios next-generation AI hardware platform</a> built for the Meta OpenRack Wide form-factor at the Open Compute Project Global Summit in San Jose, California.

It was developed to improve power, cooling, and serviceability for AI systems. Supporting this and OPC standards will allow AMD partners to scale up faster and more effectively, AMD claims.</p><p>“Open collaboration is key to scaling AI efficiently,” said Forrest Norrod, executive VP and GM of the Data Center Solutions Group, AMD. “With ‘Helios,’ we’re turning open standards into real, deployable systems — combining AMD Instinct GPUs, EPYC CPUs, and open fabrics to give the industry a flexible, high-performance platform built for the next generation of AI workloads.”</p><p>Each of the MI450 GPUs deployed as part of the Helios system will have access to up to 432GB of HBM4 memory, with a total bandwidth of 19.6 TB/s. With 72 of those GPUs in each Helios system, it should be able to deliver 1.4 exaFLOPS of FP8 performance, with 31TB of HBM4 memory overall.</p><p>AMD even took a swipe at Nvidia in the announcement, claiming that this will work out to 50% greater memory capacity than Nvidia's next-generation Vera Rubin will offer.</p><p>AMD also announced the first customers with this Helios system. In what's described as an \"expansion of their long-standing, multi-generation collaboration,\" AMD has partnered with Oracle for the first deployment of the Helios rack system. It will involve <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/amd-and-oracle-partner-to-deploy-50-000-mi450-instinct-gpus-in-new-ai-superclusters-deployment-of-expansion-set-for-2026-powered-by-amds-helios-rack\">Oracle deploying some 50,000 MI450 GPUs</a> starting in Q3 2026, with more to come in 2027.</p><p>That shows strong confidence from potential customers already. Although consumers will need to wait for Nvidia and AMD to launch next-generation graphics products designed for gaming, AI developers have a big head start and a better idea of what's coming down the pipe. Although everyone is scrambling for any compute power they can get for AI data center developments, if AMD's hardware couldn't at least offer credible competition to Nvidia's future Vera Rubin designs, it wouldn't be striking deals like this.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/amd-debuts-helios-rack-scale-ai-hardware-platform-at-ocp-global-summit-2025-promises-easier-serviceability-and-50-percent-more-memory-than-nvidias-vera-rubin</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ AMD has showcased its new Helios rack-scale AI hardware platform based on the Open Rack Wide standard developed by Meta.

But Nvidia isn't the only company with powerful AI hardware, and AMD's next-generation Instinct GPUs are, at least on paper, a fair competitor for what <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidias-rubin-gpu-and-vera-cpu-data-center-ai-platforms-begin-tape-out-both-chips-in-fab-and-on-track-for-2026\">Nvidia has now and what it has coming next in Vera Rubin</a>. That suggestion, partnered with an insatiable demand for AI compute power, has led to AMD making some serious deals with some very serious AI companies; That now includes Oracle.</p><p>The new supercluster Oracle is developing will use AMD's Helios rack system, which combines AMD next-generation Instinct MI450 graphics cards with Venice (<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-mobile-cpu-roadmap-leak-claims-zen-6-arrives-in-2027\">Zen 6</a>) Epyc CPUs, as well as AMD's next-generation <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/inside-the-ai-accelerator-arms-race-amd-nvidia-and-hyperscalers-commit-to-annual-releases-through-the-decade\" target=\"_blank\">advanced networking hardware, codenamed Vulcano</a>. Designed for use in both training and inference workloads, AMD positions this combination much like Nvidia does with its NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 clusters, which combine Nvidia Blackwell graphics chips with Grace Hopper processors. It's an all-in-one package that allows companies like Oracle to quickly scale up compute performance for AI workloads.</p><p>\"Through our decade-long collaboration with AMD—from EPYC to AMD Instinct accelerators—we’re continuing to deliver the best price-performance, open, secure, and scalable cloud foundation in partnership with AMD to meet customer needs for this next era of AI,\" Oracle said in a statement.</p><p>Although AMD's Zen 6 Epyc CPUs and MI450 graphics chips aren't ready yet - the Oracle deployment won't happen until the latter half of 2026 - AMD has already talked a big game about them. It claims they'll be hotly competitive with Nvidia, and even described it as being like the 2021 moment in consumer CPUs, where it finally eclipsed the then-king of the industry, Intel.

It feels like an eviction.</p><p>Over the last several months, users have been scrambling to prepare for life after Windows 10. Microsoft offers a stopgap in the form of Extended Security Updates (ESU) — a one-year lifeline that costs either a $30 one-time fee or, tellingly, a Microsoft Account and OneDrive signup. (Users in the EEA <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-10-extended-support-is-now-free-but-only-in-europe-microsoft-capitulates-on-controversial-usd30-esu-price-tag-which-remains-firmly-in-place-for-the-u-s\">just have to sign in with an MS account</a>.) Others have moved to Linux, Mac, or other alternatives. Still, some have chosen a quieter resistance: staying on Windows 10 without updates, reasoning that it will work for at least a few more years before unpatched exploits make that too risky.</p><p>What unites all three groups is fatigue. After a decade of \"as-a-service\" computing, Windows users are tired of fighting the operating system that is supposed to work for them, not the other way around.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"SY5VqeWBuCAwXahDyD35qb\" name=\"windows10update\" alt=\"Windows 10 laptop updating.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SY5VqeWBuCAwXahDyD35qb.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Clint Patterson/Unsplash)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Windows 10 launched in 2015, Microsoft sold it as the end of version churn. Updates would be continual, seamless, and free, marking the beginning of Windows as a \"living platform.\" In practice, that meant Windows 10 became the prototype for an entirely new relationship between user and machine: one mediated by Microsoft's servers. Telemetry was always on, and updates were always coming. Cortana listened <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/disable-cortana-windows-10,5846.html\">whether you wanted her to or not</a>, and everything you typed in your Start search got sent to Redmond.</p><p>Still, for all its faults, Windows 10 found its footing. It booted fast, ran more-or-less reliably, and crucially, it allowed people to ignore the majority of its \"cloud integration\" if they chose. The operating system still mostly felt like a tool, not a portal. Then came Windows 11, and the line between tool and service finally collapsed.</p><p>Users' frustration with Windows 11 isn't born of Luddism, miserliness, or nostalgia. It's that the \"new\" operating system — \"new\" as it has actually been out for four years already — represents the culmination of a long cultural drift inside Microsoft that treats the computer less as personal property and more as a rented interface to corporate infrastructure. Microsoft has largely ignored negative feedback since its release, and the frustrations have mounted high.</p><p>Users' complaints are everywhere: a taskbar that can't be repositioned, a Start menu that favors web results over local ones, nagging users to use Edge, first-party bloatware that reinstalls itself after every update, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-11-sends-user-data-to-third-party-services\" target=\"_blank\">third-party bloatware that siphons your data</a>, telemetry that cannot be fully disabled unless you're running an Enterprise edition, and even Office defaulting to OneDrive for every saved file. Windows 11's most basic interface, the Start Menu, has been gloriously redesigned in React Native to be slower and heavier than ever before. Every single part of the operating system feels like a triumph of form over function.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:806px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:82.51%;\"><img id=\"T93BYcDkc6uNJtzVfeVtVg\" name=\"windows-10-search-result-estradiol\" alt=\"A screenshot of Windows 10 search, showing an internet result for hormones instead of the file I wanted.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T93BYcDkc6uNJtzVfeVtVg.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"806\" height=\"665\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">I wanted \"Estimate.docx\", not a web search for hormones. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also the elaborate security theater based on threat models designed for corporate IT departments and then inflicted upon individuals: features like Windows Defender that can't truly be disabled, prompts about Windows Firewall if you turn it off, cumulative updates that cannot be declined in part or in whole, and background services that refuse to stay dead.</p><p>This paternalism didn't start yesterday, or even with Windows 10; Microsoft's confidence in its own correctness has been part of the company's DNA for at least thirty years. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsofts-windows-95-release-was-30-years-ago-today-the-first-time-software-was-a-pop-culture-smash\">Windows 95</a> marked the first real step toward locking users out of their own machines. Windows 95 decided it knew better, that managing the OS internals was too dangerous for mortals, and hid them away behind layers of menus and wizards. Later came the forced integration of Internet Explorer, which was so audaciously anti-choice that the U.S. Department of Justice eventually had to intervene.</p><p>In 2001, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/40-years-of-windows-how-windows-xp-changed-everything\">Windows XP</a> brought product activation — a radical concept considered draconian at the time — and a dumbed-down user interface. Vista followed, over-engineered for a hardware future that hadn't arrived yet and throttled by intrusive User Account Control prompts. Users rebelled by staying on XP for nearly a decade until Windows 7 arrived, not that it was actually materially different from Windows Vista on the most contentious points.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/windows-8-review,3334-3.html\">release of Windows 8 in late 2012</a> was arguably the purest expression of Microsoft's \"father knows best\" attitude. It replaced the familiar desktop with a tablet-centric Start Screen, insisting that everyone wanted the same full-screen \"Metro\" experience, whether they had a touchscreen or not. Businesses and power users revolted, and Microsoft hastily backtracked with 8.1 — arguably the last major release to <em>increase</em> user agency, instead of eroding it.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.67%;\"><img id=\"z8A4yqBsTnvPc9ssbKyLzV\" name=\"windows-8-tablet-pc\" alt=\"A photograph of a Surface tablet displaying Windows 8.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8A4yqBsTnvPc9ssbKyLzV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Windows 8 isn't even recognizable as Windows if you weren't there at the time. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Image by <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/pix1861-468748/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=528464\" target=\"_blank\">Csaba Nagy</a> from Pixabay)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By the time Windows 10 arrived in 2016, the company had fully embraced Silicon Valley's new favorite paradigm: \"software as a service.\" The operating system became a recurring relationship, not a product you owned; updates and telemetry were no longer optional, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/operating-systems/microsoft-patches-tpm-20-bypass-to-prevent-windows-11-installs-on-pcs-with-unsupported-cpus\">tedious security features</a> came pre-installed and locked in place, and the line between local computing and the cloud began to blur (or at least, that was Microsoft's intention).</p><p>Many of these changes do stem from legitimate concerns. The modern internet is hostile, and unsecured machines can become easy botnet fodder. The average user doesn't want to manage updates or antivirus software. Microsoft's paternalism is in part a by-product of trying to protect people from their own neglect.</p><p>The problem is that every single one of these changes makes assumptions about what the user wants or needs, and in many cases, there's no route back from Microsoft's opinionated defaults. It's true that backups are good and that most people are negligent about doing them. That doesn't mean the OS should throw up \"security warnings\" because you didn't sign up for OneDrive. It's also true that some people enjoy AI assistants. However, deeply integrating it into every aspect of a PC without the user's consideration is frustrating to witness.</p><p>A clear line can be drawn at how the company's solutions serve its own business interests first and foremost. Each layer of automation, every bit of forced integration — OneDrive, Edge, Bing, Copilot, Recall — makes Windows more dependent on Microsoft's ecosystem. You can almost hear the villainous declaration from on high in the corporate boardrooms: \"If giving users control makes things messy, then simply remove their control!\"</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"D86ThTndsqAXLg7y3HL8ZP\" name=\"macbook-keyboard-command-key\" alt=\"A close-up shot of a Macbook keyboard, highlighting the command key.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D86ThTndsqAXLg7y3HL8ZP.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">In some ways, even Macs are more configurable than Windows PCs these days. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Pixabay / <a href=\"https://pixabay.com/users/creativenerdtim-825504/?utm_source=link-attribution&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=image&utm_content=661273\" target=\"_blank\">Tim</a>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That logic might make sense for casual consumers, but it alienates the enthusiasts and professionals who still define the Windows experience. Casual users have largely moved on to smartphones, tablets, and Chromebooks; Windows 11 is <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/pc-building/50-years-after-its-inception-desktop-pcs-are-less-popular-than-ever-but-heres-why-theyll-never-go-away\">increasingly seen as an unwieldy relic for nerds</a>. For power users, Windows 11 isn't just inconvenient; it's insulting. The OS has become deeply opinionated software aimed at a hypothetical user who is happily served by their smartphone or tablet.</p><p>As Windows 10 fades into obsolescence, the argument it leaves behind is more philosophical than technical. What should an operating system be: a tool, or a service? A tool is something you wield, something you control. A service is something you accept, that you acquiesce to. When an update resets your settings, when telemetry can't be disabled, and when your desktop becomes a marketing vector for cloud subscriptions, none of that is a neutral design choice — it's a tacit declaration about who's really in charge.</p><p>Indeed, Windows 11 makes it crystal clear: the computer exists to serve Microsoft's vision, not yours. That, more than any missing feature or bloated process, is why <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-10-extended-support-is-now-free-but-only-in-europe-microsoft-capitulates-on-controversial-usd30-esu-price-tag-which-remains-firmly-in-place-for-the-u-s\">users cling to Windows 10</a> even as support ends. They're not merely resisting change; they're defending a shrinking space of autonomy in a world where every machine wants to manage them, instead of the other way around.</p><p>Just as Microsoft said, Windows 10 truly was <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-drops-windows-10-support-2025\">the last version of Windows</a> — in spirit, at least — because it was the last one that pretended to belong to the user. Today's end-of-support deadline isn't just a technical milestone; it's a symbolic one. A decade after promising to end the version treadmill, Microsoft has built a new kind of treadmill altogether: one that moves beneath you whether you like it or not. What comes next looks less like an operating system and more like a subscription shell; a managed habitat where every click, every login, and every saved document routes through Microsoft's cloud.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\"

href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-project-digits-desktop-ai-supercomputer-fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand-usd3-000-to-bring-1-pflops-of-performance-home\" target=\"_blank\">got its first star turn at CES this year</a> and was penciled in for a May launch date at the show, but the platform <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidias-desktop-pc-chip-holdup-purportedly-tied-to-windows-delays-ongoing-chip-revisions-and-weakening-demand-also-blamed\" target=\"_blank\">has since experienced delays</a> on its road to market. Whatever wrinkles were preventing a launch have apparently been ironed out. Nvidia has announced that DGX Spark systems <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-dgx-spark-arrives-for-worlds-ai-developers\" target=\"_blank\">will be available to buy</a> starting October 15, both from Nvidia itself and from partners including Dell, Asus, MSI, and HP.</p><p>As a refresher, the DGX Spark <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-project-digits-desktop-ai-supercomputer-fits-in-the-palm-of-your-hand-usd3-000-to-bring-1-pflops-of-performance-home\" target=\"_blank\">is a Grace Blackwell GB10-powered mini-PC platform</a> that's custom-tailored to the needs of local AI inference and development. Running inference on many of today's state-of-the-art AI models requires far, far more GPU-local memory than even the 32GB that an RTX 5090 can provide. (The RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell offers up to 96GB of GPU-local memory, but that's an $8000+ product before you add in the cost of a host server or workstation).</p><p>The DGX Spark (formerly known as Project DIGITS) includes a unified, coherent pool of 128GB of LPDDR5X memory that's shared between a 20-Arm-core Nvidia Grace CPU and a Blackwell GPU that purports to deliver up to 1 petaFLOP of AI inferencing performance (assuming a model has been reduced to FP4 quantization with sparsity).</p><p>The company says a single DGX Spark supports up to 200-billion-parameter models locally (again assuming FP4 quantization). If one Spark isn't enough, two of these units can be connected using the built-in Nvidia ConnectX 7 NIC to double up on memory and compute resources.</p><p>The DGX Spark runs Nvidia's own DGX OS (a fork of Ubuntu) and supports the all-important CUDA software stack for AI developers. Unlike Strix Halo, which has found a niche as a (costly) gaming chip in devices as diverse as handhelds, the DGX Spark's Arm- and Linux-first nature makes it less appealing as a turn-key gaming platform, though curious enthusiasts can probably get their gaming fix on it with some work.</p><p>Until now, mini-PCs and laptops built around <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-boasts-its-ryzen-ai-max-395-is-up-to-12-2x-faster-than-lunar-lake-in-ai-workloads\" target=\"_blank\">AMD's Ryzen AI Max+ 395 SoC</a> (aka Strix Halo) have had the market of \"relatively reasonably priced chip with a massive memory pool and enough compute for reasonable inferencing performance\" all to themselves. Strix Halo supports up to 112GB of GPU memory (out of a possible 128GB of onboard RAM). But those systems don't natively support the widespread CUDA stack, making for some hurdles for developers and enthusiasts who want to get their AI projects up and running.</p><p>For its part, Nvidia says it's been working with a wide range of software partners to ensure that their tools work well with DGX Spark, including Anaconda, Cadence, ComfyUI, Docker, Google, Hugging Face, JetBrains, LM Studio, Meta, Microsoft, Ollama, and Roboflow, so it seems likely that if you have an LLM you want to run locally, a DGX Spark should be a solid foundation.</p><p>Nvidia originally said DGX Spark systems would start at $3,000 back in January, but at least the first-party DGX Spark will now retail for $3,999. Even at that price, its tiny size, relatively modest 240W power envelope, and complete turn-key support for the CUDA stack are likely to win it a lot of fans in the burgeoning AI space. We’ll have to see whether its long time in the oven has been a liability in a market where everything can still change in the space of hours or days.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/nvidias-dgx-spark-ai-mini-pc-goes-up-for-sale-october-15-1-petaflop-developer-platform-was-originally-slated-for-may</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Nvidia's DGX Spark AI developer platform goes up for sale on October 15.

the 7800X3D</a> showed that it’s already a great CPU for its price. <em>Tom’s Hardware’s</em> benchmarks reveal that it can perform better than some of its pricier competitors from both Intel and AMD, including the newer Intel Core i9-14900K and Core Ultra 9 285K. It comes with eight cores and 16 threads, and it can hit a maximum clock speed of 5.0 GHz. But its most important feature is the 96MB of L3 cache, allowing it to deliver higher frame rates and smoother gameplay. You can see this in our test results, with the 7800X3D consistently hitting an average of 195 FPS across different titles at 1080p Ultra settings, with 1% lows hitting 134 FPS.</p><p>If you’re building a new gaming PC with a mid-range budget or upgrading your current rig, now’s your chance to get a top-of-the-line gaming processor at the price of a mid-ranger. With this, you can either get a better CPU than what you’re aiming for, or you can use the savings to further level up your system by getting one of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\"

in HWMonitor update — release notes specify Core Ultra X, H, and U variants ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The naming scheme for Intel’s recently announced Panther Lake series of mobile processors has been spotted in the release notes for the popular system sensor monitoring tool,<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html\"> </a>by developers CPU ID.<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html\"> </a> According to HWMonitor's release notes for version 1.6, the software now offers support for the upcoming Panther Lake architecture.<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html\" target=\"_blank\"> The notes on the HWMonitor site</a> feature Intel Panther Lake-H and Panther Lake-U processors and list a total of 12 SKUs, including the Core Ultra X9 388H, which will presumably become Intel's next flagship chip. <br><br><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-takes-the-wraps-off-panther-lake-first-18a-client-processor-brings-the-best-of-lunar-lake-and-arrow-lake-together-in-one-package\">Announced last week</a>, Intel’s Panther Lake family of mobile processors mark the company’s first consumer CPUs built on its next-generation 18A process node. The new lineup combines elements from Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake, bringing improved efficiency and performance in a modular, disaggregated design. Panther Lake features Cougar Cove performance cores, Darkmont efficiency cores, and Xe3 integrated graphics with up to 12 Xe cores. <br><br>Intel has developed two 18A compute dies that can be combined with different GPUs and I/O tiles to produce three distinct Panther Lake SoCs designed for different performance levels and price segments. The models listed by HWMonitor are as follows:</p><p><strong>Panther Lake-H (Core Ultra X 300H)</strong></p><p>-Intel Core Ultra X9 388H<br>-Intel Core Ultra X7 368H<br>-Intel Core Ultra X7 358H<br>-Intel Core Ultra X5 338H <br><br><strong>Panther Lake-H (Core Ultra 300H)</strong></p><p>-Intel Core Ultra 9 375H<br>-Intel Core Ultra 7 355H<br>-Intel Core Ultra 7 345H<br>-Intel Core Ultra 5 325H</p><p><strong>Panther Lake-U (Core Ultra 300U)</strong><br><br>-Intel Core Ultra 7 360U<br>-Intel Core Ultra 5 350U<br>-Intel Core Ultra 5 340U<br>-Intel Core Ultra 3 320U</p><p>If we connect the dots, the smallest of the three Panther Lake SoCs could go on to become the Panther Lake-U variant. Based on existing materials released by Intel, this series is set to feature a 4P+4E core configuration similar to Lunar Lake, with 12MB of shared L3 cache and an Xe3 GPU offering up to four Xe cores. It also supports DDR5 SODIMMs or LPCAMM modules up to 6800 MT/s, as well as soldered LPDDR5X memory running at up to 6400 MT/s.</p><p>The mid-size configuration likely corresponds to the Panther Lake-H series, which features a 4P+8E+4LPE core setup, with up to 18MB of shared L3 cache. While it retains the same 4 Xe Core GPU as the smaller variant, the higher core count and larger cache suggest higher performance potential. Additionally, this tier supports DDR5 at speeds up to 7200 MT/s and LPDDR5X at up to 8533 MT/s.</p><p>Lastly, the Core Ultra X-branded Panther Lake-H could correspond to the high-end SoC, which features a similar 4P+8E+4LPE CPU core configuration but with a more powerful 12 Xe3 Core GPU for enhanced graphics performance. Notably, this chip has more limited memory options, which aim to deliver adequate memory bandwidth for the GPU. As per Intel, this tier will support LPDDR5X memory at 9600 MT/s.</p><p>Intel is expected to officially confirm the final SKUs for Panther Lake later this year, with the first wave of products anticipated to ship before the end of 2025, and a broader availability starting next year. However, the early listings offer an early indication of how the lineup could be structured across performance (H-series) and efficiency (U-series) tiers.

When launched, the P1 series sat right between the budget A1 bed slinger and the more deluxe X1 Carbon. With the H2D taking over as Bambu Lab’s high end 3D printer, it’s only fitting that the mid-range machines get a refresh.</p><p>Enter the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://bambulab.com/en-us/p2s\"><u>Bambu Lab P2S Combo</u></a>, a machine that borrows some of the best features from its siblings while remaining an affordable option in four-color printing. It took the color touch screen from the X1 and the swappable nozzle from the A1 – or rather, the H2’s improved versions of the screen and nozzle. It has a better camera, a USB port, an upgraded cooling system, AI camera monitoring to prevent spaghetti monsters, and it comes standard with the new AMS 2 Pro.</p><p>Like the P1S, it has everything you need while leaving some of the high end perks on the table. This printer still has the traditional Bambu Lab 256 mm cubed build volume, but has no lasers, no dual nozzles, no fancy air flaps, and definitely no LiDAR. And best of all, it doesn’t need any of that.</p><p>At the time of this review, the P2S retails at $549 for the standalone machine and $799 for a combo, only $50 more than its predecessor. It's nearly half the price of the H2S and less than a quarter the cost of a fully loaded H2D.</p><p>The P2S maintains Bambu Lab’s exceptional level of speed, quality, and ease of use, making it one of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-3d-printers\"><u>best 3D printers</u></a> we’ve seen this year.</p><h2 id=\"specifications-bambu-lab-p2s-2\">Specifications: Bambu Lab P2S</h2><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Build Volume</strong></p></td><td  ><p>256 x 256 x 256 mm (10 x 10 x 10 inches)</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Material</strong></p></td><td  ><p>PLA/TPU/ABS/PC (up to 300 degrees)</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Extruder Type</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Direct drive</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Nozzle</strong></p></td><td  ><p>.4mm hardened steel</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Build Platform</strong></p></td><td  ><p>PEI textured spring steel sheet, heated</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Bed Leveling</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Automatic</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Filament Runout Sensor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Connectivity</strong></p></td><td  ><p>USB, WiFi, Bluetooth</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Interface</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5 inch Touchscreen</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Machine Footprint</strong></p></td><td  ><p>392*406*478 mm (15.4 x 15.9 x 18.8 inches)</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Machine Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>14.9 KG (32.8 lbs)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=\"bambu-lab-p2s-included-in-the-box-2\">Bambu Lab P2S: Included in the Box</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"MqzTA2m7rMnJ9WpkWPZZee\" name=\"image16\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MqzTA2m7rMnJ9WpkWPZZee.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bambu Lab P2S comes with everything you need to get your printer set up, as well as a few extra parts. You get tools to maintain the printer, spare nozzle wiping pads, and a .5KG full full-sized (refillable) spool of white PLA.</p><p>The printer comes with test models loaded in its memory, including a scraper that you can print and assemble with parts provided in the toolbox. It does NOT come with a USB stick, which you will need to take time-lapse videos. There’s a paper getting-started guide and instructions on how to access the slicer and phone app. The box has a QR code printed on the inside flap that leads to an unpacking video.</p><h2 id=\"design-of-the-bambu-lab-p2s-2\">Design of the Bambu Lab P2S</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"LyXHgNZmeEMp25gKZ5tbee\" name=\"image23\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyXHgNZmeEMp25gKZ5tbee.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious improvement to the P2S is the touch screen, which is the same as the high end H2 series. The previous machine had a barely functional D-Pad LCD screen that drove its users nuts and made the P1 feel cheap.</p><p>The tool head also takes a page from the H2 series and uses the same steel-tipped A1-but-not-an-A1 nozzle. Confused? Me too. The new nozzle looks similar to the removable A1 nozzle and is held on with the same buckle and magnet system. The P2 and H2 nozzles have higher flow rates to match their faster Core XY machines. Bambu says you can use the new nozzle in the A1, but doesn’t recommend putting an A1 nozzle in an H2 (and I assume P2). I wouldn't be surprised if Bambu phases out the old A1 nozzle for more efficient stocking. Either way, I’m happy to see this style in the P2S, as it is way easier to remove for troubleshooting or just swapping sizes.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"dDJERdNNZ9iiFuUdNW3Hfe\" name=\"image4\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dDJERdNNZ9iiFuUdNW3Hfe.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The P2S also gets a new Active Airflow system, which solves one of my personal pet peeves: leaving the door open while printing PLA. Many new users think the door is there to keep children/cats/dust out of the printer, rather than provide a controlled environment for high-temperature printing. The airflow system feeds cooler air from the room to the auxiliary cooling fan on the sidewall. During testing, the chamber temperature hovered around 33C and I had no issue with nozzle clogs or overhangs.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1192px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.29%;\"><img id=\"EZYbwhsZABGU8PaRuKf8be\" name=\"image18\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EZYbwhsZABGU8PaRuKf8be.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1192\" height=\"671\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Bambu Lab)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The printer does not have active heating. But instead, it relies on the bed heater to do all the work. It makes this easier by shutting down internal flaps and only pushing air out of the chamber through a carbon filter. I was able to run ABS without issue.</p><p>The P2S also gets a new USB port, which is one of those little things that really means a lot. Having a USB port allows you to easily transfer files without going through the internet, something the older micro SD card made challenging. It's also where the P2S stores timelapse footage.</p><p>The camera has also been upgraded to a 1080 high frame rate model, and when combined with enhanced chamber lighting, it delivers much better results. The camera is also part of a new AI computer monitoring system that makes sure you have the same plate installed as the slicer settings and watches for nozzle blobs and spaghetti printing.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:880px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:68.07%;\"><img id=\"ZY6kQCTgzFi7gyYHQR8zme\" name=\"image21\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZY6kQCTgzFi7gyYHQR8zme.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"599\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nozzle pressure is measured with an eddy current sensor, and the machine automatically adjusts the flow rates for you. Flow rate is also backed up by the new extruder system, with a PMSM servo delivering 8.5 kg max of extrusion force. That’s about 70% more than the old system. The printer also monitors the system to detect filament grinding or clogs. Combined with a tangle sensor in the filament hub, the P2S is well-equipped to keep printer failures at bay.</p><p>Another small, but important improvement is the removal of the dead zone in the forward left corner. The older machines reserved this space for a permanently mounted prong to push the cutter. Now the machine deploys a foldable prong from the side of the frame.</p><p>And the much maligned carbon fiber rods for the X gantry are gone, replaced with a more easy to clean steel.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"knqVe74bTFQPP8rupNSVfe\" name=\"image1\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/knqVe74bTFQPP8rupNSVfe.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the printer is largely the same: a 256 mm cubed build volume and a speedy, highly accurate motion system. In case this is your first Core XY, the motion system uses a combination of belts to move the X and Y axes in tandem for smoother, faster printing. The print head stays at the top of the machine while the build plate slowly lowers. When combined with vibration-damping input shaping, the results are exceptionally smooth, high-quality prints.</p><p>The printer’s highly sensitive auto bed leveling system makes for a perfect first layer. There is no need to adjust the Z height. After a few minutes of auto calibration, the printer just works.</p><p>The P2S Combo comes standard with the new AMS 2 Pro, a four-color Automatic Material System. This new AMS can double as a filament dryer with active venting to maintain low humidity when the lid is kept closed. It still needs desiccant packs to keep moisture at bay because the dryer doesn’t run while it prints.</p><p>The AMS 2 Pro is now easier to maintain with the tubes exposed. This makes it a lot easier to fish out scraps of filament that might snap inside the unit.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"JtWLVib9hvWHWL4rAtRtee\" name=\"image7\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtWLVib9hvWHWL4rAtRtee.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like all the other Bambu Lab machines, P2S needs a collection bucket for its inevitable pile of filament poops. There are various community-designed solutions to the problem, or you can just put an empty filament box at the back of the machine. I do wish Bambu would address this issue.</p><p>Bambu Lab says the P2S can obtain a top speed of 600mm/s and 20,000 mm/s acceleration, which is still twice the default speed of the slicer. We still have “sport” and “ludicrous” speed modes, which are 124% and 164% faster than normal, but with somewhat sketchy quality results. It’s fine for a quick draft, but I’d still stick with standard speed.</p><p>When the P2S has an error, the touch screen can show us the same helpful assistant as the higher-end machines. It will provide a QR code you can scan with your phone, offering troubleshooting advice from the Bambu Wiki, a knowledge base for operating any Bambu printer. The Wiki will help you identify and fix the problem, often with quick video tutorials.</p><h2 id=\"bambu-lab-automatic-material-system-ams-2\">Bambu Lab Automatic Material System (AMS)</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"X9K96KNd6NhcLC9KNSYMee\" name=\"image2\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X9K96KNd6NhcLC9KNSYMee.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The P2S comes standard with Bambu Lab’s new AMS2 Pro system – a four-spool feeder that unlocks the ability to print in four, eight, twelve, and even sixteen colors. Each unit costs $359 and can be placed on top of or next to the printer. It can still use an older AMS if you have extra or just want to save a couple of bucks.</p><p>The new screen (love that screen) lets you program filament colors while standing next to the printer, and also lets you change the colors or spool placement on sliced files.</p><p>The AMS unit can read RFID ID tags that the company installs on each roll of its own filament for easy identification. These tags tell the printer what type and color of material you have installed, and then match it with presets in Bambu Studio. If you use 3rd party filament, you’ll have to fill that information in by hand.</p><p>The AMS has pockets for descant and seals tightly, allowing you to use the AMS as a drybox for temperamental filament like Nylon. The AMS 2 Pro does double duty as a filament dryer, though only while it is not printing.</p><p>There’s also a “backup” option for the AMS, which will allow it to automatically switch from one slot to the next instead of tripping a run-out sensor. This could be handy for using up partial spools or prints that will need more than one spool. To use this setting, you’ll need to have identical spools loaded.</p><h2 id=\"assembling-the-bambu-lab-p2s-2\">Assembling the Bambu Lab P2S</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"CNxyBbHaEStcpUZ9i8mdee\" name=\"image9\" alt=\"Bambu Lab P2S\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNxyBbHaEStcpUZ9i8mdee.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Bambu Lab P2S comes mostly assembled and only needs to be unpacked.

You’re supposed to take the lid off and run TPU without the Bowden tube directly into the extruder. I didn’t feel like taking the lid off, so I got out a spare spool holder and ran it through the entry point on the right side of the machine (the yellow part). This avoided about half the Bowden tube, but still used the tubes inside the printer. It worked fine. The eternal spool provided by Bambu was on the wrong side of the printer for this set up to work, but in their defense, filament is meant to go through the tangle sensor located in the buffer.</p><p>The purse took 6 hours and 46 minutes to run, using a .8mm nozzle with a .2mm layer height, 4 walls and otherwise standard TPU settings.

But Western Digital has been shipping 11-platter drives in 32TB (SMR) and 26TB (CMR) </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://blog.westerndigital.com/innovating-to-11-western-digital-increases-hdd-capacity-not-size/\"><em>since 2024</em></a><em>.</em><br><br>Toshiba has announced that it is the first company in the hard disk storage space to “verify 12-disk stacking technology.” Rivals currently aren’t able to squeeze more than 10 or 11 platters in their 3.5-inch HDDs. Thanks to this latest innovation, Toshiba expects to be able to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.toshiba.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Toshiba-First-in-Industry-to-Verify-12-Disk-Stacking-Technology-for-Hard-Drives/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">commercialize 40TB HDDs</a> for data centers as early as 2027.</p><h2 id=\"turn-it-up-to-11-this-one-goes-to-12-2\">Turn it up to 11? This one goes to 12.</h2><p>How did Toshiba manage to add 20% more platters to the confines of a standard 3.5-inch form factor drive? The answer is, of course, through miniaturization. More specifically, the squishing of platters required “the development of new dedicated parts in the stack, and replacement of the current aluminum substrate medium with a glass substrate that offers greater durability and allows thinner designs.” Furthermore, Toshiba promises “improved mechanical stability and in-plane accuracy, higher density and greater reliability,” with its advanced design.</p><h2 id=\"safe-from-hamr-2\">Safe from HAMR?</h2><p>Toshiba is going to support the new 12-disk stacking technology devices with its Microwave-Assisted Magnetic Recording (<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/toshiba-demonstrates-30tb-hdds-using-hamr-and-mamr-technologies-customer-sampling-scheduled-for-2025\">MAMR</a>) technology for the headlining 40TB HDDs, sometime in 2027. However, it is also investigating devices using next-generation Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording (<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/seagate-demonstrates-3d-magnetic-recording-for-120-tb-hdds-dual-layer-media-stacks-data-bits-in-hamr-drives\">HAMR</a>) technology. This could be important, as its MAMR roadmap has been relatively conservative compared to rivals already on the HAMR train.</p><p>Some competitors, like Seagate, have roadmaps with 100TB+ HAMR drives (from 2030). WD is also plowing forward with HAMR, but Seagate seems to have leveraged its Invetac acquisition to put it ahead.</p><p>In summary, the 12-platter stacking breakthrough is an important engineering milestone for Toshiba. It will help prevent it from trailing too far behind rivals. Beyond capacities, Toshiba’s work is claimed to deliver “greater durability,” and that could also resonate with data center storage buyers and their TCO and reliability-focused decision-making.</p><h2 id=\"more-details-friday-2\">More details Friday</h2><p>Toshiba will be showcasing its new 12-disk stacking technology at the IDEMA Symposium on October 17, 2025, in Kawasaki, Japan.

Its multi-core performance was better, reaching 16,850 points and surpassing the HP’s 14,838. The Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch was in a league of its own, with the M4 Pro producing a score of 3,910 in single-core and a commanding 22,822 in multi-core.</p><p>The Dell 16 Premium underperformed in our 25GB file transfer test, averaging just 1,079.96 MBps. In contrast, the HP OmniBook Ultra reached 1,780.23 MBps, while the MacBook Pro 16-inch remained out of reach, delivering 2,237.5 MBps, more than twice the Dell’s throughput.</p><p>In our Handbrake test, the Dell 16 Premium completed the 4K-to-1080p transcode in 3 minutes and 50 seconds, decisively ahead of the XPS 16 (4:42) and HP OmniBook Ultra (4:18). Still, it couldn’t touch the MacBook Pro 16-inch, which finished in 2 minutes and 38 seconds.</p><p>We stress-tested the 16 Premium with 10 consecutive runs of Cinebench 2024. During the test, scores ranged between 980.7 and 1,011.75 points, indicating stable thermal performance.</p><h2 id=\"display-on-the-dell-16-premium-2\">Display on the Dell 16 Premium</h2><p>The base configuration of the 16 Premium features a 16.3-inch non-touch IPS panel with a 1920 x 1200 resolution. Our review unit upgrades to an <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/oled-definition,5752.html\"><u>OLED</u></a> display, offering a sharper 3840 x 2400 resolution, touch functionality, and a dynamic refresh rate ranging from 48 to 120 Hz.</p><p>The picture quality is nothing short of captivating. While watching <em>Planet Earth III</em>, I could discern subtle details in shadowed night scenes and was struck by the HDR brilliance of sunlight piercing through jungle foliage. The 120 Hz refresh rate lends a silky smoothness to everyday interactions, whether dragging windows or scrolling content. Touch responsiveness is excellent, and the hinge provides enough resistance to minimize wobble during use. The only drawback is the glossy glass surface, which tends to attract fingerprints and dust.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1103px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:69.99%;\"><img id=\"3iAwmwcMtwiWH34v63xEBG\" name=\"display\" alt=\"Dell 16 Premium (DA16250)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3iAwmwcMtwiWH34v63xEBG.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1103\" height=\"772\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These laptops deliver strong color coverage, with the Dell 16 Premium reaching 79.5% of the DCI-P3 gamut and 112.2% of sRGB, putting it within a couple percentage points of its peers.

The most divisive is the replacement of the traditional top-row function keys with a capacitive touch bar. Each “key” responds instantly to touch, though it lacks haptic feedback. By default, the bar displays media and system controls, such as volume, brightness, and the like, and supports Fn-Lock via the Fn + Esc shortcut to make F1 through F12 primary. As someone that relies on keyboard shortcuts whenever possible, such as Alt + F4 to close a window, I found this design counterintuitive, as it required me to look down each time I wanted to hit an F key.</p><p>Dell’s zero-lattice keyboard design eliminates spacing between keys, which is an aesthetic rather than a functional choice. The keys deliver decent tactile feedback, with an adequate 1 mm of key travel and a gentle cushion at the bottom of each stroke. I clocked 114 words per minute with 99% accuracy on MonkeyType, which is about as quickly as I can go on a laptop. That said, the arrow key cluster’s half-height up and down keys and full-size left and right keys aren’t intuitive. The power button, located adjacent to the backspace key, doubles as a fingerprint reader for biometric login.</p><p>The white keyboard paired with white backlighting is a risky design choice. Under bright lighting, the illuminated typeface can become difficult to make out. Having encountered this issue on previous white XPS models, I was curious to see whether Dell had addressed it. Thankfully, they have. The ambient light sensor now intelligently disables the backlighting in well-lit environments, retaining legibility. Conversely, in low-light settings, the backlighting activates appropriately, ensuring the typeface remains clearly visible.</p><p>As for the touchpad, it’s centered below the keyboard as expected, even though it has no visible border. Initially, I had reservations, but the absence of defined edges didn’t hinder usability. The haptic motors deliver a satisfying tactile bump with each press, and right-clicking proved consistently accurate.</p><h2 id=\"audio-on-the-dell-16-premium-2\">Audio on the Dell 16 Premium</h2><p>For a fairly slim laptop, the 16 Premium delivers first-rate audio. Its quad-speaker setup, consisting of two 3 W woofers and two 2 W tweeters, produces rich, full-bodied sound that matches entry-level Bluetooth speakers. Dubstep tracks from Seven Lions came through with crisp vocals and punchy bass drops, while Steve Winwood’s <em>Valerie</em> showcased the system’s clean instrument separation.</p><p>The one wrinkle in this setup: Dolby Atmos equalizers aren’t enabled out of the box. I had to manually download the Dolby Access app from the Windows Store, which felt like an oversight. While the preset modes didn’t dramatically alter the sound (I stuck with Balanced), they did further improve the already excellent clarity.</p><h2 id=\"upgradeability-of-the-dell-16-premium-2\">Upgradeability of the Dell 16 Premium</h2><p>Accessing the 16 Premium’s internals is straightforward: the bottom panel is secured by eight Torx screws, all conveniently uniform in length. After removing them, the perimeter clips need to be gently disengaged. I used a plastic trim tool for this step, carefully working my way around the edges.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"hA8GoPcVifeKUsmBbcLrRE\" name=\"Dell 16 Premium (DA16250) - Bottom\" alt=\"Dell 16 Premium (DA16250)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hA8GoPcVifeKUsmBbcLrRE.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Options for upgrades and repairs are minimal.

That’s over three hours less than the previous-generation XPS 16 (10:44) and more than five hours behind the HP OmniBook Ultra (12:52). The MacBook Pro 16-inch remained a superstar, clocking an exceptional 21 hours and 1 minute. Clearly, Dell has room to improve its power efficiency.</p><p>Some clue as to what’s going on reside in Dell’s own battery estimates. In their internal testing, OLED-equipped models are rated for just 9 hours of Netflix streaming, compared to 27 hours on the non-OLED variant, a threefold difference. While we couldn’t verify those figures, the takeaway is clear: users prioritizing battery life should avoid the OLED panel.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1071px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:70.68%;\"><img id=\"FsMUTvEEF5a5r83S8hD9BG\" name=\"battery\" alt=\"Dell 16 Premium (DA16250)\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FsMUTvEEF5a5r83S8hD9BG.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1071\" height=\"757\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"heat-on-the-dell-16-premium-2\">Heat on the Dell 16 Premium</h2><p>Thermal management on the 16 Premium is handled by two internal fans, which vent heat through rear exhausts lining the display hinge. The system performs well: during our Cinebench stress loop, surface temperatures peaked at just 78 degrees F on the touchpad, 86 F between the G and H keys, and 93 F on the underside near the exhaust vents. Internally, the Core Ultra 7 255H processor operated at an average temperature of 78 C.</p><p>Throughout testing, the chassis remained comfortable to the touch, and the fans operated quietly, blending into ambient household noise.</p><h2 id=\"webcam-on-the-dell-16-premium-2\">Webcam on the Dell 16 Premium</h2><p>Dell’s webcam offers impressive picture quality. Despite only having a 1920 x 1080 video resolution, the picture is sharp, clear, and almost free of noise even in slightly darker than optimal environments. It also offers an IR sensor for facial recognition, allowing password-less logins using Windows Hello. Alas, Dell missed adding a sliding privacy shutter or an e-shutter, which competitors like HP and Lenovo often offer.</p><h2 id=\"software-and-warranty-on-the-dell-16-premium-2\">Software and Warranty on the Dell 16 Premium</h2><p>Dell preinstalls a few utilities on the 16 Premium, including the My Dell app, which shows system health, warranty info, and access to some settings like Dolby Vision display modes. Users probably won’t need to interact with this app regularly.</p><p>The system also comes with one year of Dell Care Plus, which provides onsite repairs following remote diagnostics. It also includes proactive hardware monitoring via the Support Assist app, which can anticipate component failures and, according to Dell, even initiate automatic part replacements.</p><p>Dell also includes a years’ subscription of McAfee Premium anti-virus, not a trial.</p><p>A one-year warranty is standard, with extended coverage available. Accidental damage coverage is also available via Dell Premium for $89.</p><h2 id=\"dell-16-premium-da16250-configurations-2\">Dell 16 Premium (DA16250) Configurations</h2><p>Dell’s 16 Premium begins at $1,799, equipped with a Core Ultra 7 255H processor, Arc 140T integrated graphics, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The base configuration features a 1920 x 1200 non-touch display with a variable refresh rate of 30–120 Hz and a peak brightness of 500 nits. Our $2,949 review unit steps up to a 4K OLED touchscreen, discrete Nvidia RTX 5070 graphics, and doubled memory and storage (32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD).</p><p>Customizable models offer a Core Ultra 9 285H CPU, up to 64GB of RAM, and storage options reaching 4TB. Graphics upgrades include in-between options of the RTX 5050 and 5060. The laptop is available in Graphite and Platinum finishes.</p><p>Our review unit is priced in line with the Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch featuring the 14-core M4 Pro, which is $2,499 with 24GB of RAM or $2,899 with 48GB. Opting for 1TB of storage pushes the price to $3,499. On the Windows side, Dell faces limited competition. One notable contender we haven’t yet tested is the Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i Aura Edition, listed at $1,899 at the time of writing. It features a Core Ultra 9 285H processor, RTX 5060 GPU, 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and a 3000 × 2000 OLED display.</p><h2 id=\"bottom-line-12\">Bottom Line</h2><p>Dell’s 16 Premium largely delivers on its high-end ambitions. Its forward-looking design impresses with both quality and style, and it offers excellent entertainment potential with its beautiful OLED screen and quad speakers. Performance is also strong, at least among Windows machines, thanks to an Intel Core H-class CPU and quiet, effective cooling.</p><p>However, some design choices detract from usability. The capacitive touch bar, while responsive, lacks the tactile intuitiveness of physical keys, and the absence of USB-A ports limits connectivity. Our most notable complaint is the disappointing battery life of the OLED model.</p><p>Despite the Premium rebrand, this laptop still has all of the promise and compromises of the XPS 16. If you want a futuristic rival to the MacBook Pro, it's an option, but you'll have to handle the trade-offs to get the cool design and performance.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-16-premium-review</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Dell's 16 Premium impresses with a sleek design, OLED screen, and robust performance, but the look also brings compromises. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">Rw9voSy7npNcNhheaKyjnX</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2EPHvst3pWXDwUteR2TSE-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Ultrabooks and Ultraportables]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Laptops]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Charles Jefferies ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2EPHvst3pWXDwUteR2TSE-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tom&#039;s Hardware]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Dell 16 Premium (DA16250)]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Dell 16 Premium (DA16250)]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B2EPHvst3pWXDwUteR2TSE-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ AMD and Intel celebrate first anniversary of x86 alliance — new security features coming to x86 CPUs ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>AMD and Intel are celebrating one year since the formation of the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group, an alliance designed to coordinate the evolution of the x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) and ensure that new features are supported by both leading CPU designers. In the first year, AMD and Intel have managed to ratify four new features that are set to be supported by the upcoming processors from these companies, including long-awaited memory tagging.</p><p>The new cross-vendor capabilities agreed upon by AMD and Intel are ACE (Advanced Matrix Extension) and AVX10 to enhance the performance of matrix multiplication and vector operations, as well as FRED (Flexible Return and Event Delivery) and ChkTag (x86 Memory Tagging) to reduce latency between software and hardware, as well as to detect errors like buffer overflows or use-after free bugs.</p><p>Intel's Granite Rapids processors already support AVX10.1 and AMX, whereas Sapphire Rapids were first to support AMX instructions. With the ratification by the x86 EDA, AVX10 and AMX will be supported by AMD's next-generation processors, though we can only wonder whether this will happen with Zen 6 or already with Zen 7. Other capabilities are less well-known.</p><p>Intel introduced <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/779982/flexible-return-and-event-delivery-fred-specification.html\">FRED publicly in 2023,</a> and by now, the capability is well-documented in developer documentation. The technology is described as a replacement for traditional x86 interrupt and exception mechanisms, so ultimately it is designed to simplify context switches, reduce latency, improve performance, and security when working with operating systems that support it.</p><p>FRED speeds up how the CPU switches between user mode (ring 3) and kernel mode (ring 0) with a hardware-defined entry and exit path. While this does not sound too impressive, replacing the old x86 mechanism (which uses the Interrupt Descriptor Table and IRET) is a big deal. At present, every time an application interacts with the OS (which happens millions of times per second), the CPU must switch between user mode and kernel mode, which introduces fairly high latencies with today's machines. Since the traditional IDT and IRET mechanisms are software-managed, while FRED provides a hardware-defined and verified entry and return path, replacing the former with the latter also improves reliability and security, in addition to performance</p><p>Up until today, AMD's stance on FRED was unclear, but now that the feature is recognized by the x86 EAG as a cross-vendor capability, it will be added to AMD's platforms over time.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting addition to the list of cross-vendor x86 EAG features is the ChkTag (x86 Memory Tagging) capability, which has not been widely discussed before. The feature is added to catch memory safety errors — problems like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and out-of-bounds memory access — directly in hardware. Memory tagging is rapidly becoming a standard feature in modern CPUs as it is valuable (can catch a variety of bugs in hardware) and easy to implement, which is why modern processors from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/\">Apple</a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://amperecomputing.com/blogs/empowering-developers-and-fueling-ai-adoption-with-ampereone\">Ampere</a> now support Arm's <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://developer.arm.com/documentation/109697/0100/Feature-descriptions/The-Armv8-9-architecture-extension?lang=en#md454-the-armv89-architecture-extension__FEAT_MTE4\">MTE</a> technology.</p><p>It is hard to say when AMD and Intel plan to implement ChkTag (x86 Memory Tagging) in their processors. The announcement by the x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group signals both are committed to supporting this feature, but there is no obligation to implement it within a certain timeframe. Meanwhile, hardware changes of this depth typically require building them into the CPU microarchitecture itself, so expect support of FRED and ChkTag to come several years down the road.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/amd-and-intel-celebrate-first-anniversary-of-x86-alliance-new-security-features-coming-to-x86-cpus</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ AMD and Intel marked the first anniversary of their x86 Ecosystem Advisory Group by confirming four jointly standardized features — AVX10, ACE, FRED, and ChkTag — that will unify future x86 processors around shared hardware capabilities. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">nYuQuBf3BZUqqJCrBMxv5T</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bL5iYiBUY2rLX6QTRp4iaU-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 11:45:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[CPUs]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bL5iYiBUY2rLX6QTRp4iaU-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Core ultra 200S CPU]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Core ultra 200S CPU]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bL5iYiBUY2rLX6QTRp4iaU-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Former Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger confirms the industry is in an AI bubble, but that a pop could be several years away — 'We’re displacing all of the internet and the service provider industry as we think about it today' ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Pat Gelsinger says we’re already in an AI bubble, but says it could be several years before anything bad happens. The former Intel CEO was asked during an interview on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzKKMH2S06Y\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CNBC</em></a> if we’re in an AI bubble, stating, “There’s a lot of leverage in the system, there’s a lot of cash, but then there’s a whole bunch of other folks who are trying to build these data centers. Whether there’s the energy component side of it, or whether you think about the real estate component, I mean, there’s just a whole lot of things happening at one time.”</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzKKMH2S06Y\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>“Are we in an AI bubble? Of course, we are. We are hyped, we’re accelerating, we’re putting enormous leverage into the system,” Gelsinger answered. “With that said, I don’t see it ending for several years. I do think we have an industry shift to AI. As Jensen (Huang) talked about, and I agree with this, you know that businesses are yet to really start materially benefiting from [it]. We’re displacing all of the internet and the service provider industry as we think about it today — we have a long way to go.”</p><p>Despite the disruption that AI has put on some industries, Gelsinger believes that we still have quite a way to go before we see the AI bubble burst. Continuing improvements in semiconductor efficiency would allow the industry to go further before running into trouble, the former CEO added, stating some changes will start materializing later in the decade. As such, he believes that nothing could change in the state of play for several years, despite radical improvements to AI he acknowledged had transpired in the last year alone.</p><p>Many experts are starting to get worried about the AI bubble, especially as companies are investing billions into the technology without seeing real returns yet. Even big institutions like the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund are <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/bank-of-england-imf-warn-ai-bubble-risk-has-shades-of-2000-dotcom-crash-goldman-sachs-cautions-were-not-there-yet\">worried about it</a>, saying we’re already halfway into a crash that could <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-bubble-is-worse-than-the-dot-com-crash-that-erased-trillions-economist-warns-overvaluations-could-lead-to-catastrophic-consequences\">erase trillions in value</a>. Still, tech companies continue investing and building massive data centers, like <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/despite-whispers-of-a-bubble-openai-is-planning-a-gigawatt-scale-data-center-in-india\">OpenAI’s planned gigawatt facility in India</a>. These projects aren’t just costing money and energy — they’re also affecting global memory and storage supply, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/perfect-storm-of-demand-and-supply-driving-up-storage-costs\">leading to a price crunch</a> for just about everything that needs them.</p><p>If the AI bubble bursts, a lot of industries will be affected. While those working in the semiconductor and AI space will be hit the hardest, financial institutions would also be gravely affected — especially those that have heavily invested in companies like Nvidia and OpenAI. And while the average person might think they’re safe because they do not own stocks in these companies, their banks, pension funds, and other financial instruments likely are, causing widespread chaos if and when this happens.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/former-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-confirms-the-industry-is-in-an-ai-bubble-but-that-a-pop-could-be-several-years-away-were-displacing-all-of-the-internet-and-the-service-provider-industry-as-we-think-about-it-today</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ The former CEO says that we're in an AI bubble, but technological developments in AI efficiency will prevent it from bursting, at least in the near future. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6TxGQoCE5CWnVSHDhV6ApH</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9eGTbEZZXQ4j4wDBJ22F-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 11:41:21 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Jowi Morales) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jowi Morales ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dp9eGTbEZZXQ4j4wDBJ22F-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Getty / Michael M.

Many Western nations have mirrored this in turn, with the Dutch government's latest actions appearing to be just one more example of nations ensuring their own supply of silicon above almost all else.</p><p>This new paradigm is born from the old one, though, and until the time when economies are truly uncoupled, there is always room for retaliation. Just as the Dutch government severed China's ability to make decisions about the future of Nexperia and its technologies, China can inhibit production and export from Nexperia facilities located within its borders, which it has now done. Nexperia has said it is seeking an exception, but considering the broader political and strategic forces at play, that seems unlikely without other counterbalancing actions being taken.</p><p>Nexperia has multiple facilities around the world, including manufacturing, assembly, and testing facilities in Germany and the UK, but it also maintains an 80,000 square-meter assembly site in Guangdong province, China. It's that location that will be halted from exporting any products in the near future.</p><p>All of this serves as a tertiary backdrop for the heavily anticipated trade negotiations between President Trump and the Chinese Premier, Xi Jinping, which are slated to take place later this month. Although there have been posturing and statements that suggest they may not take place, most of the announcements of trade adjustments and blockades are seen as attempts to strengthen negotiating positions ahead of the talks.</p><p>Alongside the Dutch government seizing Nexperia, CEO Zhang Xuezheng (who founded parent company, Wingtech) has been ousted. Nexperia Chief Financial Officer, Stefan Tilger, is now acting as interim CEO, with court-appointed Dutch businessman Guido Dierick as non-executive director.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/china-retaliates-in-response-to-dutch-seizure-of-nexperia-blocking-chipmakers-exports-following-takeover-861-000-square-foot-assembly-site-in-gaungdong-affected-as-trade-war-spirals</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ In retaliation against the Dutch government seizing control of the Dutch chip company, Nexperia, from its Chinese parent company, China has now blocked Nexperia from exporting products from the Asian-country, raising trade tensions amidst ongoing trade talks with the US. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">C9uBKMAhRjLAYfZ4sv6bM</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6CoG4mtxeyTitsu6xtgxUL-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 11:12:41 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jon Martindale ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6CoG4mtxeyTitsu6xtgxUL-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images/Huw Fairclough]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Nexperia factory in Newport.]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Nexperia factory in Newport.]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6CoG4mtxeyTitsu6xtgxUL-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Chinese victims of convicted 'Bitcoin Queen' may have trouble getting their $7.3 billion back from UK government — lawyers predict a lengthy cross-border ordeal for 130,000 investment scheme victims ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The seizure of $7.3 billion in bitcoin from Chinese \"Bitcoin Queen\" Qian Zhimin by the UK's Metropolitan Police set the record for the largest cryptocurrency seizure ever recorded. However, the 130,000 Chinese victims of Qian's scams may face difficulties attempting to recover their stolen funds from the UK government, claims <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/cryptocurrencies/chinese-crypto-scam-victims-face-uphill-battle-after-record-7bn-seizure\" target=\"_blank\">Nikkei Asia</a>.</p><p>When Qian pled guilty to criminal charges of illegally acquiring and possessing the cryptocurrency in September, the UK government <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/usd7-3-billion-worth-of-cryptocurrency-recovered-from-newly-convicted-bitcoin-queen-funds-from-fraudster-thought-to-be-the-largest-seizure-to-date\">seized all 61,000 bitcoins from the accused con artist</a>. However, due to a variety of messy complications, the hundreds of thousands of victims of Qian's schemes will face an uphill battle in getting their full stolen funds returned to them in China, not least because the UK government may reportedly desire to keep hold of the funds for itself.</p><p>Qian ran a Ponzi scheme from 2014 to 2017 in China, operating a fake wealth management firm promising dividend payouts to investors and customers in the company. Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology, Qian's company, collected over 43 billion yuan ($6 billion) during its three years of activity.</p><p>Qian then fled China on falsified documents, escaping to the United Kingdom seeking \"refuge from persecution by the Chinese authorities\" for the crime of being a successful cryptocurrency businessperson. Of course, Qian was not a bitcoin whale at the time of her escape into the UK; she converted the stolen funds, originally collected in yuan, into bitcoin as part of a massive money laundering effort begun in 2017 with the help of the also convicted Wen Jian.</p><p>\"Since commencing work on the case last year, we have requested clients to prepare their evidence. However, some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection,\" says Jack Ding, partner at Duan & Duan, a Beijing-based legal firm representing a large number of victims of the heist.</p><h2 id=\"legal-struggles-and-mounting-challenges-2\">Legal Struggles and Mounting Challenges</h2><p>The money laundering aspect of the theft has made returning stolen funds to victims a struggle for lawyers. \"It remains challenging to demonstrate that funds transferred from one victim to another bank account were, in fact, under the control of Tianjin Lantian Gerui, and tracing such funds to bitcoin held by U.K. authorities has proven not very easy,\" Ding said.</p><p>Beyond tracing the paper trails proving the reclaimed bitcoins were originally yuan held by Chinese victims, returning stolen funds is a challenge of its own. \"Any liquidation of the seized bitcoins would have to go through licensed intermediaries. Monetizing such a vast amount of bitcoins while preserving value is no simple task; it could take years,\" said Yang Yuhua, a lawyer at Thornhill Legal, also representing many of the victims.</p><p>Collecting the information of the victims to ensure restitution is also a difficult task for lawyers. According to Ding, most victims are individuals who \"may have limited experience with computers or completing required forms. Effective communications are challenging, as a significant portion of this group has not received formal education.\"</p><p>And of course, the entirety of the $7.3 billion crypto seizure will likely not return to China even if all affected parties are able to be contacted. Ding shared that the United Kingdom may attempt to keep the majority of the bitcoins within the government's coffers. As the original principal investments of defrauded clients in China are estimated at £640 million ($850 million), much less than the incredible $7.3 billion crypto sum, legal loopholes would enable UK lawyers and judges to return a very low dollar amount to affected persons.</p><p>According to Yang, while lawyers may argue that clients are entitled to their personal share of the massive current-day investment based on the appreciation of bitcoin's value, precedent dictates that courts will focus on \"restitution of the principal, and possibly reasonable interest, rather than any speculative or market-driven gains.\" The nearly 10x return on investment, possible largely via the growth in value of bitcoin over the last eight years, is not likely to make its way across the Eurasian continent back into the pockets of defrauded Chinese individuals.</p><p>The sentencing of Qian Zhimin is expected around November 10.

On Monday, the popular drone maker told <em>Tom’s Hardware</em> it is going to appeal against the decision, which upheld its designation as a “Chinese Military Company” by the U.S. government. The decision by DJI isn’t a surprise, as it seeks to defend its place in one of the most lucrative markets it has developed.</p><p>This decision to appeal is just the latest chapter in a tug-of-war between DJI and the U.S. Department of Defense (recently rebranded to the Department of War). The crux of the issue is that the U.S. authorities believe that DJI is owned or controlled by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and has Chinese military links. DJI strongly denies it has any such connection(s).</p><p>“DJI, the global leader in civilian drones and creative camera technology, today announced that it has filed an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit following the ruling of the District of Columbia District Court in DJI v. U.S. Department of Defense,” DJI said. “While the Court upheld the Department of Defense’s (DoD) designation of DJI as a ‘Chinese Military Company,’ it also made several critical findings that reaffirm DJI’s long-held position that it is not owned by, controlled by, or otherwise affiliated with the Chinese government or military.”</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"VaAC9e5oeKohRSaFxAFD58\" name=\"dji-hero2\" alt=\"DJI drones\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VaAC9e5oeKohRSaFxAFD58.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: DJI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>DJI reiterated that the court had rejected all but two of the DoD’s allegations.

This isn’t indicative of any Chinese military use of or affiliation, asserts DJI.</p><p>A DJI spokesperson added that the firm respects the court’s process, but was disappointed by the ruling. It is also highlighted that DJI was the first drone company to “publicly denounce and actively discourage combat use of its products, and it has never manufactured military equipment nor marketed drones for combat.”</p><h2 id=\"audit-concerns-2\">Audit concerns</h2><p>DJI’s drone and camera products weren’t banned for sale/distribution by the last ruling.

The company says the collaboration will power future gigawatt-scale data centers thanks to its high-efficiency infrastructure.</p><p>In case you haven't dipped your toes in the data center world, moving to 800V DC transmission is quite a big deal, as it allows for significant efficiency improvements, large cost savings in materials needed, and much higher upper limits on per-rack and per-data center power delivery. While the 800 VDC notion isn't new, having the world's largest chip designer fully embrace the standard throws substantial weight behind it.</p><p>The announcement notes that Nvidia is gunning for <strong>mega</strong>watt-powered individual server racks, with many of these making up <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/openai-and-amd-announce-multibillion-dollar-partnership-amd-to-supply-6-gigawatts-in-chips-openai-could-get-up-to-10-percent-of-amd-shares-in-return\">all those gigawatts we keep hearing about</a> in recent AI deals. ABB claims it's on the leading edge of producing 800 VDC gear for \"next-generation\" AI data centers.</p><p>As a practical example, Nvidia cites marine vessels' 1,000 VDC systems as saving 20 to 40% energy and having 30% lower maintenance costs. That presumably adds to the lower material cost of installation. The company further notes that future data centers combine medium-voltage power supplies with DC power distribution, all with solid-state power electronics devices. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://new.abb.com/news/detail/129788/redefining-power-infrastructure-for-ai-the-role-of-800-vdc-in-data-centers\" target=\"_blank\">Both ABB</a> and Nvidia have <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-800-v-hvdc-architecture-will-power-the-next-generation-of-ai-factories/\" target=\"_blank\">detailed write-ups</a> on 800 VDC, but here's a simplification.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:33.69%;\"><img id=\"sMcQjSPSWVrGU3frX3LLC6\" name=\"Standard AC datacenter power delivery vs 800 VDC\" alt=\"Standard AC datacenter power delivery vs 800 VDC\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sMcQjSPSWVrGU3frX3LLC6.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"539\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Standard AC datacenter power delivery vs 800 VDC </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nvidia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using a common PC as a basic example, electricity gets to your power supply in 110 V (or 220V) AC form, then gets converted to DC by said power supply to 12 V, 5 V, and 3.3 V. The conversion introduces a certain amount of loss, exacerbated many times over in a data center scenario. A good number of contemporary data center installations use medium voltage 340-480 V three-phase for the main line and across the building, and step down to DC at the PSUs and UPSes.</p><p>That's already more complicated than it needs to be. Even at the increased voltage of a data center, basic physics demands that in order to carry the hundreds of kilowatts that modern server racks can require, it's necessary to use extremely thick cables along with corresponding connectors and associated gear.</p><p>The equipment required for the multiple step-downs is likewise bulky and repeated, so to speak, in multiple steps along the way. All this is quite pricey and demands careful consideration when architecting data center buildings.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:33.56%;\"><img id=\"qbxPnUCmaaF42c8YLsyag9\" name=\"800 VDC datacenter power delivery\" alt=\"800 VDC data center power delivery\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qbxPnUCmaaF42c8YLsyag9.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"537\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nvidia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Increasing the voltage to 800 V by itself already substantially knocks down the wire gauges necessary, and converting to DC immediately at the power room completely bypasses any further equipment up to the rack, with only current protection as a key element along the path. The rack equipment then takes care of stepping 800 V DC down to 12 V DC, bypassing the majority of components in a regular PSU. It's a win-win scenario for everyone involved.</p><p>While historically medium- and high-voltage lines have been AC to avoid transmission losses, material advancements have made long-range DC transmission more popular, like in the recently started 525 kV DC cable that will be <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.nexans.com/press-releases/nexans-wins-record-breaking-contract-for-the-euroasia-interconnector/\">running across the Mediterranean Sea floor</a>.

In a bit of irony, the developers behind Windows-alternative ReactOS are finally working on introducing the Windows Display Driver Model (WDDM) to the Windows OS alternative as Windows 10 reaches end-of-life. ReactOS dev <em>The_DarkFire_</em> posted a lengthy <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://reactos.org/blogs/investigating-wddm/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post,</a> discussing the complications of starting the development of implementing WDDM into ReactOS.</p><p>The_DarkFire_ reveals that implementing WDDM into ReactOS has been difficult, due to a lack of video driver documentation for both XDDM and WDDM. However, things changed once open-source GPU drivers began cropping up over the past few years. The introduction of these drivers in the wild has finally given ReactOS devs a better understanding of how these display models operate and a potential way to get WDDM into ReactOS.</p><p>It turns out that WDDM relies heavily on the design philosophy behind XDDM to the point where having a solid XDDM base is necessary to support WDDM well. The_DarkFire_ reports that the only thing that has really changed between the two models is the discontinuation of the miniport driver on WDDM.  \"Outside of the miniport driver, modern Windows still has XDDM remnants all over the place, including mechanisms for WDDM.\"</p><p>To get WDDM into ReactOS, the developer notes that its XDDM stack \"must be in great shape,\" as previously mentioned. Additionally, compiling WDDM drivers for ReactOS was necessary, which was reportedly very straightforward.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:787px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:75.86%;\"><img id=\"L2yVpiGAJruSipKR5hT2cC\" name=\"ReactOS\" alt=\"ReactOS\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L2yVpiGAJruSipKR5hT2cC.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"787\" height=\"597\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: reactos.org)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The ReactOS dev showed an experimental implementation of WDDM working in ReactOS using a basic display adapter. Not only did it work, but the dev also tried a variety of other vendor-specific GPU drivers, including an Nvidia Windows 7 GPU driver, and discovered they all were providing display out functionality on ReactOS. Best of all, these drivers were capable of driving modern monitors at their full resolution and refresh rates.</p><p>XDDM and WDDM are display driver models that define how Windows talks to the GPU. XDDM is a legacy driver model that was used during the Windows XP era. WDDM is the successor to that model, which was introduced with Windows Vista, and has been used ever since.</p><p>Moving to WDDM will be important for ReactOS, since it is the default driver model used by all modern Windows operating systems. GPU drivers, as a result, are also written to support WDDM, so getting these drivers to work in ReactOS will be very beneficial in making the Windows OS alternative work on newer GPU hardware. WDDM also supports a variety of modern features XDDM simply doesn't, including the DWM, virtual GPU memory, and user mode functionality (the latter prevents the GPU driver from crashing the entire system if it crashes itself).</p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/open-source-windows-project-working-to-integrate-directx-support\">ReactOS</a> is an open-source project that is capable of running Windows software, can run Windows drivers, and looks similar to outgoing iterations of Windows (usually older versions like Windows XP). The project is written completely from scratch, and not based on Linux or Unix, making it a truly unique open-source operating system.</p><p>We wouldn't recommend you replace Windows 10 with ReactOS as your daily driver since the project is very much an experimental project, and doesn't have many of the modern features that Windows has. But it is a cool project regardless, and is pretty much the only open-source OS that can natively run Windows apps without compatibility layers.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/as-windows-10-signs-off-reactos-devs-are-exploring-a-long-awaited-feature-in-wddm-support-investigation-could-pave-the-way-for-newer-gpu-hardware-compatibility</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ ReactOS developers are now working on implementing the Windows Display Driver Model in the Windows OS alternative, as Windows 10 reaches end-of-life. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">gwoMpyQ5aEQZ83qbdpi9uL</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnDSN7UqmUThesPVu6zigC-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 09:49:39 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Windows]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Software]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Operating Systems]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Aaron Klotz) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Aaron Klotz ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnDSN7UqmUThesPVu6zigC-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[reactos.org]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[ReactOS]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[ReactOS]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QnDSN7UqmUThesPVu6zigC-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Windows 10 support ends today — here's who's affected and what you need to do ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As of October 14, Windows 10 is no longer supported by Microsoft. That means no more feature updates, no more official troubleshooting support, and most importantly, no more security updates. Any zero-day exploits hackers have been sitting on are almost certainly now out in the wild, and there's not much Microsoft is going to do to stop them.</p><p>If you're still running Windows 10, it's <strong>really important</strong> you take steps to protect yourself as soon as possible. Your operating system is almost certainly far less secure than it was at the start of October 2025.</p><h2 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-windows-10-support-is-ending-who-is-affected\"><span>Windows 10 support is ending: Who is affected?</span></h2><p>If you're running Windows 10, you're affected. Windows 10 has officially reached End of Life (EOL) status, so it is no longer supported in almost any way (see below). Whether you have Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Pro, a commercial or educational license, run a business, or anything else besides. If it's Windows 10, it's done; <strong>Your system is not secure</strong>.</p><p>This doesn't mean Windows 10 will stop working, but without the necessary updates to prevent hackers and bugs from breaking things, the operating system will be exceedingly vulnerable. Hackers and malware authors often sit on potential bugs and hacks so that they can be utilized at the most opportune time. The end of support for a piece of an operating system is a perfect opportunity.</p><p>The real kicker? If something goes wrong (or you suffer a malware attack), there's no one at the end of an official support line who can help you, as Microsoft is canning Windows 10 troubleshooting support too.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-windows-10-support-is-ending-why-is-windows-10-losing-support\"><span>Windows 10 support is ending: Why is Windows 10 losing support?</span></h3><p>This happens to every version of Windows eventually, and it's just Windows 10's time. It was released in 2015, so it has had a 10-year run, which is roughly comparable to other standout Microsoft operating systems like Windows 7. There are only so many years Microsoft is willing to provide support for older systems, and it has commercial reasons to encourage users to move to newer platforms, too.</p><p>Microsoft <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-will-end-windows-10-support-in-exactly-one-year\">announced the impending end of Windows 10's support in October 2024</a>, giving everyone a year's head start on their update or upgrade.

This is a scheme that will give up to a year of additional security updates (though not feature updates or official troubleshooting support), culminating on October 13, 2026, no matter when you take it out. (So the sooner the better)</p><p>To take advantage of the ESU scheme, you'll need a Windows 10 system running version 22H2, Home, Professional, Pro Education, or Workstations edition. Commercial Windows 10 installations are subject to a different ESU programme. You'll also need to have all the latest Windows updates installed and use an adult Microsoft account to sign in as an administrator.</p><p>There are three ways to join the ESU programme:</p><ul><li>Pay a one-time $30 purchase fee.</li><li>Redeem 1,000 Microsoft Rewards points.</li><li>For free, if:<ul><li>You are located in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area\" target=\"_blank\">European Economic Area</a> and log in to a Microsoft account.</li><li>Log in to a Microsoft account and <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/back-up-and-restore-with-windows-backup-87a81f8a-78fa-456e-b521-ac0560e32338#id0ebh=windows_10\" target=\"_blank\">use Windows Backup</a> to sync your files.</li></ul></li></ul><p>You can enroll in the ESU at any time throughout the next year, but it will still end for consumers on October 13, 2026. Also, you will remain vulnerable when running Windows 10 anytime before you join the ESU.</p><p>To join the ESU, on your Windows 10 system, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Update and Security</strong> > <strong>Windows Update</strong>. As long as your device meets the prerequisites for the scheme, you'll see a link there to enroll. Select it.</p><p>You'll be prompted on how you want to enroll, whether that's paying the fee, backing up, or signing into a Microsoft account. Select your preferred option and follow the on-screen instructions.</p><p>The ESU can be used across 10 devices once you've joined it. On any additional devices you want to use it on, navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Update & Security</strong> > <strong>Windows Update</strong> and select <strong>Enroll Now</strong> on those additional devices.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"UE7CsF47XGCbZuf8PENCeT\" name=\"howtoenroll\" alt=\"Microsoft Windows 10 How to enroll in ESU window.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UE7CsF47XGCbZuf8PENCeT.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Microsoft)</span></figcaption></figure><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-air-gap-your-system\"><span>Air gap your system</span></h3><p>The final option to secure your Windows 10 system is just to make it so that it can't be attacked or infected.

The round, led by <a href=\"https://www.bvp.com/\"><u>Bessemer Venture Partners</u></a> with participation from <a href=\"https://www.decibel.vc/\"><u>Decibel Partners</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/strategy/future-back-ventures/\"><u>Bain Future Back Ventures</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.mvp-vc.com/\"><u>MVP Ventures</u></a> and <a href=\"https://645ventures.com/\"><u>645 Ventures</u></a>, comes as enterprises increasingly turn to artificial intelligence to understand customers faster and more deeply than traditional methods allow.</p><p>The investment marks a sharp acceleration for the startup founded by Lydia Hylton and Priya Krishnan, two former consultants and product managers who watched companies struggle with a customer research process that could take eight weeks from start to finish. Since October, Strella has grown revenue tenfold, quadrupled its customer base to more than 40 paying enterprises, and tripled its average contract values by moving upmarket to serve Fortune 500 companies.</p><p>&quot;Research tends to be bookended by two very strategic steps: first, we have a problem—what research should we do? And second, we&#x27;ve done the research—now what are we going to do with it?&quot; said Hylton, Strella&#x27;s CEO, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;All the stuff in the middle tends to be execution and lower-skill work. We view Strella as doing that middle 90% of the work.&quot;</p><p>The platform now serves <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\"><u>Amazon</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.duolingo.com/\"><u>Duolingo</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.apollographql.com/\"><u>Apollo GraphQL</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.chobani.com/\"><u>Chobani</u></a>, collectively conducting thousands of AI-moderated interviews that deliver what the company claims is a 90% average time savings on manual research work. The company is approaching $1 million in revenue after beginning monetization only in January, with month-over-month growth of 50% and zero customer churn to date.</p><h2><b>How AI-powered interviews compress eight-week research projects into days</b></h2><p>Strella&#x27;s technology addresses a workflow that has frustrated product teams, marketers, and designers for decades. Traditional customer research requires writing interview guides, recruiting participants, scheduling calls, conducting interviews, taking notes, synthesizing findings, and creating presentations — a process that consumes weeks of highly-skilled labor and often delays critical product decisions.</p><p>The platform compresses that timeline to days by using AI to moderate voice-based interviews that run like Zoom calls, but with an artificial intelligence agent asking questions, following up on interesting responses, and detecting when participants are being evasive or fraudulent. The system then synthesizes findings automatically, creating highlight reels and charts from unstructured qualitative data.</p><p>&quot;It used to take eight weeks. Now you can do it in the span of a couple days,&quot; Hylton told VentureBeat. &quot;The primary technology is through an AI-moderated interview. It&#x27;s like being in a Zoom call with an AI instead of a human — it&#x27;s completely free form and voice based.&quot;</p><p>Critically, the platform also supports human moderators joining the same calls, reflecting the founders&#x27; belief that humans won&#x27;t disappear from the research process. &quot;Human moderation won&#x27;t go away, which is why we&#x27;ve supported human moderation from our Genesis,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;Research tends to be bookended by two very strategic steps: we have a problem, what&#x27;s the research that we should do? And we&#x27;ve done the research, now what are we going to do with it? All the stuff in the middle tends to be execution and lower skill work. We view Strella as doing that middle 90% of the work.&quot;</p><h2><b>Why customers tell AI moderators the truth they won&#x27;t share with humans</b></h2><p>One of Strella&#x27;s most surprising findings challenges assumptions about AI in qualitative research: participants appear more honest with AI moderators than with humans. The founders discovered this pattern repeatedly as customers ran head-to-head comparisons between traditional human-moderated studies and Strella&#x27;s AI approach.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re a designer and you get on a Zoom call with a customer and you say, &#x27;Do you like my design?&#x27; they&#x27;re always gonna say yes. They don&#x27;t want to hurt your feelings,&quot; Hylton explained. &quot;But it&#x27;s not a problem at all for Strella. They would tell you exactly what they think about it, which is really valuable. It&#x27;s very hard to get honest feedback.&quot;</p><p>Krishnan, Strella&#x27;s COO, said companies initially worried about using AI and &quot;eroding quality,&quot; but the platform has &quot;actually found the opposite to be true. People are much more open and honest with an AI moderator, and so the level of insight that you get is much richer because people are giving their unfiltered feedback.&quot;</p><p>This dynamic has practical business implications. Brian Santiago, Senior Product Design Manager at Apollo GraphQL, said in a statement: &quot;Before Strella, studies took weeks. Now we get insights in a day — sometimes in just a few hours. And because participants open up more with the AI moderator, the feedback is deeper and more honest.&quot;</p><p>The platform also addresses endemic fraud in online surveys, particularly when participants are compensated. Because Strella interviews happen on camera in real time, the AI moderator can detect when someone pauses suspiciously long — perhaps to consult ChatGPT — and flags them as potentially fraudulent. &quot;We are fraud resistant,&quot; Hylton said, contrasting this with traditional surveys where fraud rates can be substantial.</p><h2><b>Solving mobile app research with persistent screen sharing technology</b></h2><p>A major focus of the Series A funding will be expanding <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/strella-mobile-interview/id6746277771\"><u>Strella&#x27;s recently-launched mobile application</u></a>, which Krishnan identified as critical competitive differentiation. The mobile app enables persistent screen sharing during interviews — allowing researchers to watch users navigate mobile applications in real time while the AI moderator asks about their experience.</p><p>&quot;We are the only player in the market that supports screen sharing on mobile,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;You know, I want to understand what are the pain points with my app? Why do people not seem to be able to find the checkout flow? Well, in order to do that effectively, you&#x27;d like to see the user screen while they&#x27;re doing an interview.&quot;</p><p>For consumer-facing companies where mobile represents the primary customer interface, this capability opens entirely new use cases. The founders noted that &quot;several of our customers didn&#x27;t do research before&quot; but have now built research practices around Strella because the platform finally made mobile research accessible at scale.</p><p>The platform also supports embedding traditional survey question types directly into the conversational interview, approaching what Hylton called &quot;feature parity with a survey&quot; while maintaining the engagement advantages of a natural conversation. Strella interviews regularly run 60 to 90 minutes with nearly 100% completion rates—a duration that would see 60-70% drop-off in a traditional survey format.</p><h2><b>How Strella differentiated in a market crowded with AI research startups</b></h2><p>Strella enters a market that appears crowded at first glance, with established players like <a href=\"https://www.qualtrics.com/\"><u>Qualtrics</u></a> and a wave of AI-powered startups promising to transform customer research. The founders themselves initially pursued a different approach — synthetic respondents, or &quot;digital twins&quot; that simulate customer perspectives using large language models.</p><p>&quot;We actually pivoted from that. That was our initial idea,&quot; Hylton revealed, referring to synthetic respondents. &quot;People are very intrigued by that concept, but found in practice, no willingness to pay right now.&quot;</p><p>Recent research suggesting companies <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/this-new-ai-technique-creates-digital-twin-consumers-and-it-could-kill-the\"><u>could use language models as digital twins</u></a> for customer feedback has reignited interest in that approach. But Hylton remains skeptical: &quot;The capabilities of the LLMs as they are today are not good enough, in my opinion, to justify a standalone company. Right now you could just ask ChatGPT, &#x27;What would new users of Duolingo think about this ad copy?&#x27; You can do that. Adding the standalone idea of a synthetic panel is sort of just putting a wrapper on that.&quot;</p><p>Instead, Strella&#x27;s bet is that the real value lies in collecting proprietary qualitative data at scale — building what could become &quot;the system of truth for all qualitative insights&quot; within enterprises, as Lindsey Li, Vice President at Bessemer Venture Partners, described it.</p><p>Li, who led the investment just one year after Strella emerged from stealth, said the firm was convinced by both the technology and the team. &quot;Strella has built highly differentiated technology that enables a continuous interview rather than a survey,&quot; Li said. &quot;We heard time and time again that customers loved this product experience relative to other offerings.&quot;</p><p>On the defensibility question that concerns many AI investors, Li emphasized product execution over patents: &quot;We think the long game here will be won with a million small product decisions, all of which must be driven by deep empathy for customer pain and an understanding of how best to address their needs. Lydia and Priya exhibit that in spades.&quot;</p><p>The founders point to technical depth that&#x27;s difficult to replicate. Most competitors started with adaptive surveys — text-based interfaces where users type responses and wait for the next question. Some have added voice, but typically as uploaded audio clips rather than free-flowing conversation.</p><p>&quot;Our approach is fundamentally better, which is the fact that it is a free form conversation,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;You never have to control anything. You&#x27;re never typing, there&#x27;s no buttons, there&#x27;s no upload and wait for the next question. It&#x27;s completely free form, and that has been an extraordinarily hard product to build. There&#x27;s a tremendous amount of IP in the way that we prompt our moderator, the way that we run analysis.&quot;</p><p>The platform also improves with use, learning from each customer&#x27;s research patterns to fine-tune future interview guides and questions. &quot;Our product gets better for our customers as they continue to use us,&quot; Hylton said. All research accumulates in a central repository where teams can generate new insights by chatting with the data or creating visualizations from previously unstructured qualitative feedback.</p><h2><b>Creating new research budgets instead of just automating existing ones</b></h2><p>Perhaps more important than displacing existing research is expanding the total market. Krishnan said growth has been &quot;fundamentally related to our product&quot; creating new research that wouldn&#x27;t have happened otherwise.</p><p>&quot;We have expanded the use cases in which people would conduct research,&quot; Krishnan explained. &quot;Several of our customers didn&#x27;t do research before, have always wanted to do research, but didn&#x27;t have a dedicated researcher or team at their company that was devoted to it, and have purchased Strella to kick off and enable their research practice. That&#x27;s been really cool where we&#x27;ve seen this market just opening up.&quot;</p><p>This expansion comes as enterprises face mounting pressure to improve customer experience amid declining satisfaction scores. According to <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/press-newsroom/forrester-2024-us-customer-experience-index/\"><u>Forrester Research&#x27;s 2024 Customer Experience Index</u></a>, customer experience quality has declined for three consecutive years — an unprecedented trend. The report found that 39% of brands saw CX quality deteriorate, with declines across effectiveness, ease, and emotional connection.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions.html\"><u>Deloitte&#x27;s 2025 Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications Predictions report</u></a> forecasts that 25% of enterprises using generative AI will deploy AI agents by 2025, growing to 50% by 2027. The report specifically highlighted AI&#x27;s potential to enhance customer satisfaction by 15-20% while reducing cost to serve by 20-30% when properly implemented.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2023-08-30-gartner-reveals-three-technologies-that-will-transform-customer-service-and-support-by-2028\"><u>Gartner</u></a> identified conversational user interfaces — the category Strella inhabits — as one of three technologies poised to transform customer service by 2028, noting that &quot;customers increasingly expect to be able to interact with the applications they use in a natural way.&quot;</p><p>Against this backdrop, Li sees substantial room for growth. &quot;UX Research is a sub-sector of the $140B+ global market-research industry,&quot; Li said. &quot;This includes both the software layer historically (~$430M) and professional services spend on UX research, design, product strategy, etc. which is conservatively estimated to be ~$6.4B+ annually. As software in this vertical, led by Strella, becomes more powerful, we believe the TAM will continue to expand meaningfully.&quot;</p><h2><b>Making customer feedback accessible across the enterprise, not just research teams</b></h2><p>The founders describe their mission as &quot;democratizing access to the customer&quot; — making it possible for anyone in an organization to understand customer perspectives without waiting for dedicated research teams to complete months-long studies.</p><p>&quot;Many, many, many positions in the organization would like to get customer feedback, but it&#x27;s so hard right now,&quot; Hylton said. With Strella, she explained, someone can &quot;log into Strella and through a chat, create any highlight reel that you want and actually see customers in their own words answering the question that you have based on the research that&#x27;s already been done.&quot;</p><p>This video-first approach to research repositories changes organizational dynamics around customer feedback. &quot;Then you can say, &#x27;Okay, engineering team, we need to build this feature. And here&#x27;s the customer actually saying it,&#x27;&quot; Hylton continued. &quot;&#x27;This is not me. This isn&#x27;t politics. Here are seven customers saying they can&#x27;t find the Checkout button.&#x27; The fact that we are a very video-based platform really allows us to do that quickly and painlessly.&quot;</p><p>The company has moved decisively upmarket, with contract values now typically in the five-figure range and &quot;several six figure contracts&quot; signed, according to Krishnan. The pricing strategy reflects a premium positioning: &quot;Our product is very good, it&#x27;s very premium. We&#x27;re charging based on the value it provides to customers,&quot; Krishnan said, rather than competing on cost alone.</p><p>This approach appears to be working. The company reports 100% conversion from pilot programs to paid contracts and zero churn among its 40-45 customers, with month-over-month revenue growth of 50%.</p><h2><b>The roadmap: Computer vision, agentic AI, and human-machine collaboration</b></h2><p>The Series A funding will primarily support scaling product and go-to-market teams. &quot;We&#x27;re really confident that we have product-market fit,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;And now the question is execution, and we want to hire a lot of really talented people to help us execute.&quot;</p><p>On the product roadmap, Hylton emphasized continued focus on the participant experience as the key to winning the market. &quot;Everything else is downstream of a joyful participant experience,&quot; she said, including &quot;the quality of insights, the amount you have to pay people to do the interviews, and the way that your customers feel about a company.&quot;</p><p>Near-term priorities include adding visual capabilities so the AI moderator can respond to facial expressions and other nonverbal cues, and building more sophisticated collaboration features between human researchers and AI moderators. &quot;Maybe you want to listen while an AI moderator is running a call and you might want to be able to jump in with specific questions,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;Or you want to run an interview yourself, but you want the moderator to be there as backup or to help you.&quot;</p><p>These features move toward what the industry calls &quot;agentic AI&quot; — systems that can act more autonomously while still collaborating with humans. The founders see this human-AI collaboration, rather than full automation, as the sustainable path forward.</p><p>&quot;We believe that a lot of the really strategic work that companies do will continue to be human moderated,&quot; Hylton said. &quot;And you can still do that through Strella and just use us for synthesis in those cases.&quot;</p><p>For Li and Bessemer, the bet is on founders who understand this nuance. &quot;Lydia and Priya exhibit the exact archetype of founders we are excited to partner with for the long term — customer-obsessed, transparent, thoughtful, and singularly driven towards the home-run scenario,&quot; she said.</p><p>The company declined to disclose specific revenue figures or valuation. With the new funding, Strella has now raised $18 million total, including a <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/strella-raises-4-million-to-automate-market-research-with-ai-powered-customer-interviews\"><u>$4 million seed round led by Decibel Partners announced in October</u></a>.</p><p>As Strella scales, the founders remain focused on a vision where technology enhances rather than eliminates human judgment—where an engineering team doesn&#x27;t just read a research report, but watches seven customers struggle to find the same button. Where a product manager can query months of accumulated interviews in seconds. Where companies don&#x27;t choose between speed and depth, but get both.</p><p>&quot;The interesting part of the business is actually collecting that proprietary dataset, collecting qualitative research at scale,&quot; Hylton said, describing what she sees as Strella&#x27;s long-term moat. Not replacing the researcher, but making everyone in the company one.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Automation</category>\n            <category>Enterprise</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2MHgJSYW7aGoHqAVeFBa49/cc077429552cf090646e0177202a2e31/strella_lydia_priya_photo2.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpg\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft launches 'Hey Copilot' voice assistant and autonomous agents for all Windows 11 PCs]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-launches-hey-copilot-voice-assistant-and-autonomous-agents-for-all</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3FYlhojtFqU8GzP5bZSepN</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\"><u>Microsoft</u></a> is fundamentally reimagining how people interact with their computers, announcing Thursday a sweeping transformation of <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news\"><u>Windows 11</u></a> that brings voice-activated AI assistants, autonomous software agents, and contextual intelligence to every PC running the operating system — not just premium devices with specialized chips.</p><p>The announcement represents <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news\"><u>Microsoft&#x27;s most aggressive push yet</u></a> to integrate generative artificial intelligence into the desktop computing experience, moving beyond the chatbot interfaces that have defined the first wave of consumer AI products toward a more ambient, conversational model where users can simply talk to their computers and have AI agents complete complex tasks on their behalf.</p><p>&quot;When we think about what the promise of an AI PC is, it should be capable of three things,&quot; Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft&#x27;s Executive Vice President and Consumer Chief Marketing Officer, told reporters at a press conference last week. &quot;First, you should be able to interact with it naturally, in text or voice, and have it understand you. Second, it should be able to see what you see and be able to offer guided support. And third, it should be able to take action on your behalf.&quot;</p><p>The shift could prove consequential for an industry searching for the &quot;killer app&quot; for generative AI.

The feature, which had been in limited testing, is now being rolled out to hundreds of millions of devices globally.</p><p>&quot;It&#x27;s been almost four decades since the PC has changed the way you interact with it, which is primarily mouse and keyboard,&quot; Mehdi said. &quot;When you think about it, we find that people type on a given day up to 14,000 words on their keyboard, which is really kind of mind-boggling. But what if now you can go beyond that and talk to it?&quot;</p><p>The emphasis on voice reflects internal Microsoft data showing that users engage with Copilot twice as much when using voice compared to text input — a finding the company attributes to the lower cognitive barrier of speaking versus crafting precise written prompts.</p><p>&quot;The magic unlock with <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/for-individuals/do-more-with-ai/general-ai/what-is-copilot-voice\"><u>Copilot Voice</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/\"><u>Copilot Vision</u></a> is the ease of interaction,&quot; according to the company&#x27;s announcement. &quot;Using the new wake word, &#x27;<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/05/14/copilot-on-windows-hey-copilot-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/\"><u>Hey Copilot</u></a>,&#x27; getting something done is as easy as just asking for it.&quot;</p><p>But Microsoft&#x27;s bet on voice computing faces real-world constraints that Mehdi acknowledged during the briefing. When asked whether workers in shared office environments would use voice features, potentially compromising privacy, Mehdi noted that millions already conduct voice calls through their PCs with headphones, and predicted users would adapt: &quot;Just like when the mouse came out, people have to figure out when to use it, what&#x27;s the right way, how to make it happen.&quot;</p><p>Crucially, Microsoft is hedging its voice-first strategy by making all features accessible through traditional text input as well, recognizing that voice isn&#x27;t always appropriate or accessible.</p><h2><b>AI that sees your screen: Copilot Vision expands worldwide with new capabilities</b></h2><p>Perhaps more transformative than voice control is the expansion of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/\"><u>Copilot Vision</u></a>, a feature Microsoft introduced earlier this year that allows the AI to analyze what&#x27;s displayed on a user&#x27;s screen and provide contextual assistance.</p><p>Previously limited to voice interaction, Copilot Vision is now rolling out worldwide with a new text-based interface, allowing users to type questions about what they&#x27;re viewing rather than speaking them aloud. The feature can now access full document context in <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-office\"><u>Microsoft Office</u></a> applications — meaning it can analyze an entire PowerPoint presentation or Excel spreadsheet without the user needing to scroll through every page.</p><p>&quot;With 68 percent of consumers reporting using AI to support their decision making, voice is making this easier,&quot; Microsoft explained in its announcement. &quot;The magic unlock with Copilot Voice and Copilot Vision is the ease of interaction.&quot;</p><p>During the press briefing, Microsoft demonstrated <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/2024/12/05/copilot-vision-now-in-preview-a-new-way-to-browse/\"><u>Copilot Vision</u></a> helping users navigate Spotify&#x27;s settings to enable lossless audio streaming, coaching an artist through writing a professional bio based on their visual portfolio, and providing shopping recommendations based on products visible in YouTube videos.</p><p>&quot;What brings AI to life is when you can give it rich context, when you can type great prompts,&quot; Mehdi explained. &quot;The big challenge for the majority of people is we&#x27;ve been trained with search to do the opposite. We&#x27;ve been trained to essentially type in fewer keywords, because it turns out the less keywords you type on search, the better your answers are.&quot;</p><p>He noted that average search queries remain just 2.3 keywords, while AI systems perform better with detailed prompts — creating a disconnect between user habits and AI capabilities. Copilot Vision aims to bridge that gap by automatically gathering visual context.</p><p>&quot;With Copilot Vision, you can simply share your screen and Copilot in literally milliseconds can understand everything on the screen and then provide intelligence,&quot; Mehdi said.</p><p>The vision capabilities work with any application without requiring developers to build specific integrations, using computer vision to interpret on-screen content — a powerful capability that also raises questions about what the AI can access and when.</p><h2><b>Software robots take control: Inside Copilot Actions&#x27; controversial autonomy</b></h2><p>The most ambitious—and potentially controversial—new capability is <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/11/19/introducing-copilot-actions-new-agents-and-tools-to-empower-it-teams/\"><u>Copilot Actions</u></a>, an experimental feature that allows AI to take control of a user&#x27;s computer to complete tasks autonomously.</p><p>Coming first to <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/windowsinsider/\"><u>Windows Insiders enrolled in Copilot Labs</u></a>, the feature builds on Microsoft&#x27;s May announcement of Copilot Actions on the web, extending the capability to manipulate local files and applications on Windows PCs.</p><p>During demonstrations, Microsoft showed the AI agent organizing photo libraries, extracting data from documents, and working through multi-step tasks while users attended to other work. The agent operates in a separate, sandboxed environment and provides running commentary on its actions, with users able to take control at any time.</p><p>&quot;As a general-purpose agent — simply describe the task you want to complete in your own words, and the agent will attempt to complete it by interacting with desktop and web applications,&quot; according to the announcement. &quot;While this is happening, you can choose to focus on other tasks. At any time, you can take over the task or check in on the progress of the action, including reviewing what actions have been taken.&quot;</p><p>Navjot Burke, Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Experience Leader, acknowledged the technology&#x27;s current limitations during the briefing. &quot;We&#x27;ll be starting with a narrow set of use cases while we optimize model performance and learn,&quot; Burke said. &quot;You may see the agent make mistakes or encounter challenges with complex interfaces, which is why real-world testing of this experience is so critical.&quot;</p><p>The experimental nature of <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2024/11/19/introducing-copilot-actions-new-agents-and-tools-to-empower-it-teams/\"><u>Copilot Actions</u></a> reflects broader industry challenges with agentic AI — systems that can take actions rather than simply providing information. While the potential productivity gains are substantial, AI systems still occasionally &quot;hallucinate&quot; incorrect information and can be vulnerable to novel attacks.</p><h2><b>Can AI agents be trusted? Microsoft&#x27;s new security framework explained</b></h2><p>Recognizing the security implications of giving AI control over users&#x27; computers and files, Microsoft introduced a new security framework built on four core principles: user control, operational transparency, limited privileges, and privacy-preserving design.</p><p>Central to this approach is the concept of &quot;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/agents\"><u>agent accounts</u></a>&quot; — separate Windows user accounts under which AI agents operate, distinct from the human user&#x27;s account. Combined with a new &quot;agent workspace&quot; that provides a sandboxed desktop environment, the architecture aims to create clear boundaries around what agents can access and modify.</p><p>Peter Waxman, Microsoft&#x27;s Windows Security Engineering Leader, emphasized that Copilot Actions is disabled by default and requires explicit user opt-in. &quot;You&#x27;re always in control of what Copilot Actions can do,&quot; Waxman said. &quot;Copilot Actions is turned off by default and you&#x27;re able to pause, take control, or disable it at any time.&quot;</p><p>During operation, users can monitor the agent&#x27;s progress in real-time, and the system requests additional approval before taking &quot;sensitive or important&quot; actions. All agent activity occurs under the dedicated agent account, creating an audit trail that distinguishes AI actions from human ones.</p><p>However, the agent will have default access to users&#x27; Documents, Downloads, Desktop, and Pictures folders—a broad permission grant that could concern enterprise IT administrators.</p><p>Dana Huang, Corporate Vice President for Windows Security, acknowledged in a blog post that &quot;agentic AI applications introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.&quot;</p><p>Microsoft promises more details about enterprise controls at its <a href=\"https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/home\"><u>Ignite conference</u></a> in November.</p><h2><b>Gaming, taskbar redesign, and deeper Office integration round out updates</b></h2><p>Beyond voice and autonomous agents, Microsoft introduced changes across Windows 11&#x27;s core interfaces and extended AI to new domains.</p><p>A new &quot;<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11?r=1\"><u>Ask Copilot</u></a>&quot; feature integrates AI directly into the Windows taskbar, providing one-click access to start conversations, activate vision capabilities, or search for files and settings with &quot;lightning-fast&quot; results. The opt-in feature doesn&#x27;t replace traditional Windows search.</p><p>File Explorer gains AI capabilities through integration with third-party services. A partnership with Manus AI allows users to right-click on local image files and generate complete websites without manual uploading or coding. Integration with Filmora enables quick jumps into video editing workflows.</p><p>Microsoft also introduced <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/overview-copilot-connector\"><u>Copilot Connectors</u></a>, allowing users to link cloud services like OneDrive, Outlook, Google Drive, Gmail, and Google Calendar directly to Copilot on Windows. Once connected, users can query personal content across platforms using natural language.</p><p>In a notable expansion beyond productivity, Microsoft and Xbox introduced Gaming Copilot for the <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally\"><u>ROG Xbox Ally</u></a> handheld gaming devices developed with ASUS. The feature, accessible via a dedicated hardware button, provides an AI assistant that can answer gameplay questions, offer strategic advice, and help navigate game interfaces through natural voice conversation.</p><h2><b>Why Microsoft is racing to embed AI everywhere before Apple and Google</b></h2><p>Microsoft&#x27;s announcement comes as technology giants race to embed generative AI into their core products following the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. While Microsoft moved quickly to <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/\"><u>integrate OpenAI&#x27;s technology into Bing search</u></a> and introduce Copilot across its product line, the company has faced questions about whether AI features are driving meaningful engagement. Recent data shows <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\"><u>Bing&#x27;s search market share</u></a> remaining largely flat despite AI integration.</p><p>The Windows integration represents a different approach: rather than charging separately for AI features, Microsoft is building them into the operating system itself, betting that embedded AI will drive Windows 11 adoption and competitive differentiation against Apple and Google.</p><p>Apple has taken a more cautious approach with <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-intelligence/\"><u>Apple Intelligence</u></a>, introducing AI features gradually and emphasizing privacy through on-device processing. Google has integrated AI across its services but has faced challenges with accuracy and reliability.</p><p>Crucially, while Microsoft highlighted <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/copilot-plus-pcs\"><u>new Copilot+ PC models</u></a> from partners with prices ranging from $649.99 to $1,499.99, the core AI features announced today <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news\"><u>work on any Windows 11 PC</u></a> — a significant departure from earlier positioning that suggested AI capabilities required new hardware with specialized neural processing units.</p><p>&quot;Everything we showed you here is for all Windows 11 PCs. You don&#x27;t need to run it on a copilot plus PC. It works on any Windows 11 PC,&quot; Mehdi clarified.</p><p>This democratization of AI features across the Windows 11 installed base potentially accelerates adoption but also complicates Microsoft&#x27;s hardware sales pitch for premium devices.</p><h2><b>What Microsoft&#x27;s AI bet means for the future of computing</b></h2><p>Mehdi framed the announcement in sweeping terms, describing Microsoft&#x27;s goal as fundamentally reimagining the operating system for the AI era.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re taking kind of a bold view of it. We really feel that the vision that we have is, let&#x27;s rewrite the entire operating system around AI and build essentially what becomes truly the AI PC,&quot; he said.</p><p>For Microsoft, the success of <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news\"><u>AI-powered Windows 11</u></a> could help drive the company&#x27;s next phase of growth as PC sales have matured and cloud growth faces increased competition.</p><p>For users and organizations, the announcement represents a potential inflection point in how humans interact with computers — one that could significantly boost productivity if executed well, or create new security headaches if the AI proves unreliable or difficult to control.</p><p>The technology industry will be watching closely to see whether Microsoft&#x27;s bet on conversational computing and agentic AI marks the beginning of a genuine paradigm shift, or proves to be another ambitious interface reimagining that fails to gain mainstream traction.</p><p>What&#x27;s clear is that Microsoft is moving aggressively to stake its claim as the leader in AI-powered personal computing, leveraging its dominant position in desktop operating systems to bring generative AI directly into the daily workflows of potentially a billion users.</p><p>Copilot Voice and Vision are <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/windows-october-2025-news\"><u>available today</u></a> to Windows 11 users worldwide, with experimental capabilities coming to Windows Insiders in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Automation</category>\n            <category>Security</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/1LtYH6GIABRoimOmrndJLF/cc718a2cc21b1fef4c64bebfe4a3a965/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_Microsoft_Windows_desktop_computer_mode_02e6a80a-72d4-467e-94ba-e6dfdd7d49c5.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Anthropic is giving away its powerful Claude Haiku 4.5 AI for free to take on OpenAI]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-is-giving-away-its-powerful-claude-haiku-4-5-ai-for-free-to-take</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4q7lyKtA1NsY38V1q3km7t</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://anthropic.com/\"><u>Anthropic</u></a> released <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Claude Haiku 4.5</u></a> on Wednesday, a smaller and significantly cheaper artificial intelligence model that matches the coding capabilities of systems that were considered cutting-edge just months ago, marking the latest salvo in an intensifying competition to dominate enterprise AI.</p><p>The model costs $1 per million input tokens and $5 per million output tokens — roughly one-third the price of Anthropic&#x27;s mid-sized <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4\"><u>Sonnet 4 model</u></a> released in May, while operating more than twice as fast. In certain tasks, particularly operating computers autonomously, Haiku 4.5 actually surpasses its more expensive predecessor.</p><p>&quot;Haiku 4.5 is a clear leap in performance and is now largely as smart as Sonnet 4 while being significantly faster and one-third of the cost,&quot; an Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat, underscoring how rapidly AI capabilities are becoming commoditized as the technology matures.</p><p>The launch comes just two weeks after Anthropic released <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5\"><u>Claude Sonnet 4.5</u></a>, which the company bills as the world&#x27;s best coding model, and two months after introducing Opus 4.1. The breakneck pace of releases reflects mounting pressure from OpenAI, whose $500 billion valuation dwarfs <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropic-raises-series-f-at-usd183b-post-money-valuation\"><u>Anthropic&#x27;s $183 billion</u></a>, and which has inked a series of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals while expanding its product lineup.</p><h2><b>How free access to advanced AI could reshape the enterprise market</b></h2><p>In an unusual move that could reshape competitive dynamics in the AI market, Anthropic is making Haiku 4.5 available for all free users of its <a href=\"http://claude.ai\"><u>Claude.ai</u></a> platform. The decision effectively democratizes access to what the company characterizes as &quot;near-frontier-level intelligence&quot; — capabilities that would have been available only in expensive, premium models months ago.</p><p>&quot;The launch of Claude Haiku 4.5 means that near-frontier-level intelligence is available for free to all users through Claude.ai,&quot; the Anthropic spokesperson told VentureBeat. &quot;It also offers significant advantages to our enterprise customers: Sonnet 4.5 can handle frontier planning while Haiku 4.5 powers sub-agents, enabling multi-agent systems that tackle complex refactors, migrations, and large features builds with speed and quality.&quot;</p><p>This multi-agent architecture signals a significant shift in how AI systems are deployed. Rather than relying on a single, monolithic model, enterprises can now orchestrate teams of specialized AI agents: a more sophisticated <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5\"><u>Sonnet 4.5 model</u></a> breaking down complex problems and delegating subtasks to multiple <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> agents working in parallel. For software development teams, this could mean Sonnet 4.5 plans a major code refactoring while Haiku 4.5 agents simultaneously execute changes across dozens of files.</p><p>The approach mirrors how human organizations distribute work, and could prove particularly valuable for enterprises seeking to balance performance with cost efficiency — a critical consideration as AI deployment scales.</p><h2><b>Inside Anthropic&#x27;s path to $7 billion in annual revenue</b></h2><p>The model launch coincides with revelations that Anthropic&#x27;s business is experiencing explosive growth. The company&#x27;s annual revenue run rate is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/anthropic-aims-nearly-triple-annualized-revenue-2026-sources-say-2025-10-15/\"><u>approaching $7 billion this month</u></a>, Anthropic told Reuters, up from more than $5 billion reported in August. Internal projections obtained by Reuters suggest the company is targeting between $20 billion and $26 billion in annualized revenue for 2026, representing growth of more than 200% to nearly 300%.</p><p>The company now serves more than 300,000 business customers, with enterprise products accounting for approximately 80% of revenue. Among Anthropic&#x27;s most successful offerings is <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code\"><u>Claude Code</u></a>, a code-generation tool that has reached nearly $1 billion in annualized revenue since launching earlier this year.</p><p>Those numbers come as artificial intelligence enters what many in the industry characterize as a critical inflection point. After two years of what Anthropic Chief Product Officer Mike Krieger recently described as &quot;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-cpo-companies-success-metrics-avoid-ai-fomo-2025-10\"><u>AI FOMO</u></a>&quot; — where companies adopted AI tools without clear success metrics — enterprises are now demanding measurable returns on investment.</p><p>&quot;The best products can be grounded in some kind of success metric or evaluation,&quot; Krieger said on the <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inside-claude-the-ai-coworker-era-mike-krieger-anthropic/id1759013677?i=1000731964089\"><u>&quot;Superhuman AI&quot; podcast</u></a>. &quot;I&#x27;ve seen that a lot in talking to companies that are deploying AI.&quot;</p><p>For enterprises evaluating AI tools, the calculus increasingly centers on concrete productivity gains. Google CEO Sundar Pichai claimed in June that AI had generated a 10% boost in engineering velocity at his company — though measuring such improvements across different roles and use cases remains challenging, as Krieger acknowledged.</p><h2><b>Why AI safety testing matters more than ever for enterprise adoption</b></h2><p>Anthropic&#x27;s launch comes amid heightened scrutiny of the company&#x27;s approach to AI safety and regulation. On Tuesday, David Sacks, the White House&#x27;s AI &quot;czar&quot; and a venture capitalist, accused Anthropic of &quot;<a href=\"https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1978145266269077891\"><u>running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering&quot; that is &quot;damaging the startup ecosystem</u></a>.&quot;</p><p>The attack targeted remarks by Jack Clark, Anthropic&#x27;s British co-founder and head of policy, who had described being &quot;<a href=\"https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-431-technological-optimism\"><u>deeply afraid</u></a>&quot; of AI&#x27;s trajectory. Clark told Bloomberg he found Sacks&#x27; criticism &quot;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-10-15/anthropic-s-ai-principles-make-it-a-white-house-target\"><u>perplexing</u></a>.&quot;</p><p>Anthropic addressed such concerns head-on in its release materials, emphasizing that <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> underwent extensive safety testing. The company classified the model as <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy\"><u>ASL-2</u></a> — its AI Safety Level 2 standard — compared to the more restrictive <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy\"><u>ASL-3</u></a> designation for the more powerful Sonnet 4.5 and Opus 4.1 models.</p><p>&quot;Our teams have red-teamed and tested our agentic capabilities to the limits in order to assess whether it can be used to engage in harmful activity like generating misinformation or promoting fraudulent behavior like scams,&quot; the spokesperson told VentureBeat. &quot;In our automated alignment assessment, it showed a statistically significantly lower overall rate of misaligned behaviors than both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Claude Opus 4.1 — making it, by this metric, our safest model yet.&quot;</p><p>The company said its safety testing showed <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> poses only limited risks regarding the production of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. Anthropic has also implemented classifiers designed to detect and filter prompt injection attacks, a common method for attempting to manipulate AI systems into producing harmful content.</p><p>The emphasis on safety reflects Anthropic&#x27;s founding mission. The company was established in 2021 by former OpenAI executives, including siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei, who left amid concerns about OpenAI&#x27;s direction following its partnership with Microsoft. Anthropic has positioned itself as taking a more cautious, research-oriented approach to AI development.</p><h2><b>Benchmark results show Haiku 4.5 competing with larger, more expensive models</b></h2><p>According to Anthropic&#x27;s benchmarks, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> performs competitively with or exceeds several larger models across multiple evaluation criteria. On <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\"><u>SWE-bench Verified</u></a>, a widely used test measuring AI systems&#x27; ability to solve real-world software engineering problems, Haiku 4.5 scored 73.3% — slightly ahead of Sonnet 4&#x27;s 72.7% and close to GPT-5 Codex&#x27;s 74.5%.</p><p>The model demonstrated particular strength in computer use tasks, achieving 50.7% on the <a href=\"https://os-world.github.io/\"><u>OSWorld benchmark</u></a> compared to Sonnet 4&#x27;s 42.2%. This capability allows the AI to interact directly with computer interfaces — clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating applications — which could prove transformative for automating routine digital tasks.</p><p>In coding-specific benchmarks like <a href=\"https://www.tbench.ai/\"><u>Terminal-Bench</u></a>, which tests AI agents&#x27; ability to complete complex software tasks using command-line tools, Haiku 4.5 scored 41.0%, trailing only Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s 50.0% among Claude models.</p><p>The model maintains a 200,000-token context window for standard users, with developers accessing the <a href=\"https://www.claude.com/platform/api\"><u>Claude Developer Platform</u></a> able to use a 1-million-token context window. That expanded capacity means the model can process extremely large codebases or documents in a single request — roughly equivalent to a 1,500-page book.</p><h2><b>What three major AI model releases in two months says about the competition</b></h2><p>When asked about the rapid succession of model releases, the Anthropic spokesperson emphasized the company&#x27;s focus on execution rather than competitive positioning.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re focused on shipping the best possible products for our customers — and our shipping velocity speaks for itself,&quot; the spokesperson said. &quot;What was state-of-the-art just five months ago is now faster, cheaper, and more accessible.&quot;</p><p>That velocity stands in contrast to the company&#x27;s earlier, more measured release schedule. Anthropic appeared to have paused development of its Haiku line after releasing version 3.5 at the end of last year, leading some observers to speculate the company had deprioritized smaller models.</p><p>That rapid price-performance improvement validates a core promise of artificial intelligence: that capabilities will become dramatically cheaper over time as the technology matures and companies optimize their models. For enterprises, it suggests that today&#x27;s budget constraints around AI deployment may ease considerably in coming years.</p><h2><b>From customer service to code: Real-world applications for faster, cheaper AI</b></h2><p>The practical applications of <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> span a wide range of enterprise functions, from customer service to financial analysis to software development. The model&#x27;s combination of speed and intelligence makes it particularly suited for real-time, low-latency tasks like chatbot conversations and customer support interactions, where delays of even a few seconds can degrade user experience.</p><p>In financial services, the multi-agent architecture enabled by pairing <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5\"><u>Sonnet 4.5</u></a> with <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> could transform how firms monitor markets and manage risk. Anthropic envisions Haiku 4.5 monitoring thousands of data streams simultaneously — tracking regulatory changes, market signals and portfolio risks — while Sonnet 4.5 handles complex predictive modeling and strategic analysis.</p><p>For research organizations, the division of labor could compress timelines dramatically. <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-sonnet-4-5\"><u>Sonnet 4.5</u></a> might orchestrate a comprehensive analysis while multiple <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> agents parallelize literature reviews, data gathering and document synthesis across dozens of sources, potentially &quot;compressing weeks of research into hours,&quot; according to Anthropic&#x27;s use case descriptions.</p><p>Several companies have already integrated Haiku 4.5 and reported positive results. Guy Gur-Ari, co-founder of coding startup Augment, said the model &quot;hit a sweet spot we didn&#x27;t think was possible: near-frontier coding quality with blazing speed and cost efficiency.&quot; In Augment&#x27;s internal testing, Haiku 4.5 achieved 90% of Sonnet 4.5&#x27;s performance while matching much larger models.</p><p>Jeff Wang, CEO of Windsurf, another coding-focused startup, said Haiku 4.5 &quot;is blurring the lines&quot; on traditional trade-offs between speed, cost and quality. &quot;It&#x27;s a fast frontier model that keeps costs efficient and signals where this class of models is headed.&quot;</p><p>Jon Noronha, co-founder of presentation software company Gamma, reported that Haiku 4.5 &quot;outperformed our current models on instruction-following for slide text generation, achieving 65% accuracy versus 44% from our premium tier model — that&#x27;s a game-changer for our unit economics.&quot;</p><h2><b>The price of progress: What plummeting AI costs mean for enterprise strategy</b></h2><p>For enterprises evaluating AI strategies, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5\"><u>Haiku 4.5</u></a> presents both opportunity and challenge. The opportunity lies in accessing sophisticated AI capabilities at dramatically lower costs, potentially making viable entire categories of applications that were previously too expensive to deploy at scale.</p><p>The challenge is keeping pace with a technology landscape that is evolving faster than most organizations can absorb. As Krieger noted in his recent podcast appearance, companies are moving beyond &quot;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anthropic-cpo-companies-success-metrics-avoid-ai-fomo-2025-10\"><u>AI FOMO</u></a>&quot; to demand concrete metrics and demonstrated value. But establishing those metrics and evaluation frameworks takes time — time that may be in short supply as competitors race ahead.</p><p>The shift from single-model deployments to multi-agent architectures also requires new ways of thinking about AI systems. Rather than viewing AI as a monolithic assistant, enterprises must learn to orchestrate multiple specialized agents, each optimized for particular tasks — more akin to managing a team than operating a tool.</p><p>The fundamental economics of AI are shifting with remarkable speed. Five months ago, Sonnet 4&#x27;s capabilities commanded premium pricing and represented the cutting edge. Today, Haiku 4.5 delivers similar performance at a third of the cost. If that trajectory continues — and both Anthropic&#x27;s release schedule and competitive pressure from OpenAI and Google suggest it will — the AI capabilities that seem remarkable today may be routine and inexpensive within a year.</p><p>For Anthropic, the challenge will be translating technical achievements into sustainable business growth while maintaining the safety-focused approach that differentiates it from competitors. The company&#x27;s projected revenue growth to as much as $26 billion by 2026 suggests strong market traction, but achieving those targets will require continued innovation and successful execution across an increasingly complex product portfolio.</p><p>Whether enterprises will choose Claude over increasingly capable alternatives from OpenAI, Google and a growing field of competitors remains an open question. But Anthropic is making a clear bet: that the future of AI belongs not to whoever builds the single most powerful model, but to whoever can deliver the right intelligence, at the right speed, at the right price — and make it accessible to everyone.</p><p>In an industry where the promise of artificial intelligence has long outpaced reality, Anthropic is betting that delivering on that promise, faster and cheaper than anyone expected, will be enough to win. And with pricing dropping by two-thirds in just five months while performance holds steady, that promise is starting to look like reality.</p><p>\n\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>technology</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2zkV6Ua9HruRsjBAfq9oS2/3c44bad93ee87a4a9c84b418279acccb/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_a_computer_image_in_burnt_orange_58827742-c30a-4256-9cf3-c7802772a6c7.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Google releases new AI video model Veo 3.1 in Flow and API: what it means for enterprises]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-releases-new-ai-video-model-veo-3-1-in-flow-and-api-what-it-means-for</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6VunZUAnv1xwS28YF3fC3Z</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:50:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>As expected after days of leaks and rumors online, Google has <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/veo-updates-flow/\">unveiled Veo 3.1</a>, its latest AI video generation model, bringing a suite of creative and technical upgrades aimed at improving narrative control, audio integration, and realism in AI-generated video. </p><p>While the updates expand possibilities for hobbyists and content creators using Google’s online AI creation app, <a href=\"https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow\">Flow</a>, the release also signals a growing opportunity for enterprises, developers, and creative teams seeking scalable, customizable video tools.</p><p>The quality is higher, the physics better, the pricing the same as before, and the control and editing features more robust and varied.</p><div></div><p>My <a href=\"https://x.com/carlfranzen/status/1978522697014411322\">initial tests</a> showed it to be a powerful and performant model that immediately delights with each generation. However, the look is more cinematic, polished and a little more &quot;artificial&quot; than by default than rivals such as <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-debuts-sora-2-ai-video-generator-app-with-sound-and-self-insertion\">OpenAI&#x27;s new Sora 2</a>, released late last month, which may or may not be what a particular user is going after (Sora excels at handheld and &quot;candid&quot; style videos). </p><h3><b>Expanded Control Over Narrative and Audio</b></h3><p>Veo 3.1 builds on its predecessor, Veo 3 (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/google-ai-video-generator-audio-veo-3.html\">released back in May 2025</a>) with enhanced support for dialogue, ambient sound, and other audio effects. </p><p>Native audio generation is now available across several key features in Flow, including “Frames to Video,” “Ingredients to Video,” and “Extend,&quot; which give users the ability to, respectively: turn still images into video; use items, characters and objects from multiple images in a single video; and generate longer clips than the initial 8 seconds, to more than 30 seconds or even 1+ plus when continuing from a prior clip&#x27;s final frame. </p><p>Before, you had to add audio manually after using these features. </p><p>This addition gives users greater command over tone, emotion, and storytelling — capabilities that have previously required post-production work.</p><p>In enterprise contexts, this level of control may reduce the need for separate audio pipelines, offering an integrated way to create training content, marketing videos, or digital experiences with synchronized sound and visuals.</p><p>Google noted in <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/ai/veo-updates-flow/\">a blog post</a> that the updates reflect user feedback calling for deeper artistic control and improved audio support. Gallegos emphasizes the importance of making edits and refinements possible directly in Flow, without reworking scenes from scratch.</p><h3><b>Richer Inputs and Editing Capabilities</b></h3><p>With Veo 3.1, Google introduces support for multiple input types and more granular control over generated outputs. The model accepts text prompts, images, and video clips as input, and also supports:</p><ul><li><p><b>Reference images (up to three)</b> to guide appearance and style in the final output</p></li><li><p><b>First and last frame interpolation</b> to generate seamless scenes between fixed endpoints</p></li><li><p><b>Scene extension</b> that continues a video’s action or motion beyond its current duration</p></li></ul><p>These tools aim to give enterprise users a way to fine-tune the look and feel of their content—useful for brand consistency or adherence to creative briefs.</p><p>Additional capabilities like “Insert” (add objects to scenes) and “Remove” (delete elements or characters) are also being introduced, though not all are immediately available through the Gemini API.</p><h3><b>Deployment Across Platforms</b></h3><p>Veo 3.1 is accessible through several of Google’s existing AI services:</p><ul><li><p><a href=\"https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow\"><b>Flow</b></a>, Google’s own interface for AI-assisted filmmaking</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/video?example=dialogue\"><b>Gemini API</b></a>, targeted at developers building video capabilities into applications</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/veo-video-generation\"><b>Vertex AI</b></a>, where enterprise integration will soon support Veo’s “Scene Extension” and other key features</p></li></ul><p>Availability through these platforms allows enterprise customers to choose the right environment—GUI-based or programmatic—based on their teams and workflows.</p><h3><b>Pricing and Access</b></h3><p>The Veo 3.1 model is currently in <b>preview</b> and available only on the <b>paid tier</b> of the Gemini API. The cost structure is the same as Veo 3, the preceding generation of AI video models from Google.</p><ul><li><p><b>Standard model</b>: $0.40 per second of video</p></li><li><p><b>Fast model</b>: $0.15 per second</p></li></ul><p>There is no free tier, and users are charged only if a video is successfully generated. This model is consistent with previous Veo versions and provides predictable pricing for budget-conscious enterprise teams.</p><h3><b>Technical Specs and Output Control</b></h3><p>Veo 3.1 outputs video at <b>720p or 1080p resolution</b>, with a <b>24 fps frame rate</b>. </p><p>Duration options include <b>4, 6, or 8 seconds </b>from a text prompt or uploaded images, with the ability to extend videos up to <b>148 seconds (more than 2 and half minutes!)</b> when using the “Extend” feature.</p><p>New functionality also includes tighter control over subjects and environments. For example, enterprises can upload a product image or visual reference, and Veo 3.1 will generate scenes that preserve its appearance and stylistic cues across the video. This could streamline creative production pipelines for retail, advertising, and virtual content production teams.</p><h3><b>Initial Reactions</b></h3><p>The broader creator and developer community has responded to Veo 3.1’s launch with a mix of optimism and tempered critique—particularly when comparing it to rival models like OpenAI’s Sora 2.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1978503288992461205\">Matt Shumer,</a> an AI founder of Otherside AI/Hyperwrite, and early adopter, described his initial reaction as “disappointment,” noting that Veo 3.1 is “noticeably worse than Sora 2” and also “quite a bit more expensive.”</p><p>However, he acknowledged that Google’s tooling—such as support for references and scene extension—is a bright spot in the release.</p><p><a href=\"https://x.com/MrDavids1/status/1978460666395505004\"><b>Travis Davids</b></a>, a 3D digital artist and AI content creator, echoed some of that sentiment. While he noted improvements in audio quality, particularly in sound effects and dialogue, he raised concerns about limitations that remain in the system. </p><p>These include the lack of custom voice support, an inability to select generated voices directly, and the continued cap at 8-second generations—despite some public claims about longer outputs.</p><p>Davids also pointed out that character consistency across changing camera angles still requires careful prompting, whereas other models like Sora 2 handle this more automatically. He questioned the absence of 1080p resolution for users on paid tiers like Flow Pro and expressed skepticism over feature parity.</p><p>On the more positive end, <a href=\"https://x.com/kimmonismus\">@kimmonismus,</a> an AI newsletter writer, stated that “Veo 3.1 is amazing,” though still concluded that OpenAI’s latest model remains preferable overall.</p><p>Collectively, these early impressions suggest that while Veo 3.1 delivers meaningful tooling enhancements and new creative control features, expectations have shifted as competitors raise the bar on both quality and usability.</p><h3><b>Adoption and Scale</b></h3><p>Since launching Flow five months ago, Google says over <b>275 million videos</b> have been generated across various Veo models. </p><p>The pace of adoption suggests significant interest not only from individuals but also from developers and businesses experimenting with automated content creation.</p><p>Thomas Iljic, Director of Product Management at Google Labs, highlights that Veo 3.1’s release brings capabilities closer to how human filmmakers plan and shoot. These include scene composition, continuity across shots, and coordinated audio—all areas that enterprises increasingly look to automate or streamline.</p><h3><b>Safety and Responsible AI Use</b></h3><p>Videos generated with Veo 3.1 are watermarked using Google’s <b>SynthID</b> technology, which embeds an imperceptible identifier to signal that the content is AI-generated. </p><p>Google applies safety filters and moderation across its APIs to help minimize privacy and copyright risks. Generated content is stored temporarily and deleted after two days unless downloaded.</p><p>For developers and enterprises, these features provide reassurance around provenance and compliance—critical in regulated or brand-sensitive industries.</p><h3><b>Where Veo 3.1 Stands Among a Crowded AI Video Model Space</b></h3><p>Veo 3.1 is not just an iteration on prior models—it represents a deeper integration of multimodal inputs, storytelling control, and enterprise-level tooling. While creative professionals may see immediate benefits in editing workflows and fidelity, businesses exploring automation in training, advertising, or virtual experiences may find even greater value in the model’s composability and API support.</p><p>The early user feedback highlights that while Veo 3.1 offers valuable tooling, expectations around realism, voice control, and generation length are evolving rapidly. As Google expands access through Vertex AI and continues refining Veo, its competitive positioning in enterprise video generation will hinge on how quickly these user pain points are addressed.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4tvp7qfEbQOW0pucNGc3oW/21a8f215813133c934f9e71c0acff280/Screenshot_2025-10-15_at_2.53.23â__PM.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Dfinity launches Caffeine, an AI platform that builds production apps from natural language prompts]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/dfinity-launches-caffeine-an-ai-platform-that-builds-production-apps-from</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6tnBbkc3ZJJHrzEx70wOBl</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>The <a href=\"https://dfinity.org/\"><u>Dfinity Foundation</u></a> on Wednesday released <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a>, an artificial intelligence platform that allows users to build and deploy web applications through natural language conversation alone, bypassing traditional coding entirely. The system, which became publicly available today, represents a fundamental departure from existing AI coding assistants by building applications on a specialized decentralized infrastructure designed specifically for autonomous AI development.</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, <a href=\"https://cursor.com/\"><u>Cursor</u></a>, or other &quot;vibe coding&quot; tools that help human developers write code faster, Caffeine positions itself as a complete replacement for technical teams. Users describe what they want in plain language, and an ensemble of AI models writes, deploys, and continually updates production-grade applications — with no human intervention in the codebase itself.</p><p>&quot;In the future, you as a prospective app owner or service owner… will talk to AI. AI will give you what you want on a URL,&quot; said Dominic Williams, founder and chief scientist at the Dfinity Foundation, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;You will use that, completely interact productively, and you&#x27;ll just keep talking to AI to evolve what that does. The AI, or an ensemble of AIs, will be your tech team.&quot;</p><p>The platform has attracted significant early interest: more than 15,000 alpha users tested Caffeine before its public release, with daily active users representing 26% of those who received access codes — &quot;early Facebook kind of levels,&quot; according to Williams. The foundation reports some users spending entire days building applications on the platform, forcing Dfinity to consider usage limits due to underlying AI infrastructure costs.</p><h2><b>Why Caffeine&#x27;s custom programming language guarantees your data won&#x27;t disappear</b></h2><p>Caffeine&#x27;s most significant technical claim addresses a problem that has plagued AI-generated code: data loss during application updates. The platform builds applications using <a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home\"><u>Motoko</u></a>, a programming language developed by Dfinity specifically for AI use, which provides mathematical guarantees that upgrades cannot accidentally delete user data.</p><p>&quot;When AI is updating apps and services in production, a mistake cannot lose data. That&#x27;s a guarantee,&quot; Williams said. &quot;It&#x27;s not like there are some safeguards to try and stop it losing data. This language framework gives it rails that guarantee if an upgrade, an update to its app&#x27;s underlying logic, would cause data loss, the upgrade fails and the AI just tries again.&quot;</p><p>This addresses what Williams characterizes as critical failures in competing platforms. User forums for tools like <a href=\"https://lovable.dev/\"><u>Lovable</u></a> and <a href=\"https://replit.com/\"><u>Replit</u></a>, he notes, frequently report three major problems: applications that become irreparably broken as complexity increases, security vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access, and mysterious data loss during updates.</p><p>Traditional tech stacks evolved to meet human developer needs — familiarity with SQL databases, preference for known programming languages, existing skill investments. &quot;That&#x27;s how the traditional tech stacks evolved. It&#x27;s really evolved to meet human needs,&quot; Williams explained. &quot;But in the future, it&#x27;s going to be different. You&#x27;re not going to care how the AI did it. Instead, for you, AI is the tech stack.&quot;</p><p>Caffeine&#x27;s architecture reflects this philosophy. Applications run entirely on the <a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/\"><u>Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)</u></a>, a blockchain-based network that Dfinity launched in May 2021 after raising over $100 million from investors including <a href=\"https://a16z.com/dfinity/\"><u>Andreessen Horowitz</u></a> and <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/29/dfinity/\"><u>Polychain Capital</u></a>. The ICP uses what Dfinity calls &quot;chain-key cryptography&quot; to create what Williams describes as &quot;tamper-proof&quot; code — applications that are mathematically guaranteed to execute their written logic without interference from traditional cyberattacks.</p><p>&quot;The code can&#x27;t be affected by ransomware, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about malware in the same way you do,&quot; Williams said. &quot;Configuration errors don&#x27;t result in traditional cyber attacks. That passive traditional cyber attacks isn&#x27;t something you need to worry about.&quot;</p><h2><b>How &#x27;orthogonal persistence&#x27; lets AI build apps without managing databases</b></h2><p>At the heart of Caffeine&#x27;s technical approach is a concept called &quot;<a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/fundamentals/actors/orthogonal-persistence/\"><u>orthogonal persistence</u></a>,&quot; which fundamentally reimagines how applications store and manage data. In traditional development, programmers must write extensive code to move data between application logic and separate database systems — marshaling data in and out of SQL servers, managing connections, handling synchronization.</p><p><a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/docs/motoko/home\"><u>Motoko</u></a> eliminates this entirely. Williams demonstrated with a simple example: defining a blog post data type and declaring a variable to store an array of posts requires just two lines of code. &quot;This declaration is all that&#x27;s necessary to have the blog maintain its list of posts,&quot; he explained during a presentation on the technology. &quot;Compare that to traditional IT where in order to persist the blog posts, you&#x27;d have to marshal them in and out of a database server. This is quite literally orders of magnitude more simple.&quot;</p><p>This abstraction allows AI to work at a higher conceptual level, focusing on application logic rather than infrastructure plumbing. &quot;Logic and data are kind of the same,&quot; Williams said. &quot;This is one of the things that enables AI to build far more complicated functionality than it could otherwise do.&quot;</p><p>The system also employs what Dfinity calls &quot;loss-safe data migration.&quot; When AI needs to modify an application&#x27;s data structure — adding a &quot;likes&quot; field to blog posts, for example — it must write migration logic in two passes. The framework automatically verifies that the transformation won&#x27;t result in data loss, refusing to compile or deploy code that could delete information unless explicitly instructed.</p><h2><b>From million-dollar SaaS contracts to conversational app building in minutes</b></h2><p>Williams positions <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a> as particularly transformative for enterprise IT, where he claims costs could fall to &quot;1% of what they were before&quot; while time-to-market shrinks to similar fractions. The platform targets a spectrum from individual creators to large corporations, all of whom currently face either expensive development teams or constraining low-code templates.</p><p>&quot;A corporation or government department might want to create a corporate portal or CRM, ERP functionality,&quot; Williams said, referring to customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems. &quot;They will otherwise have to obtain this by signing up for some incredibly expensive SaaS service where they become locked in, their data gets stuck, and they still have to spend a lot of money on consultants customizing the functionality.&quot;</p><p>Applications built through <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a> are owned entirely by their creators and cannot be shut down by centralized parties — a consequence of running on the decentralized <a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/\"><u>Internet Computer</u></a> network rather than traditional cloud providers like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/free/?trk=48ebaf74-0ade-44c7-b8c2-12a0e7718d21&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;ef_id=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!651751059777!e!!g!!amazon%20web%20services!19852662197!145019195737&amp;gad_campaignid=19852662197&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADjHtp-sA3cSfcBU924i9KU_I-qMh&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a5jTV7r4lhg4v2_akcje7Hv2RgfrbNK3YJRonxmzg3lQnhP5Dtop_waAscnEALw_wcB\"><u>Amazon Web Services</u></a>. &quot;When someone says built on the internet computer, it actually means built on the internet computer,&quot; Williams emphasized, contrasting this with blockchain projects that merely host tokens while running actual applications on centralized infrastructure.</p><p>The platform demonstrated this versatility during a July 2025 hackathon in San Francisco, where participants created applications ranging from a &quot;Will Maker&quot; tool for generating legal documents, to &quot;Blue Lens,&quot; a voice-AI water quality monitoring system, to &quot;Road Patrol,&quot; a gamified community reporting app for infrastructure problems. Critically, many of these came from non-technical participants with no coding background.</p><p>&quot;I&#x27;m from a non-technical background, I&#x27;m actually a quality assurance professional,&quot; said the creator of Blue Lens in a video testimonial. &quot;Through Caffeine I can build something really intuitive and next-gen to the public.&quot; The application integrated multiple external services — Eleven Labs for voice AI, real-time government water data through retrieval-augmented generation, and Midjourney-generated visual assets — all coordinated through conversational prompts.</p><h2><b>What separates Caffeine from GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and the &#x27;vibe coding&#x27; wave</b></h2><p><a href=\"http://caffeine.ai\"><u>Caffeine</u></a> enters a crowded market of AI-assisted development tools, but Williams argues the competition isn&#x27;t truly comparable. <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, <a href=\"https://cursor.com/\"><u>Cursor</u></a>, and similar tools serve human developers working with traditional technology stacks. Platforms like <a href=\"https://replit.com/\"><u>Replit</u></a> and <a href=\"https://lovable.dev/\"><u>Lovable</u></a> occupy a middle ground, offering &quot;vibe coding&quot; that mixes AI generation with human editing.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re a Node.js developer, you know you&#x27;re working with the traditional stack, and you might want to do your coding with Copilot or using Claude or using Cursor,&quot; Williams said. &quot;That&#x27;s a very different thing to what Caffeine is offering. There&#x27;ll always be cases where you probably wouldn&#x27;t want to hand over the logic of the control system for a new nuclear missile silo to AI. But there&#x27;s going to be these holdout areas, right? And there&#x27;s all the legacy stuff that has to be maintained.&quot;</p><p>The key distinction, according to Williams, lies in production readiness. Existing AI coding tools excel at rapid prototyping but stumble when applications grow complex or require guaranteed reliability. Reddit forums for these platforms document users hitting insurmountable walls where applications break irreparably, or where AI-generated code introduces security vulnerabilities.</p><p>&quot;As the demands and the requirements become more complicated, eventually you can hit a limit, and when you hit that limit, not only can you not go any further, but sometimes your app will get broken and there&#x27;s no way of going back to where you were before,&quot; Williams said. &quot;That can&#x27;t happen with productive apps, and it also can&#x27;t be the case that you&#x27;re getting hacked and losing data, because once you go hands-free, if you like, and there&#x27;s no tech team, there&#x27;s no technical people involved, who&#x27;s going to run the backups and restore your app?&quot;</p><p>The Internet Computer&#x27;s architecture addresses this through Byzantine fault tolerance — even if attackers gain physical control over some network hardware, they cannot corrupt applications or their data. &quot;This is the beginning of a compute revolution and it&#x27;s also the perfect platform for AI to build on,&quot; Williams said.</p><h2><b>Inside the vision: A web that programs itself through natural language</b></h2><p>Dfinity frames <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a> within a broader vision it calls the &quot;<a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>self-writing internet</u></a>,&quot; where the web literally programs itself through natural language interaction. This represents what Williams describes as a &quot;seismic shift coming to tech&quot; — from human developers selecting technology stacks based on their existing skills, to AI selecting optimal implementations invisible to users.</p><p>&quot;You don&#x27;t care about whether some human being has learned all of the different platforms and Amazon Web Services or something like that. You don&#x27;t care about that. You just care: Is it secure? Do you get security guarantees? Is it resilient? What&#x27;s the level of resilience?&quot; Williams said. &quot;Those are the new parameters.&quot;</p><p>The platform demonstrated this during live demonstrations, including at the <a href=\"https://worldcomputer.com/\"><u>World Computer Summit 2025</u></a> in Zurich. Williams created a talent recruitment application from scratch in under two minutes, then modified it in real-time while the application ran with users already interacting with it. &quot;You will continue talking to the AI and just keep on refreshing the URL to see the changes,&quot; he explained.</p><p>This capability extends to complex scenarios. During demonstrations, Williams showed building a tennis lesson booking system, an e-commerce platform, and an event registration system — all simultaneously, working on multiple applications in parallel. &quot;We predict that as people get very proficient with <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a>, they could be working on even 10 apps in parallel,&quot; he said.</p><p>The system writes substantial code: a simple personal blog generated 700 lines of code in a couple of minutes. More complex applications can involve thousands of lines across frontend and backend components, all abstracted away from the user who only describes desired functionality.</p><h2><b>The economics of cloning: How Caffeine&#x27;s app market challenges traditional stores</b></h2><p>Caffeine&#x27;s economic model differs fundamentally from traditional software-as-a-service platforms. Applications run on the <a href=\"https://internetcomputer.org/\"><u>Internet Computer Protocol</u></a>, which uses a &quot;reverse gas model&quot; where developers pay for computation rather than users paying transaction fees. The platform includes an integrated App Market where creators can publish applications for others to clone and adapt — creating what Dfinity envisions as a new economic ecosystem.</p><p>&quot;App stores today obviously operate on gatekeeping,&quot; said Pierre Samaties, chief business officer at Dfinity, during the World Computer Summit. &quot;That&#x27;s going to erode.&quot; Rather than purchasing applications, users can clone them and modify them for their own purposes — fundamentally different from Apple&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/app-store/\"><u>App Store</u></a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/games?hl=en_US\"><u>Google Play</u></a> models.</p><p>Williams acknowledges that <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a> itself currently runs on centralized infrastructure, despite building applications on the decentralized Internet Computer. &quot;Caffeine itself actually is centralized. It uses aspects of the Internet Computer. We want Caffeine itself to run on the Internet Computer in the future, but it&#x27;s not there now,&quot; he said. The platform leverages commercially available foundation models from companies like Anthropic, whose <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/claude/sonnet\"><u>Claude Sonnet</u></a> model powers much of Caffeine&#x27;s backend logic.</p><p>This pragmatic approach reflects Dfinity&#x27;s strategy of using best-in-class AI models while focusing its own development on the specialized infrastructure and programming language designed for AI use. &quot;These content models have been developed by companies with enormous budgets, absolutely enormous budgets,&quot; Williams said. &quot;I don&#x27;t think in the near future we&#x27;ll run AI on the Internet Computer for that reason, unless there&#x27;s a special case.&quot;</p><h2><b>A decade in the making: From Ethereum roots to the self-writing internet</b></h2><p>The <a href=\"https://dfinity.org/\"><u>Dfinity Foundation</u></a> has pursued this vision since Williams began researching decentralized networks in late 2013. After involvement with Ethereum before its 2015 launch, Williams became fascinated with the concept of a &quot;world computer&quot;—a public blockchain network that could host not just tokens but entire applications and services.</p><p>&quot;By 2015 I was talking about network-focused drivers, Dfinity back then, and that could really operate as an alternative tech stack, and eventually host even things like social networks and massive enterprise systems,&quot; Williams said. The foundation launched the Internet Computer Protocol in May 2021, initially focusing on Web3 developers. Despite not being among the highest-valued blockchain projects, ICP consistently ranks in the top 10 for developer numbers.</p><p>The pivot to AI-driven development came from recognizing that &quot;in the future, the tech stack will be AI,&quot; according to Williams. This realization led to Caffeine&#x27;s development, announced on Dfinity&#x27;s public roadmap in March 2025 and demonstrated at the <a href=\"https://worldcomputer.com/\"><u>World Computer Summit</u></a> in June 2025.</p><p>One successful example of the Dfinity vision running in production is <a href=\"https://oc.app/\"><u>OpenChat</u></a>, a messaging application that runs entirely on the Internet Computer and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) with tens of thousands of participants voting on source code updates through algorithmic governance. &quot;The community is actually controlling the source code updates,&quot; Williams explained. &quot;Developers propose updates, community reads the updates, and if the community is happy, OpenChat updates itself.&quot;</p><h2><b>The skeptics weigh in: Crypto baggage and real-world testing ahead</b></h2><p>The platform faces several challenges. Dfinity&#x27;s crypto industry roots may create perception problems in enterprise markets, Williams acknowledges. &quot;The Web3 industry&#x27;s reputation is a bit tarnished and probably rightfully so,&quot; he said during the World Computer Summit. &quot;Now people can, for themselves, experience what a decentralized network is. We&#x27;re going to see self-writing take over the enterprise space because the speed and efficiency are just incredible.&quot;</p><p>The foundation&#x27;s history includes controversy: ICP&#x27;s token launched in 2021 at over $100 per token with an all-time high around $700, then <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/dfinity-icp-ico.html\"><u>crashed below $3 in 2023</u></a> before recovering. The project has faced legal challenges, including class action lawsuits <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/business/dealbook/icp-cryptocurrency-crash.html\"><u>alleging misleading investors</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/column-new-york-times-crypto-analyst-beat-dfinity-defamation-claims-2023-11-14/\"><u>Dfinity filed defamation claims</u></a> against industry critics.</p><p>Technical limitations also remain. Caffeine cannot yet compile React front-ends on the Internet Computer itself, requiring some off-chain processing. Complex integrations with traditional systems — payment processing through Stripe, for example — still require centralized components. &quot;Your app is running end-to-end on the Internet Computer, then when it needs to actually accept payment, it&#x27;s going to hand over to your Stripe account,&quot; Williams explained.</p><p>The platform&#x27;s claims about data loss prevention and security guarantees, while technically grounded in the Motoko language design and Internet Computer architecture, remain to be tested at scale with diverse real-world applications. The 26% daily active user rate from alpha testing is impressive but comes from a self-selected group of early adopters.</p><h2><b>When five billion smartphone users become developers</b></h2><p>Williams rejects concerns that AI-driven development will eliminate software engineering jobs, arguing instead for market expansion. &quot;The self-writing internet empowers eight billion non-technical people,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of these people will enter roles in tech, becoming prompt engineers, tech entrepreneurs, or helping run online communities. Humanity will create millions of new custom apps and services, and a subset of those will require professional human assistance.&quot;</p><p>During his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_JleruySc\"><u>World Computer Summit demonstration</u></a>, Williams was explicit about the scale of transformation Dfinity envisions. &quot;Today there are about 35,000 Web3 engineers in the world. Worldwide there are about 15 million full-stack engineers,&quot; he said. &quot;But tomorrow with the self-writing internet, everyone will be a builder. Today there are already about five billion people with internet-connected smartphones and they&#x27;ll all be able to use Caffeine.&quot;</p><p>The hackathon results suggest this isn&#x27;t pure hyperbole. A dentist built &quot;Dental Tracks&quot; to help patients manage their dental records. A transportation industry professional created &quot;Road Patrol&quot; for gamified infrastructure reporting. A frustrated knitting student built &quot;Skill Sprout,&quot; a garden-themed app for learning new hobbies, complete with material checklists and step-by-step skill breakdowns—all without writing a single line of code.</p><p>&quot;I was learning to knit. I got irritated because I had the wrong materials,&quot; the creator explained in a video interview. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to do the stitches, so I have to individually search, and it&#x27;s really intimidating when you&#x27;re trying to learn something you don&#x27;t—you don&#x27;t even know what you don&#x27;t know.&quot;</p><p>Whether <a href=\"https://caffeine.ai/\"><u>Caffeine</u></a> succeeds depends on factors still unknown: how production applications perform under real-world stress, whether the Internet Computer scales to millions of applications, whether enterprises can overcome their skepticism of blockchain-adjacent technology. But if Williams is right about the fundamental shift — that AI will be the tech stack, not just a tool for human developers — then someone will build what Caffeine promises.</p><p>The question isn&#x27;t whether the future looks like this. It&#x27;s who gets there first, and whether they can do it without losing everyone&#x27;s data along the way.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Automation</category>\n            <category>technology</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4KtYR3vJAj9O1BxMtYqm9e/aad83e291aadf8fd2f12e6cf45aeede9/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_coffee_made_of_computer_code_87b3e7a8-f103-4de0-ae47-d17717e023f9.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[EAGLET boosts AI agent performance on longer-horizon tasks by generating custom plans]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/eaglet-boosts-ai-agent-performance-on-longer-horizon-tasks-by-generating</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5iy9dF7GqxrBrIbRZEfkgB</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 22:27:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>2025 was supposed to be<a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-ceo-ai-agents-8c20ddfb?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjLKLIimw5qFdsG0kmEnu-fOoNZXVCdnBx-zn_CbT1hLgiWcYGxmHLDOvPxpV0%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68eec9d8&amp;gaa_sig=klyxA4QUo1K8AN8hu1LEL8i64tGtj_jKhoX1IWR32Fm06Aizm1ylHYCER9fv8FSpylAwqgIuRsbIeYlPFmAebA%3D%3D\"> the year of &quot;AI agents,&quot;</a> according to Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and other AI industry personnel. And it has been, in many ways, with numerous leading AI model providers such as <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-unveils-chatgpt-agent-that-gives-chatgpt-its-own-computer-to-autonomously-use-your-email-and-web-apps-download-and-create-files-for-you\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-ai-can-now-surf-the-web-for-you-click-on-buttons-and-fill-out-forms\">Google</a>, and even Chinese competitors like <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-deepseek-moment-for-ai-agents-is-here-meet-alibabas-open-source-tongyi\">Alibaba releasing</a> fine-tuned AI models or applications designed to focus on a narrow set of tasks, such as web search and report writing. </p><p>But one big hurdle to a future of highly performant, reliable, AI agents remains: getting them to stay on task when the task extends over a number of steps.<a href=\"https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/\"> Third-party benchmark tests </a>show even the most powerful AI models experience higher failure rates the more steps they take to complete a task, and the longer time they spend on it (exceeding hours). </p><p>A <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers/2510.05608\">new academic framework called EAGLET</a> proposes a practical and efficient method to improve long-horizon task performance in LLM-based agents — without the need for manual data labeling or retraining. </p><p>Developed by researchers from Tsinghua University, Peking University, DeepLang AI, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,<b> EAGLET offers a &quot;global planner&quot; that can be integrated into existing agent workflows to reduce hallucinations and improve task efficiency.</b></p><p>EAGLET is a fine-tuned language model that interprets task instructions — typically provided as prompts by the user or the agent&#x27;s operating environment — and generates a high-level plan for the agent (powered by its own LLM). It does not intervene during execution, but its up-front guidance helps reduce planning errors and improve task completion rates.</p><h3><b>Addressing the Planning Problem in Long-Horizon Agents</b></h3><p>Many LLM-based agents struggle with long-horizon tasks because they rely on reactive, step-by-step reasoning. This approach often leads to trial-and-error behavior, planning hallucinations, and inefficient trajectories. </p><p>EAGLET tackles this limitation by introducing a <b>global planning module</b> that works alongside the executor agent. </p><p>Instead of blending planning and action generation in a single model, EAGLET separates them, enabling more coherent, task-level strategies.</p><h3><b>A Two-Stage Training Pipeline with No Human Annotations</b></h3><p>EAGLET’s planner is trained using a two-stage process that requires no human-written plans or annotations. </p><p>The first stage involves generating synthetic plans with high-capability LLMs, such as GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3.1-Think. </p><p>These plans are then filtered using a novel strategy called homologous consensus filtering, which retains only those that improve task performance for both expert and novice executor agents. </p><p>In the second stage, a rule-based reinforcement learning process further refines the planner, using a custom-designed reward function to assess how much each plan helps multiple agents succeed.</p><h3><b>Introducing the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR)</b></h3><p>One of EAGLET’s key innovations is the Executor Capability Gain Reward (ECGR). </p><p>This reward measures the value of a generated plan by checking whether it helps both high- and low-capability agents complete tasks more successfully and with fewer steps. </p><p>It also includes a decay factor to favor shorter, more efficient task trajectories. This approach avoids over-rewarding plans that are only useful to already-competent agents and promotes more generalizable planning guidance.</p><h3><b>Compatible with Existing Agents and Models</b></h3><p>The EAGLET planner is designed to be modular and &quot;plug-and-play,&quot; meaning it can be inserted into existing agent pipelines without requiring executor retraining. </p><p>In evaluations, the planner boosted performance across a variety of foundational models, including GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Llama-3.1, and Qwen2.5. </p><p>It also proved effective regardless of prompting strategy, working well with standard ReAct-style prompts as well as approaches like Reflexion.</p><h3><b>State-of-the-Art Performance Across Benchmarks</b></h3><p>EAGLET was tested on three widely used benchmarks for long-horizon agent tasks: ScienceWorld, which simulates scientific experiments in a text-based lab environment; ALFWorld, which tasks agents with completing household activities through natural language in a simulated home setting; and WebShop, which evaluates goal-driven behavior in a realistic online shopping interface.</p><p>Across all three, executor agents equipped with EAGLET outperformed their non-planning counterparts and other planning baselines, including MPO and KnowAgent. </p><p>In experiments with the open source Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model, EAGLET boosted average performance from 39.5 to 59.4, a +19.9 point gain across tasks. </p><p>On ScienceWorld unseen scenarios, it raised performance from 42.2 to 61.6. </p><p>In ALFWorld seen scenarios, EAGLET improved outcomes from 22.9 to 54.3, a more than 2.3× increase in performance.</p><p>Even stronger gains were seen with more capable models. </p><p>For instance, GPT-4.1 improved from 75.5 to 82.2 average score with EAGLET, and GPT-5 rose from 84.5 to 88.1, despite already being strong performers. </p><p>In some benchmarks, performance gains were as high as +11.8 points, such as when combining EAGLET with the ETO executor method on ALFWorld unseen tasks.</p><p>Compared to other planning baselines like MPO, EAGLET consistently delivered higher task completion rates. For example, on ALFWorld unseen tasks with GPT-4.1, MPO achieved 79.1, while EAGLET scored 83.6—a +4.5 point advantage.</p><p>Additionally, the paper reports that agents using EAGLET complete tasks in fewer steps on average. With GPT-4.1 as executor, average step count dropped from 13.0 (no planner) to 11.1 (EAGLET). With GPT-5, it dropped from 11.4 to 9.4, supporting the claim of improved execution efficiency.</p><h3><b>Efficiency Gains in Training and Execution</b></h3><p>Compared to RL-based methods like GiGPO, which can require hundreds of training iterations, EAGLET achieved better or comparable results with roughly one-eighth the training effort. </p><p>This efficiency also carries over into execution: agents using EAGLET typically needed fewer steps to complete tasks. This translates into reduced inference time and compute cost in production scenarios.</p><h3><b>No Public Code—Yet</b></h3><p>As of the version submitted to arXiv, the authors have not released an open-source implementation of EAGLET. It is unclear if or when the code will be released, under what license, or how it will be maintained, which may limit the near-term utility of the framework for enterprise deployment. </p><p>VentureBeat has reached out to the authors to clarify these points and will update this piece when we hear back.</p><h3><b>Enterprise Deployment Questions Remain</b></h3><p>While the planner is described as plug-and-play, it remains unclear whether EAGLET can be easily integrated into popular enterprise agent frameworks such as LangChain or AutoGen, or if it requires a custom stack to support plan-execute separation. </p><p>Similarly, the training setup leverages multiple executor agents, which may be difficult to replicate in enterprise environments with limited model access. VentureBeat has asked the researchers whether the homologous consensus filtering method can be adapted for teams that only have access to one executor model or limited compute resources.</p><p>EAGLET’s authors report success across model types and sizes, but it is not yet known what the minimal viable model scale is for practical deployment. For example, can enterprise teams use the planner effectively with sub-10B parameter open models in latency-sensitive environments? Additionally, the framework may offer industry-specific value in domains like customer support or IT automation, but it remains to be seen how easily the planner can be fine-tuned or customized for such verticals.</p><h3><b>Real-Time vs. Pre-Generated Planning</b></h3><p>Another open question is how EAGLET is best deployed in practice. Should the planner operate in real-time alongside executors within a loop, or is it better used offline to pre-generate global plans for known task types? Each approach has implications for latency, cost, and operational complexity. VentureBeat has posed this question to the authors and will report any insights that emerge.</p><h3><b>Strategic Tradeoffs for Enterprise Teams</b></h3><p>For technical leaders at medium-to-large enterprises, EAGLET represents a compelling proof of concept for improving the reliability and efficiency of LLM agents. But without public tooling or implementation guidelines, the framework still presents a build-versus-wait decision. Enterprises must weigh the potential gains in task performance and efficiency against the costs of reproducing or approximating the training process in-house.</p><h3><b>Potential Use Cases in Enterprise Settings</b></h3><p>For enterprises developing agentic AI systems—especially in environments requiring stepwise planning, such as IT automation, customer support, or online interactions—EAGLET offers a template for how to incorporate planning without retraining. Its ability to guide both open- and closed-source models, along with its efficient training method, may make it an appealing starting point for teams seeking to improve agent performance with minimal overhead.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/1FsFs77cl1uzCE3JPEBnrk/7541c62def835191ff404046af4030c7/cfr0z3n_graphic_novel_hyper_detailed_close_up_on_a_cybernetic_b_9624e28f-5392-4c92-a115-0520c6058152.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Visa just launched a protocol to secure the AI shopping boom — here’s what it means for merchants]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/visa-just-launched-a-protocol-to-secure-the-ai-shopping-boom-heres-what-it</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3PRiaZhGuVoFa2SxzK9YmW</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/\"><u>Visa</u></a> is introducing a new security framework designed to solve one of the thorniest problems emerging in artificial intelligence-powered commerce: how retailers can tell the difference between legitimate AI shopping assistants and the malicious bots that plague their websites.</p><p>The payments giant unveiled its <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/trusted-agent-protocol/docs#:~:text=The%20Trusted%20Agent%20Protocol%3A%20This,for%20validating%20an%20agent&#x27;s%20intent.\"><u>Trusted Agent Protocol</u></a> on Tuesday, establishing what it describes as foundational infrastructure for &quot;agentic commerce&quot; — a term for the rapidly growing practice of consumers delegating shopping tasks to AI agents that can search products, compare prices, and complete purchases autonomously.</p><p>The protocol enables merchants to cryptographically verify that an AI agent browsing their site is authorized and trustworthy, rather than a bot designed to scrape pricing data, test stolen credit cards, or carry out other fraudulent activities.</p><p>The launch comes as AI-driven traffic to U.S. retail websites has <a href=\"https://business.adobe.com/resources/holiday-shopping-report.html\"><u>exploded by more than 4,700%</u></a> over the past year, according to data from Adobe cited by Visa. That dramatic surge has created an acute challenge for merchants whose existing bot detection systems — designed to block automated traffic — now risk accidentally blocking legitimate AI shoppers along with bad actors.</p><p>&quot;Merchants need additional tools that provide them with greater insight and transparency into agentic commerce activities to ensure they can participate safely,&quot; said Rubail Birwadker, Visa&#x27;s Global Head of Growth, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;Without common standards, potential risks include ecosystem fragmentation and the proliferation of closed loop models.&quot;</p><p>The stakes are substantial. While 85% of shoppers who have used AI to shop report improved experiences, merchants face the prospect of either turning away legitimate AI-powered customers or exposing themselves to sophisticated bot attacks. Visa&#x27;s own data shows the company <a href=\"https://usa.visa.com/about-visa/newsroom/press-releases.releaseId.20661.html\"><u>prevented $40 billion in fraudulent activity</u></a> between October 2022 and September 2023, nearly double the previous year, much of it involving AI-powered enumeration attacks where bots systematically test combinations of card numbers until finding valid credentials.</p><h2><b>Inside the cryptographic handshake: How Visa verifies AI shopping agents</b></h2><p>Visa&#x27;s <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/trusted-agent-protocol/docs#:~:text=The%20Trusted%20Agent%20Protocol%3A%20This,for%20validating%20an%20agent%27s%20intent.\"><u>Trusted Agent Protocol</u></a> operates through what Birwadker describes as a &quot;cryptographic trust handshake&quot; between merchants and approved AI agents. The system works in three steps:</p><p>First, AI agents must be approved and onboarded through Visa&#x27;s <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/visa-intelligent-commerce\"><u>Intelligent Commerce</u></a> program, where they undergo vetting to meet trust and reliability standards. Each approved agent receives a unique digital signature key — essentially a cryptographic credential that proves its identity.</p><p>When an approved agent visits a merchant&#x27;s website, it creates a digital signature using its key and transmits three categories of information: Agent Intent (indicating the agent is trusted and intends to retrieve product details or make a purchase), Consumer Recognition (data showing whether the underlying consumer has an existing account with the merchant), and Payment Information (optional payment data to support checkout).</p><p>Merchants or their infrastructure providers, such as content delivery networks, then validate these digital signatures against Visa&#x27;s registry of approved agents. &quot;Upon proper validation of these fields, the merchant can confirm the signature is a trusted agent,&quot; Birwadker explained.</p><p>Crucially, Visa designed the protocol to require minimal changes to existing merchant infrastructure. Built on the <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9421\"><u>HTTP Message Signature standard</u></a> and aligned with <a href=\"https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/reference/bot-verification/web-bot-auth/\"><u>Web Both Auth</u></a>, the protocol works with existing web infrastructure without requiring merchants to overhaul their checkout pages. &quot;This is no-code functionality,&quot; Birwadker emphasized, though merchants may need to integrate with Visa&#x27;s Developer Center to access the verification system.</p><h2><b>The race for AI commerce standards: Visa faces competition from Google, OpenAI, and Stripe</b></h2><p>Visa developed the protocol in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\"><u>Cloudflare</u></a>, the web infrastructure and security company that already provides bot management services to millions of websites. The partnership reflects Visa&#x27;s recognition that solving bot verification requires cooperation across the entire web stack, not just the payments layer.</p><p>&quot;Trusted Agent Protocol supplements traditional bot management by providing merchants insights that enable agentic commerce,&quot; Birwadker said. &quot;Agents are providing additional context they otherwise would not, including what it intends to do, who the underlying consumer is, and payment information.&quot;</p><p>The protocol arrives as multiple technology giants race to establish competing standards for AI commerce. Google recently introduced its <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-agents-to-payments-ap2-protocol\"><u>Agent Protocol for Payments (AP2)</u></a>, while <a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> and <a href=\"https://stripe.com/\"><u>Stripe</u></a> have discussed their own approaches to enabling AI agents to make purchases. Microsoft, Shopify, Adyen, Ant International, Checkout.com, Cybersource, Elavon, Fiserv, Nuvei, and Worldpay provided feedback during Trusted Agent Protocol&#x27;s development, according to Visa.</p><p>When asked how Visa&#x27;s protocol relates to these competing efforts, Birwadker struck a collaborative tone. &quot;Both Google&#x27;s AP2 and Visa&#x27;s Trusted Agent Protocol are working toward the same goal of building trust in agent-initiated payments,&quot; he said. &quot;We are engaged with Google, OpenAI, and Stripe and are looking to create compatibility across the ecosystem.&quot;</p><p>Visa says it is working with global standards bodies including the <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/\"><u>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</u></a>, <a href=\"https://openid.net/foundation/\"><u>OpenID Foundation</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.emvco.com/\"><u>EMVCo</u></a> to ensure the protocol can eventually become interoperable with other emerging standards. &quot;While these specifications apply to the Visa network in this initial phase, enabling agents to safely and securely act on a consumer&#x27;s behalf requires an open, ecosystem-wide approach,&quot; Birwadker noted.</p><h2><b>Who pays when AI agents go rogue? Unanswered questions about liability and authorization</b></h2><p>The protocol raises important questions about authorization and liability when AI agents make purchases on behalf of consumers. If an agent completes an unauthorized transaction — perhaps misunderstanding a user&#x27;s intent or exceeding its delegated authority — who bears responsibility?</p><p>Birwadker emphasized that the protocol helps merchants &quot;leverage this information to enable experiences tied to existing consumer relationships and more secure checkout,&quot; but he did not provide specific details about how disputes would be handled when agents make unauthorized purchases. Visa&#x27;s existing fraud protection and chargeback systems would presumably apply, though the company has not yet published detailed guidance on agent-initiated transaction disputes.</p><p>The protocol also places Visa in the position of gatekeeper for the emerging agentic commerce ecosystem. Because Visa determines which AI agents get approved for the <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com/capabilities/visa-intelligent-commerce\"><u>Intelligent Commerce</u></a> program and receive cryptographic credentials, the company effectively controls which agents merchants can easily trust. &quot;Agents are approved and onboarded through the Visa Intelligent Commerce program, ensuring they meet our standards for trust and reliability,&quot; Birwadker said, though he did not detail the specific criteria agents must meet or whether Visa charges fees for approval.</p><p>This gatekeeping role could prove contentious, particularly if Visa&#x27;s approval process favors large technology companies over startups, or if the company faces pressure to block agents from competitors or politically controversial entities. Visa declined to provide details about how many agents it has approved so far or how long the vetting process typically takes.</p><h2><b>Visa&#x27;s legal battles and the long road to merchant adoption</b></h2><p>The protocol launch comes at a complex moment for Visa, which continues to navigate significant legal and regulatory challenges even as its core business remains robust. The company&#x27;s latest <a href=\"https://investor.visa.com/financial-information/quarterly-earnings/\"><u>earnings report</u></a> for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025 showed a 10% increase in net revenues to $9.2 billion, driven by resilient consumer spending and strong growth in cross-border transaction volume. For the full fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, Visa processed 289 billion transactions, with a total payments volume of $15.2 trillion.</p><p>\n</p><p>However, the company&#x27;s legal headwinds have intensified. In July 2025, a federal judge rejected a landmark <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-rejects-visa-mastercard-30-bln-swipe-fee-settlement-2024-06-25/\"><u>$30 billion settlement</u></a> that Visa and Mastercard had reached with merchants over long-disputed credit card swipe fees, sending the parties back to the negotiating table and extending the long-running legal battle.</p><p>Simultaneously, <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-visa-monopolizing-debit-markets\"><u>Visa remains under investigation by the Department of Justice</u></a> over its rules for routing debit card transactions, with regulators scrutinizing whether the company&#x27;s practices unlawfully limit merchant choice and stifle competition. These domestic challenges are mirrored abroad, where European regulators have continued their own antitrust investigations into the fee structures of both Visa and its primary competitor, Mastercard.</p><p>Against this backdrop of regulatory pressure, Birwadker acknowledged that adoption of the Trusted Agent Protocol will take time. &quot;As agentic commerce continues to rise, we recognize that consumer trust is still in its early stages,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s why our focus through 2025 is on building foundational credibility and demonstrating real-world value.&quot;</p><p>The protocol is available immediately in <a href=\"https://developer.visa.com/\"><u>Visa&#x27;s Developer Center</u></a> and on <a href=\"https://github.com/visa\"><u>GitHub</u></a>, with agent onboarding already active and merchant integration resources available. But Birwadker declined to provide specific targets for how many merchants might adopt the protocol by the end of 2026. &quot;Adoption is aligned with the momentum we&#x27;re already seeing,&quot; he said. &quot;The launch of our protocol marks another big step — it&#x27;s not just a technical milestone, but a signal that the industry is beginning to unify.&quot;</p><p>Industry analysts say merchant adoption will likely depend on how quickly agentic commerce grows as a percentage of overall e-commerce. While AI-driven traffic has surged dramatically, much of that consists of agents browsing and researching rather than completing purchases. If AI agents begin accounting for a significant share of completed transactions, merchants will face stronger incentives to adopt verification systems like Visa&#x27;s protocol.</p><h2><b>From fraud detection to AI gatekeeping: Visa&#x27;s $10 billion bet on artificial intelligence</b></h2><p>Visa&#x27;s move reflects broader strategic bets on AI across the financial services industry. The company has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/ai-and-machine-learning-helped-visa-combat-40-billion-in-fraud-activity.html\"><u>invested $10 billion in technology</u></a> over the past five years to reduce fraud and increase network security, with AI and machine learning central to those efforts. Visa&#x27;s fraud detection system analyzes over 500 different attributes for each transaction, using AI models to assign real-time risk scores to the 300 billion annual transactions flowing through its network.</p><p>&quot;Every single one of those transactions has been processed by AI,&quot; James Mirfin, Visa&#x27;s global head of risk and identity solutions, said in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/26/ai-and-machine-learning-helped-visa-combat-40-billion-in-fraud-activity.html\"><u>July 2024 CNBC interview</u></a> discussing the company&#x27;s fraud prevention efforts. &quot;If you see a new type of fraud happening, our model will see that, it will catch it, it will score those transactions as high risk and then our customers can decide not to approve those transactions.&quot;</p><p>The company has also moved aggressively into new payment territories beyond its core card business. In January 2025, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/elon-musk-x-visa-digital-wallet.html\"><u>Visa partnered with Elon Musk&#x27;s X</u></a> (formerly Twitter) to provide the infrastructure for a digital wallet and peer-to-peer payment service called the X Money Account, competing with services like Venmo and Zelle. That deal marked Visa&#x27;s first major partnership in the social media payments space and reflected the company&#x27;s recognition that payment flows are increasingly happening outside traditional e-commerce channels.</p><p>The agentic commerce protocol represents an extension of this strategy — an attempt to ensure Visa remains central to payment flows even as the mechanics of shopping shift from direct human interaction to AI intermediation. <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/visa-launches-intelligent-commerce-platform-letting-ai-agents-swipe-your-card-safely-it-says\"><u>Jack Forestell</u></a>, Visa&#x27;s Chief Product &amp; Strategy Officer, framed the protocol in expansive terms: &quot;We believe the entire payments ecosystem has a responsibility to ensure sellers trust AI agents with the same confidence they place in their most valued customers and networks.&quot;</p><h2><b>The coming battle for control of AI shopping</b></h2><p>The real test for Visa&#x27;s protocol won&#x27;t be technical — it will be political. As AI agents become a larger force in retail, whoever controls the verification infrastructure controls access to hundreds of billions of dollars in commerce. Visa&#x27;s position as gatekeeper gives it enormous leverage, but also makes it a target.</p><p>Merchants chafing under Visa&#x27;s existing fee structure and facing multiple antitrust investigations may resist ceding even more power to the payments giant. Competitors like Google and OpenAI, each with their own ambitions in commerce, have little incentive to let Visa dictate standards. Regulators already scrutinizing Visa&#x27;s market dominance will surely examine whether its agent approval process unfairly advantages certain players.</p><p>And there&#x27;s a deeper question lurking beneath the technical specifications and corporate partnerships: In an economy increasingly mediated by AI, who decides which algorithms get to spend our money? Visa is making an aggressive bid to be that arbiter, wrapping its answer in the language of security and interoperability. Whether merchants, consumers, and regulators accept that proposition will determine not just the fate of the Trusted Agent Protocol, but the structure of AI-powered commerce itself.</p><p>For now, Visa is moving forward with the confidence of a company that has weathered disruption before. But in the emerging world of agentic commerce, being too trusted might prove just as dangerous as not being trusted enough.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Data Infrastructure</category>\n            <category>Security</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4TWzzYHcsJXmxU7VYnIlKV/896cc598ae137fe841c13309d6aae3df/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_a_Visa_credit_card_c3c9580a-d8ce-4402-9763-bd56dc26549e.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Self-improving language models are becoming reality with MIT's updated SEAL technique]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/self-improving-language-models-are-becoming-reality-with-mits-updated-seal</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">2DZeBp6S1jKWp6XepsEvCX</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 22:51:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are gaining renewed attention for developing and <a href=\"https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL/blob/main/LICENSE\">open sourcing</a> a technique that allows large language models (LLMs) — like those underpinning ChatGPT and most modern AI chatbots — to improve themselves by generating synthetic data to fine-tune upon. </p><p>The technique, known as SEAL (Self-Adapting LLMs), was first described in a paper published back in June and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-static-ai-mits-new-framework-lets-models-teach-themselves\">covered by VentureBeat at the time.</a></p><p>A significantly expanded and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943\">updated version of the paper was released last month</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL\">open source code posted on Github</a> (under an MIT License, allowing for commercial and enterprise usage), and is making new waves among AI power users on the social network X this week.</p><p>SEAL allows LLMs to autonomously generate and apply their own fine-tuning strategies. Unlike conventional models that rely on fixed external data and human-crafted optimization pipelines, SEAL enables models to evolve by producing their own synthetic training data and corresponding optimization directives.</p><p>The development comes from a team affiliated with MIT’s Improbable AI Lab, including Adam Zweiger, Jyothish Pari, Han Guo, Ekin Akyürek, Yoon Kim, and Pulkit Agrawal. Their research was recently presented at the 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025).</p><h3><b>Background: From “Beyond Static AI” to Self-Adaptive Systems</b></h3><p>Earlier this year, VentureBeat first reported on SEAL as an early-stage framework that allowed language models to generate and train on their own synthetic data — a potential remedy for the stagnation of pretrained models once deployed. </p><p>At that stage, SEAL was framed as a proof-of-concept that could let enterprise AI agents continuously learn in dynamic environments without manual retraining.</p><p>Since then, the research has advanced considerably. The new version expands on the prior framework by demonstrating that SEAL’s self-adaptation ability scales with model size, integrates reinforcement learning more effectively to reduce catastrophic forgetting, and formalizes SEAL’s dual-loop structure (inner supervised fine-tuning and outer reinforcement optimization) for reproducibility. </p><p>The updated paper also introduces evaluations across different prompting formats, improved stability during learning cycles, and a discussion of practical deployment challenges at inference time.</p><h3><b>Addressing the Limitations of Static Models</b></h3><p>While LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in text generation and understanding, their adaptation to new tasks or knowledge is often manual, brittle, or dependent on context. </p><p>SEAL challenges this status quo by equipping models with the ability to generate what the authors call “self-edits” — natural language outputs that specify how the model should update its weights.</p><p>These self-edits may take the form of reformulated information, logical implications, or tool configurations for augmentation and training. Once generated, the model fine-tunes itself based on these edits. The process is guided by reinforcement learning, where the reward signal comes from improved performance on a downstream task.</p><p>The design mimics how human learners might rephrase or reorganize study materials to better internalize information. This restructuring of knowledge before assimilation serves as a key advantage over models that passively consume new data “as-is.”</p><h3><b>Performance Across Tasks</b></h3><p>SEAL has been tested across two main domains: knowledge incorporation and few-shot learning.</p><p>In the knowledge incorporation setting, the researchers evaluated how well a model could internalize new factual content from passages similar to those in the SQuAD dataset, a benchmark reading comprehension dataset introduced by Stanford University in 2016, consisting of over 100,000 crowd-sourced question–answer pairs based on Wikipedia articles (Rajpurkar et al., 2016). </p><p>Rather than fine-tuning directly on passage text, <b>the model generated synthetic implications of the passage</b> and then fine-tuned on them. </p><p>After two rounds of reinforcement learning, the model improved question-answering accuracy from 33.5% to 47.0% on a no-context version of SQuAD — surpassing results obtained using synthetic data generated by GPT-4.1.</p><p>In the few-shot learning setting, SEAL was evaluated using a subset of the ARC benchmark, where tasks require reasoning from only a few examples. Here, SEAL generated self-edits specifying data augmentations and hyperparameters. </p><p>After reinforcement learning,<b> the success rate in correctly solving held-out tasks jumped to 72.5%, up from 20% using self-edits generated without reinforcement learning. </b>Models that relied solely on in-context learning without any adaptation scored 0%.</p><h3><b>Technical Framework</b></h3><p>SEAL operates using a two-loop structure: an inner loop performs supervised fine-tuning based on the self-edit, while an outer loop uses reinforcement learning to refine the policy that generates those self-edits.</p><p>The reinforcement learning algorithm used is based on ReSTEM, which combines sampling with filtered behavior cloning. During training, only self-edits that lead to performance improvements are reinforced. This approach effectively teaches the model which kinds of edits are most beneficial for learning.</p><p>For efficiency, SEAL applies LoRA-based fine-tuning rather than full parameter updates, enabling rapid experimentation and low-cost adaptation.</p><h3><b>Strengths and Limitations</b></h3><p>The researchers report that SEAL can produce high-utility training data with minimal supervision, outperforming even large external models like GPT-4.1 in specific tasks. </p><p>They also demonstrate that SEAL generalizes beyond its original setup: it continues to perform well when scaling from single-pass updates to multi-document continued pretraining scenarios.</p><p>However, the framework is not without limitations. One issue is catastrophic forgetting, where updates to incorporate new information can degrade performance on previously learned tasks. </p><p>In response to this concern, co-author Jyo Pari told VentureBeat via email that reinforcement learning (RL) appears to mitigate forgetting more effectively than standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), citing a recent paper on the topic. He added that combining this insight with SEAL could lead to new variants where SEAL learns not just training data, but reward functions.</p><p>Another challenge is computational overhead: evaluating each self-edit requires fine-tuning and performance testing, which can take 30–45 seconds per edit — significantly more than standard reinforcement learning tasks. </p><p>As Jyo explained, “Training SEAL is non-trivial because it requires 2 loops of optimization, an outer RL one and an inner SFT one. At inference time, updating model weights will also require new systems infrastructure.” He emphasized the need for future research into deployment systems as a critical path to making SEAL practical.</p><p>Additionally, SEAL’s current design assumes the presence of paired tasks and reference answers for every context, limiting its direct applicability to unlabeled corpora. However, Jyo clarified that as long as there is a downstream task with a computable reward, SEAL can be trained to adapt accordingly—even in safety-critical domains. In principle, a SEAL-trained model could learn to avoid training on harmful or malicious inputs if guided by the appropriate reward signal.</p><h3><b>AI Community Reactions</b></h3><p>The AI research and builder community has reacted with a mix of excitement and speculation to the SEAL paper. On X, formerly Twitter, several prominent AI-focused accounts weighed in on the potential impact.</p><p>User <a href=\"https://x.com/VraserX/status/1977270686285459482\">@VraserX</a>, a self-described educator and AI enthusiast, called SEAL “the birth of continuous self-learning AI” and predicted that models like OpenAI&#x27;s GPT-6 could adopt similar architecture. </p><p>In their words, SEAL represents “the end of the frozen-weights era,” ushering in systems that evolve as the world around them changes. </p><p>They highlighted SEAL&#x27;s ability to form persistent memories, repair knowledge, and learn from real-time data, comparing it to a foundational step toward models that don’t just use information but absorb it.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://x.com/alex_prompter/status/1977633849879527877\">@alex_prompter</a>, co-founder of an AI-powered marketing venture, framed SEAL as a leap toward models that literally rewrite themselves. “MIT just built an AI that can rewrite its own code to get smarter,” he wrote. <b>Citing the paper’s key results — a 40% boost in factual recall and outperforming GPT-4.1 using self-generated data </b>— he described the findings as confirmation that “LLMs that finetune themselves are no longer sci-fi.”</p><p>The enthusiasm reflects a broader appetite in the AI space for models that can evolve without constant retraining or human oversight — particularly in rapidly changing domains or personalized use cases.</p><h3><b>Future Directions and Open Questions</b></h3><p>In response to questions about scaling SEAL to larger models and tasks, Jyo pointed to experiments (Appendix B.7) showing that as model size increases, so does their self-adaptation ability. He compared this to students improving their study techniques over time — larger models are simply better at generating useful self-edits.</p><p>When asked whether SEAL generalizes to new prompting styles, he confirmed it does, citing Table 10 in the paper. However, he also acknowledged that the team has not yet tested SEAL’s ability to transfer across entirely new domains or model architectures. </p><p>“SEAL is an initial work showcasing the possibilities,” he said. “But it requires much more testing.” He added that generalization may improve as SEAL is trained on a broader distribution of tasks.</p><p>Interestingly, the team found that only a few reinforcement learning steps already led to measurable performance gains. “This is exciting,” Jyo noted, “because it means that with more compute, we could hopefully get even more improvements.” He suggested future experiments could explore more advanced reinforcement learning methods beyond ReSTEM, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).</p><h3><b>Toward More Adaptive and Agentic Models</b></h3><p>SEAL represents a step toward models that can autonomously improve over time, both by integrating new knowledge and by reconfiguring how they learn. The authors envision future extensions where SEAL could assist in self-pretraining, continual learning, and the development of agentic systems — models that interact with evolving environments and adapt incrementally.</p><p>In such settings, a model could use SEAL to synthesize weight updates after each interaction, gradually internalizing behaviors or insights. This could reduce the need for repeated supervision and manual intervention, particularly in data-constrained or specialized domains.</p><p>As public web text becomes saturated and further scaling of LLMs becomes bottlenecked by data availability, self-directed approaches like SEAL could play a critical role in pushing the boundaries of what LLMs can achieve.</p><p>You can access the SEAL project, including code and further documentation, at: <a href=\"https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal\">https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal</a></p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4816Y0YfsXKIENLGFsuaG6/a4620bd99d25c8fe32ab054bd16ff390/cfr0z3n_a_cybernetic_seal_looks_up_with_cute_alert_eyes_under_a_a6f43d56-7792-4d4f-bc1e-18b6dd2f5e4e.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Researchers find that retraining only small parts of AI models can cut costs and prevent forgetting]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/researchers-find-that-retraining-only-small-parts-of-ai-models-can-cut-costs</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">9ub9qux7wcykInsZ8hUqB</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 22:39:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Enterprises often find that when <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/fine-tuning-vs-in-context-learning-new-research-guides-better-llm-customization-for-real-world-tasks\"><u>they fine-tune models</u></a>, one effective approach to making a large language model (LLM) fit for purpose and grounded in data is to have the model lose some of its abilities. After fine-tuning, some models “forget” how to perform certain tasks or other tasks they already learned. </p><p>Research from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign proposes a new method for retraining models that avoids “catastrophic forgetting,” in which the model loses some of its prior knowledge. The paper focuses on two specific LLMs that generate responses from images: LLaVA and Qwen 2.5-VL.</p><p>The approach encourages enterprises to retrain only narrow parts of an LLM to avoid retraining the entire model and incurring a significant increase in compute costs. The team claims that catastrophic forgetting isn’t true memory loss, but rather a side effect of bias drift. </p><p>“Training a new LMM can cost millions of dollars, weeks of time, and emit hundreds of tons of CO2, so finding ways to more efficiently and effectively update existing models is a pressing concern,” the team wrote in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08564\"><u>paper</u></a>. “Guided by this result, we explore tuning recipes that preserve learning while limiting output shift.”</p><p>The researchers focused on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), the model&#x27;s internal decision-making component. \n</p><h2>Catastrophic forgetting </h2><p>The researchers wanted first to verify the existence and the cause of catastrophic forgetting in models. </p><p>To do this, they created a set of target tasks for the models to complete. The models were then fine-tuned and evaluated to determine whether they led to substantial forgetting. But as the process went on, the researchers found that the models were recovering some of their abilities. </p><p>“We also noticed a surprising result, that the model performance would drop significantly in held out benchmarks after training on the counting task, it would mostly recover on PathVQA, another specialized task that is not well represented in the benchmarks,” they said. “Meanwhile, while performing the forgetting mitigation experiments, we also tried separately tuning only the self-attention projection (SA Proj) or MLP layers, motivated by the finding that tuning only the LLM was generally better than tuning the full model. This led to another very surprising result – that tuning only self-attention projection layers led to very good learning of the target tasks with no drop in performance in held out tasks, even after training all five target tasks in a sequence.”</p><p>The researchers said they believe that “what looks like forgetting or interference after fine-tuning on a narrow target task is actually bias in the output distribution due to the task distribution shift.”</p><h2>Narrow retraining</h2><p>That finding turned out to be the key to the experiment. The researchers noted that tuning the MLP increases the likelihood of “outputting numeric tokens and a highly correlated drop in held out task accuracy.” What it showed is that a model forgetting some of its knowledge is only temporary and not a long-term matter. </p><p>“To avoid biasing the output distribution, we tune the MLP up/gating projections while keeping the down projection frozen, and find that it achieves similar learning to full MLP tuning with little forgetting,” the researchers said. </p><p>This allows for a more straightforward and more reproducible method for fine-tuning a model. </p><p>By focusing on a narrow segment of the model, rather than a wholesale retraining, enterprises can cut compute costs. It also allows better control of output drift. </p><p>However, the research focuses only on two models, specifically those dealing with vision and language. The researchers noted that due to limited resources, they are unable to try the experiment with other models.</p><p>Their findings, however, can be extended to other LLMs, especially for different modalities. </p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/wvhlzgUGzNikEzmtJxvNB/ed69fb909b090e1e7e6b81ff61abf8b0/crimedy7_illustration_of_a_sculptor_creating_a_robot_from_a_p_501bf165-0b44-4bb1-9608-1025a42400b7_1.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[This new AI technique creates ‘digital twin’ consumers, and it could kill the traditional survey industry]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/this-new-ai-technique-creates-digital-twin-consumers-and-it-could-kill-the</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5Y4HqdRooJefh1Y6lVUcfK</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>A new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338\"><u>research paper</u></a> quietly published last week outlines a breakthrough method that allows large language models (LLMs) to simulate human consumer behavior with startling accuracy, a development that could reshape the multi-billion-dollar <a href=\"https://www.rivaltech.com/blog/market-research-trends\"><u>market research industry</u></a>. The technique promises to create armies of synthetic consumers who can provide not just realistic product ratings, but also the qualitative reasoning behind them, at a scale and speed currently unattainable.</p><p>For years, companies have sought to use AI for market research, but have been stymied by a fundamental flaw: when asked to provide a numerical rating on a scale of 1 to 5, LLMs produce unrealistic and poorly distributed responses. A new paper, &quot;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338\"><u>LLMs Reproduce Human Purchase Intent via Semantic Similarity Elicitation of Likert Ratings</u></a>,&quot; submitted to the pre-print server arXiv on October 9th proposes an elegant solution that sidesteps this problem entirely.</p><p>The international team of researchers, led by Benjamin F. Maier, developed a method they call <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338\"><u>semantic similarity rating (SSR)</u></a>. Instead of asking an LLM for a number, SSR prompts the model for a rich, textual opinion on a product. This text is then converted into a numerical vector — an &quot;embedding&quot; — and its similarity is measured against a set of pre-defined reference statements. For example, a response of &quot;I would absolutely buy this, it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m looking for&quot; would be semantically closer to the reference statement for a &quot;5&quot; rating than to the statement for a &quot;1.&quot;</p><p>The results are striking. Tested against a massive real-world dataset from a leading personal care corporation — comprising 57 product surveys and 9,300 human responses — the SSR method achieved 90% of human test-retest reliability. Crucially, the distribution of AI-generated ratings was statistically almost indistinguishable from the human panel. The authors state, &quot;This framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving traditional survey metrics and interpretability.&quot;</p><h2>A timely solution as AI threatens survey integrity</h2><p>This development arrives at a critical time, as the integrity of traditional online survey panels is increasingly under threat from AI. A 2024 analysis from the <a href=\"https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/ai-generated-survey-responses-could-make-research-less-accurate-lot-less-interesting\"><u>Stanford Graduate School of Business</u></a> highlighted a growing problem of human survey-takers using chatbots to generate their answers. These AI-generated responses were found to be &quot;suspiciously nice,&quot; overly verbose, and lacking the &quot;snark&quot; and authenticity of genuine human feedback, leading to what researchers called a &quot;homogenization&quot; of data that could mask serious issues like discrimination or product flaws.</p><p>Maier&#x27;s research offers a starkly different approach: instead of fighting to purge contaminated data, it creates a controlled environment for generating high-fidelity synthetic data from the ground up.</p><p>&quot;What we&#x27;re seeing is a pivot from defense to offense,&quot; said one analyst not affiliated with the study. &quot;The Stanford paper showed the chaos of uncontrolled AI polluting human datasets. This new paper shows the order and utility of controlled AI creating its own datasets. For a Chief Data Officer, this is the difference between cleaning a contaminated well and tapping into a fresh spring.&quot;</p><h2>From text to intent: The technical leap behind the synthetic consumer</h2><p>The technical validity of the new method hinges on the quality of the text embeddings, a concept explored in a 2022 paper in <a href=\"https://epjdatascience.springeropen.com/articles/10.1140/epjds/s13688-022-00353-7\"><u>EPJ Data Science</u></a>. That research argued for a rigorous &quot;construct validity&quot; framework to ensure that text embeddings — the numerical representations of text — truly &quot;measure what they are supposed to.&quot; </p><p>The success of the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08338\"><u>SSR method</u></a> suggests its embeddings effectively capture the nuances of purchase intent. For this new technique to be widely adopted, enterprises will need to be confident that the underlying models are not just generating plausible text, but are mapping that text to scores in a way that is robust and meaningful.</p><p>The approach also represents a significant leap from prior research, which has largely focused on using text embeddings to analyze and predict ratings from existing online reviews. A <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363517789_Performance_Evaluation_of_Text_Embeddings_with_Online_Consumer_Reviews_in_Retail_Sectors\"><u>2022 study</u></a>, for example, evaluated the performance of models like BERT and word2vec in predicting review scores on retail sites, finding that newer models like BERT performed better for general use. The new research moves beyond analyzing existing data to generating novel, predictive insights before a product even hits the market.</p><h2>The dawn of the digital focus group</h2><p>For technical decision-makers, the implications are profound. The ability to spin up a &quot;digital twin&quot; of a target consumer segment and test product concepts, ad copy, or packaging variations in a matter of hours could drastically accelerate innovation cycles. </p><p>As the paper notes, these synthetic respondents also provide &quot;rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings,&quot; offering a treasure trove of data for product development that is both scalable and interpretable. While the era of human-only focus groups is far from over, this research provides the most compelling evidence yet that their synthetic counterparts are ready for business.</p><p>But the business case extends beyond speed and scale. Consider the economics: a traditional survey panel for a national product launch might cost tens of thousands of dollars and take weeks to field. An SSR-based simulation could deliver comparable insights in a fraction of the time, at a fraction of the cost, and with the ability to iterate instantly based on findings. For companies in fast-moving consumer goods categories — where the window between concept and shelf can determine market leadership — this velocity advantage could be decisive.</p><p>There are, of course, caveats. The method was validated on personal care products; its performance on complex B2B purchasing decisions, luxury goods, or culturally specific products remains unproven. And while the paper demonstrates that SSR can replicate aggregate human behavior, it does not claim to predict individual consumer choices. The technique works at the population level, not the person level — a distinction that matters greatly for applications like personalized marketing.</p><p>Yet even with these limitations, the research is a watershed. While the era of human-only focus groups is far from over, this paper provides the most compelling evidence yet that their synthetic counterparts are ready for business. The question is no longer whether AI can simulate consumer sentiment, but whether enterprises can move fast enough to capitalize on it before their competitors do.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>ecommerce</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/51ORdJ4l6mg6ZSTkJpGFOw/85fa4483c879359d1872778236f4fc20/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_AI_shopper_silhouette_e82a806b-f70d-4b1d-9418-71b2ffd65ea4.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Salesforce bets on AI 'agents' to fix what it calls a $7 billion problem in enterprise software]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/salesforce-bets-on-ai-agents-to-fix-what-it-calls-a-usd7-billion-problem-in</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4GsVClkE9RDiQBtDTMH5zv</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>As 50,000 attendees descend on Salesforce&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/\"><u>Dreamforce conference</u></a> this week, the enterprise software giant is making its most aggressive bet yet on artificial intelligence agents, positioning itself as the antidote to what it calls an industry-wide &quot;pilot purgatory&quot; where <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\"><u>95% of enterprise AI projects never reach production</u></a>.</p><p>The company on Monday launched <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/\"><u>Agentforce 360</u></a>, a sweeping reimagination of its entire product portfolio designed to transform businesses into what it calls &quot;agentic enterprises&quot; — organizations where AI agents work alongside humans to handle up to 40% of work across sales, service, marketing, and operations.</p><p>&quot;We are truly in the agentic AI era, and I think it&#x27;s probably the biggest revolution, the biggest transition in technology I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my career,&quot; said Parker Harris, Salesforce&#x27;s co-founder and chief technology officer, during a recent press briefing. &quot;In the future, 40% of the work in the Fortune 1000 is probably going to be done by AI, and it&#x27;s going to be humans and AI actually working together.&quot;</p><p>The announcement comes at a pivotal moment for Salesforce, which has deployed more than 12,000 AI agent implementations over the past year while building what Harris called a &quot;$7 billion business&quot; around its AI platform. Yet the launch also arrives amid unusual turbulence, as CEO Marc Benioff faces <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/11/slap-in-the-face-marc-benioffs-trump-turn-stuns-san-francisco-00604421\"><u>fierce backlash</u></a> for recent comments <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/us/marc-benioff-san-francisco-guard.html\"><u>supporting President Trump</u></a> and suggesting National Guard troops should patrol San Francisco streets.</p><h2>Why 95% of enterprise AI projects never launch</h2><p>The stakes are enormous. While companies have rushed to experiment with AI following ChatGPT&#x27;s emergence two years ago, most enterprise deployments have stalled before reaching production, according to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/\"><u>recent MIT research</u></a> that Salesforce executives cited extensively.</p><p>&quot;Customers have invested a lot in AI, but they&#x27;re not getting the value,&quot; said Srini Tallapragada, Salesforce&#x27;s president and chief engineering and customer success officer. &quot;95% of enterprise AI pilots fail before production. It&#x27;s not because of lack of intent. People want to do this. Everybody understands the power of the technology. But why is it so hard?&quot;</p><p>The answer, according to Tallapragada, is that AI tools remain disconnected from enterprise workflows, data, and governance systems. &quot;You&#x27;re writing prompts, prompts, you&#x27;re getting frustrated because the context is not there,&quot; he said, describing what he called a &quot;prompt doom loop.&quot;</p><p>Salesforce&#x27;s solution is a deeply integrated platform connecting what it calls four ingredients: the Agentforce 360 agent platform, Data 360 for unified data access, Customer 360 apps containing business logic, and Slack as the &quot;conversational interface&quot; where humans and agents collaborate.</p><h2>Slack becomes the front door to Salesforce</h2><p>Perhaps the most significant strategic shift is the elevation of <a href=\"https://slack.com/\"><u>Slack</u></a> — acquired by Salesforce in 2019 for <a href=\"https://slack.com/blog/news/salesforce-completes-acquisition-of-slack\"><u>$27.7 billion</u></a> — as the primary interface for Salesforce itself. The company is effectively reimagining its traditional Lightning interface around Slack channels, where sales deals, service cases, and data insights will surface conversationally rather than through forms and dashboards.</p><p>&quot;Imagine that you maybe don&#x27;t log into Salesforce, you don&#x27;t see Salesforce, but it&#x27;s there. It&#x27;s coming to you in Slack, because that&#x27;s where you&#x27;re getting your work done,&quot; Harris explained.</p><p>The strategy includes embedding Salesforce&#x27;s Agentforce agents for sales, IT service, HR service, and analytics directly into Slack, alongside a completely rebuilt Slackbot that acts as a personal AI companion. The company is also launching &quot;<a href=\"https://slack.com/blog/news/channel-expert\"><u>Channel Expert</u></a>,&quot; an always-on agent that provides instant answers from channel conversations.</p><p>To enable third-party AI tools to access Slack&#x27;s conversational data, Salesforce is releasing a <a href=\"https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/\"><u>Real-Time Search API</u></a> and <a href=\"https://slack.dev/secure-data-connectivity-for-the-modern-ai-era/\"><u>Model Context Protocol server</u></a>. Partners including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, Writer, Dropbox, Notion, and Cursor are building agents that will live natively in Slack.</p><p>&quot;The best way to see the power of the platform is through the AI apps and agents already being built,&quot; Rob Seaman, a Salesforce executive, said during a technical briefing, citing examples of startups &quot;achieving tens of thousands of customers that have it installed in 120 days or less.&quot;</p><h2>Voice and IT service take aim at new markets</h2><p>Beyond Slack integration, Salesforce announced major expansions into voice-based interactions and employee service. <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/agentforce-voice-solutions-launch/\"><u>Agentforce Voice</u></a>, now generally available, transforms traditional IVR systems into natural conversations that can update CRM records, trigger workflows, and seamlessly hand off to human agents.</p><p>The IT Service offering represents Salesforce&#x27;s most direct challenge to <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a>, the market leader. Mudhu Sudhakar, who joined Salesforce two months ago as senior vice president for IT and HR Service, positioned the product as a fundamental reimagining of employee support.</p><p>&quot;Legacy IT service management is very portals, forms, tickets focused, manual process,&quot; Sudhakar said. &quot;What we had a few key tenets: conversation first and agent first, really focused on having a conversational experience for the people requesting the support and for the people providing the support.&quot;</p><p>The IT Service platform includes what Salesforce describes as 25+ specialized agents and 100+ pre-built workflows and connectors that can handle everything from password resets to complex incident management.</p><h2>Early customers report dramatic efficiency gains</h2><p>Customer results suggest the approach is gaining traction. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/\"><u>Reddit</u></a> reduced average support resolution time from 8.9 minutes to 1.4 minutes — an 84% improvement — while deflecting 46% of cases entirely to AI agents. &quot;This efficiency has allowed us to provide on-demand help for complex tasks and boost advertiser satisfaction scores by 20%,&quot; said John Thompson, Reddit&#x27;s VP of sales strategy and operations, in a statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://engine.com/\"><u>Engine</u></a>, a travel management company, reduced average handle time by 15%, saving over $2 million annually. <a href=\"https://www.opentable.com/\"><u>OpenTable</u></a> resolved 70% of restaurant and diner inquiries autonomously. And 1-800Accountant achieved a 90% case deflection rate during the critical tax week period.</p><p>Salesforce&#x27;s own internal deployments may be most telling. Tallapragada&#x27;s customer success organization now handles 1.8 million AI-powered conversations weekly, with metrics published at <a href=\"http://help.salesforce.com\"><u>help.salesforce.com</u></a> showing how many agents answer versus escalating to humans.</p><p>Even more significantly, Salesforce has deployed AI-powered sales development representatives to follow up on leads that would previously have gone uncontacted due to cost constraints. &quot;Now, Agentforce has an SDR which is doing thousands of leads following up,&quot; Tallapragada explained. The company also increased proactive customer outreach by 40% by shifting staff from reactive support.</p><h2>The trust layer problem enterprises can&#x27;t ignore</h2><p>Given enterprise concerns about AI reliability, Salesforce has invested heavily in what it calls the &quot;trust layer&quot; — audit trails, compliance checks, and observability tools that let organizations monitor agent behavior at scale.</p><p>&quot;You should think of an agent as a human. Digital labor. You need to manage performance just like a human. And you need these audit trails,&quot; Tallapragada explained.</p><p>The company encountered this challenge firsthand when its own agent deployment scaled. &quot;When we started at Agentforce at Salesforce, we would track every message, which is great until 1,000, 3,000,&quot; Tallapragada said. &quot;Once you have a million chats, there&#x27;s no human, we cannot do it.&quot;</p><p>The platform now includes &quot;<a href=\"https://www.cxtoday.com/crm/salesforce-teases-a-new-agentforce-builder-announces-more-additions-to-the-platform/\"><u>Agentforce Grid</u></a>&quot; for searching across millions of conversations to identify and fix problematic patterns. The company also introduced Agent Script, a new scripting language that allows developers to define precise guardrails and deterministic controls for agent behavior.</p><h2>Data infrastructure gets a major upgrade</h2><p>Underlying the agent capabilities is significant infrastructure investment. Salesforce&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/blog/what-exactly-is-salesforce-customer-360/\"><u>Data 360</u></a> includes &quot;Intelligent Context,&quot; which automatically extracts structured information from unstructured content like PDFs, diagrams, and flowcharts using what the company describes as &quot;AI-powered unstructured data pipelines.&quot;</p><p>The company is also collaborating with <a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/\"><u>Databricks</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.getdbt.com/\"><u>dbt Labs</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.snowflake.com/en/\"><u>Snowflake</u></a> on the &quot;Universal Semantic Interchange,&quot; an attempt to standardize how different platforms define business metrics. The pending $8 billion acquisition of Informatica, expected to close soon, will expand metadata management capabilities across the enterprise.</p><h2>The competitive landscape keeps intensifying</h2><p>Salesforce&#x27;s aggressive AI agent push comes as virtually every major enterprise software vendor pursues similar strategies. Microsoft has embedded Copilot across its product line, Google offers agent capabilities through Vertex AI and Gemini, and ServiceNow has launched its own agentic offerings.</p><p>When asked how Salesforce&#x27;s announcement compared to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming\"><u>OpenAI&#x27;s recent releases</u></a>, Tallapragada emphasized that customers will use multiple AI tools simultaneously. &quot;Most of the time I&#x27;m seeing they&#x27;re using OpenAI, they&#x27;re using Gemini, they&#x27;re using Anthropic, just like Salesforce, we use all three,&quot; he said.</p><p>The real differentiation, executives argued, lies not in the AI models but in the integration with business processes and data. Harris framed the competition in terms familiar from Salesforce&#x27;s founding: &quot;26 years ago, we just said, let&#x27;s make Salesforce automation as easy as buying a book on Amazon.com. We&#x27;re doing that same thing. We want to make agentic AI as easy as buying a book on Amazon.&quot;</p><p>The company&#x27;s customer success stories are impressive but remain a small fraction of its customer base. With 150,000 Salesforce customers and one million Slack customers, the 12,000 Agentforce deployments represent roughly 8% penetration — strong for a one-year-old product line, but hardly ubiquitous.</p><p>The company&#x27;s stock, down <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-trades-near-52-132500685.html\"><u>roughly 28% year to date</u></a> with a <a href=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/salesforce-stock-crm-ai-dreamforce/\"><u>Relative Strength rating of just 15</u></a>, suggests investors remain skeptical. This week&#x27;s Dreamforce demonstrations — and the months of customer deployments that follow — will begin to provide answers to whether Salesforce can finally move enterprise AI from pilots to production at scale, or whether the &quot;$7 billion business&quot; remains more aspiration than reality.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Automation</category>\n            <category>Data Infrastructure</category>\n            <category>Enterprise</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4ElJnVoqNF5EdTdQ2qbc94/6c61cde31557a66a34fdfbbfaa9e57ed/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_businessperson_guiding_robot_f1c9b0fc-59ad-455c-b635-5551c598aa7b.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Breaking the bottleneck: Why AI demands an SSD-first future]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/breaking-the-bottleneck-why-ai-demands-an-ssd-first-future</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4OyjKtAnCF5EJcJscK6vUm</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Presented by Solidigm</i></p><hr/><p>As AI adoption surges, data centers face a critical bottleneck in storage — and traditional HDDs are at the center of it. Data that once sat idle as cold archives is now being pulled into frequent use to build more accurate models and deliver better inference results. This shift from cold data to warm data demands low-latency, high-throughput storage that can handle parallel computations. HDDs will remain the workhorse for low-cost cold storage, but without rethinking their role, the high-capacity storage layer risks becoming the weakest link in the AI factory.</p><p>&quot;Modern AI workloads, combined with data center constraints, have created new challenges for HDDs,&quot; says Jeff Janukowicz, research vice president at IDC. &quot;While HDD suppliers are addressing data storage growth by offering larger drives, this often comes at the expense of slower performance. As a result, the concept of &#x27;nearline SSDs&#x27; is becoming an increasingly relevant topic of discussion within the industry.&quot; </p><p>Today, AI operators need to maximize GPU utilization, manage network-attached storage efficiently, and scale compute — all while cutting costs on increasingly scarce power and space. In an environment where every watt and every square inch counts, says Roger Corell, senior director of AI and leadership marketing at Solidigm, success requires more than a technical refresh. It calls for a deeper realignment.</p><p>“It speaks to the tectonic shift in the value of data for AI,” Corell says. “That’s where high-capacity SSDs come into play. Along with capacity, they bring performance and efficiency -- enabling exabyte-scale storage pipelines to keep pace with the relentless pace of data set size. All of that consumes power and space, so we need to do it as efficiently as possible to enable more GPU scale in this constrained environment.”</p><p>High-capacity SSDs aren’t just displacing HDDs — they’re removing one of the biggest bottlenecks on the AI factory floor. By delivering massive gains in performance, efficiency, and density, SSDs free up the power and space needed to push GPU scale further. It’s less a storage upgrade than a structural shift in how data infrastructure is designed for the AI era.</p><h3><b>HDDs vs. SDDs: More than just a hardware refresh</b></h3><p>HDDs have impressive mechanical designs, but they&#x27;re made up of many moving parts that at scale use more energy, take up more space, and fail at a higher rate than solid state drives. The reliance on spinning platters and mechanical read/write heads inherently limits Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS), creating bottlenecks for AI workloads that demand low latency, high concurrency, and sustained throughput. </p><p>HDDs also struggle with latency-sensitive tasks, as the physical act of seeking data introduces mechanical delays unsuited for real-time AI inference and training. Moreover, their power and cooling requirements increase significantly under frequent and intensive data access, reducing efficiency as data scales and warms.</p><p>In contrast, the SSD-based VAST storage solution reduces energy usage by ~$1M a year, and in an AI environment where every watt matters, this is a huge advantage for SSDs. To demonstrate, Solidigm and VAST Data completed a study examining the economics of data storage at exabyte scale — a quadrillion bytes, or a billion gigabytes, with an analysis of storage power consumption versus HDDs over a 10-year period. </p><p>As a starting reference point, you’d need four 30TB HDDs to equal the capacity of a single 122TB Solidigm SSD. After factoring in VAST’s data reduction techniques made possible by the superior performance of SSDs, the exabyte solution comprises 3,738 Solidigm SSDs vs over 40,000 high-capacity HDDs. The study found that the SSD-based VAST solution consumes 77% less storage energy. </p><h3><b>Minimizing data center footprints</b></h3><p>&quot;We’re shipping 122-terabyte drives to some of the top OEMs and leading AI cloud service providers in the world,&quot; Corell says. &quot;When you compare an all-122TB SSD to hybrid HDD + TLC SSD configuration, they&#x27;re getting a nine-to-one savings in data center footprint. And yes, it’s important in these massive data centers that are building their own nuclear reactors and signing hefty power purchase agreements with renewable energy providers, but it’s increasingly important as you get to the regional data centers, the local data centers, and all the way out to your edge deployments where space can come at a premium.&quot;</p><p>That nine-to-one savings goes beyond space and power — it lets organizations fit infrastructure into previously unavailable spaces, expand GPU scale, or build smaller footprints.</p><p>&quot;If you’re given X amount of land and Y amount of power, you’re going to use it. You’re AI&quot; Corell explains, “where every watt and square inch counts, so why not use it in the most efficient way? Get the most efficient storage possible on the planet and enable greater GPU scale within that envelope that you have to fit in. On an ongoing basis, it’s going to save you operational cost as well. You have 90 percent fewer storage bays to maintain, and the cost associated with that is gone.&quot;</p><p>Another often-overlooked element, the (much) larger physical footprint of data stored on mechanical HDDs results in a greater construction materials footprint. Collectively, concrete and steel production accounts for over 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. By reducing the physical footprint of storage, high-capacity SSDs can help reduce embodied concrete and steel-based emissions by more than 80% compared to HDDs. And in the last phase of the sustainability life cycle, which is drive end-of-life, there will be 90% percent fewer drives to disposition. . </p><h3><b>Reshaping cold and archival storage strategies</b></h3><p>The move to SDD isn&#x27;t just a storage upgrade; it&#x27;s a fundamental realignment of data infrastructure strategy in the AI era, and it&#x27;s picking up speed.</p><p>&quot;Big hyperscalers are looking to wring the most out of their existing infrastructure, doing unnatural acts, if you will, with HDDs like overprovisioning them to near 90% to try to wring out as many IOPS per terabyte as possible, but they’re beginning to come around,&quot; Corell says. &quot;Once they turn to a modern all high-capacity storage infrastructure, the industry at large will be on that trajectory. Plus, we&#x27;re starting to see these lessons learned on the value of modern storage in AI applied to other segments as well, such as big data analytics, HPC, and many more.&quot;</p><p>While all-flash solutions are being embraced almost universally, there will always be a place for HDDs, he adds. HDDs will persist in usages like archival, cold storage, and scenarios where pure cost per gigabyte concerns outweigh the need for real-time access. But as the token economy heats up and enterprises realize value in monetizing data, the warm and warming data segments will continue to grow. </p><h3><b>Solving power challenges of the future</b></h3><p>Now in its 4th generation, with more than 122 cumulative exabytes shipped to date, Solidigm’s QLC (Quad-Level Cell) technology has led the industry in balancing higher drive capacities with cost efficiency.</p><p>&quot;We don’t think of storage as just storing bits and bytes. We think about how we can develop these amazing drives that are able to deliver benefits at a solution level,&quot; Corell says. &quot;The shining star on that is our recently launched, E1.S, designed specifically for dense and efficient storage in direct attach storage configurations for the next-generation fanless GPU server.&quot;</p><p>The Solidigm D7-PS1010 E1.S is a breakthrough, the industry’s first eSSD with single-sided direct-to-chip liquid cooling technology. Solidigm worked with NVIDIA to address the dual challenges of heat management and cost efficiency, while delivering the high performance required for demanding AI workloads. </p><p>&quot;We’re rapidly moving to an environment where all critical IT components will be direct-to-chip liquid-cooled on the direct attach side,&quot; he says. &quot;I think the market needs to be looking at their approach to cooling, because power limitations, power challenges are not going to abate in my lifetime, at least. They need to be applying a neocloud mindset to how they’re architecting the most efficient infrastructure.&quot;</p><p>Increasingly complex inference is pushing against a memory wall, which makes storage architecture a front-line design challenge, not an afterthought. High-capacity SSDs, paired with liquid cooling and efficient design, are emerging as the only path to meet AI’s escalating demands. The mandate now is to build infrastructure not just for efficiency, but for storage that can efficiently scale as data grows. The organizations that realign storage now will be the ones able to scale AI tomorrow.</p><hr/><p><i>Sponsored articles are content produced by a company that is either paying for the post or has a business relationship with VentureBeat, and they’re always clearly marked.

Next, you ask an AI tool to figure out why your top competitor grew so fast last quarter. The <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-vibe-coding-ruining-a-generation-of-engineers\">AI silently gets to work</a>. It scours financial reports, news articles and social media sentiment. It cross-references that data with your internal sales numbers, drafts a strategy outlining three potential reasons for the competitor&#x27;s success and schedules a 30-minute meeting with your team to present its findings.</p><p>We&#x27;re calling both of these &quot;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/neither-driver-nor-passenger-covenantal-co-creator\">AI agents</a>,&quot; but they represent worlds of difference in intelligence, capability and the level of trust we place in them. This ambiguity creates a fog that makes it difficult to build, evaluate, and safely govern these powerful new tools. If we can&#x27;t agree on what we&#x27;re building, how can we know when we&#x27;ve succeeded?</p><p>This post won&#x27;t try to sell you on yet another definitive framework. Instead, think of it as a survey of the current landscape of agent autonomy, a map to help us all navigate the terrain together.</p><h2>What are we even talking about? Defining an &quot;AI agent&quot;</h2><p>Before we can measure an agent&#x27;s autonomy, we need to agree on what an &quot;agent&quot; actually is. The most widely accepted starting point comes from the foundational textbook on AI, Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig’s<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent\"> “<u>Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</u></a>.” </p><p>They define an agent as anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. A thermostat is a simple agent: Its sensor perceives the room temperature, and its actuator acts by turning the heat on or off.</p><p><i>ReAct Model for AI Agents (Credit: Confluent)</i> </p><p>That classic definition provides a solid mental model. For today&#x27;s technology, we can translate it into four key components that make up a modern AI agent:</p><ol><li><p><b>Perception </b>(the &quot;senses&quot;): This is how an agent takes in information about its digital or physical environment. It&#x27;s the input stream that allows the agent to understand the current state of the world relevant to its task.</p></li><li><p><b>Reasoning engine</b> (the &quot;brain&quot;): This is the core logic that processes the perceptions and decides what to do next. For modern agents, this is typically powered by a large language model (LLM). The engine is responsible for planning, breaking down large goals into smaller steps, handling errors and choosing the right tools for the job.</p></li><li><p><b>Action </b>(the &quot;hands&quot;): This is how an agent affects its environment to move closer to its goal. The ability to take action via tools is what gives an agent its power.</p></li><li><p><b>Goal/objective</b>: This is the overarching task or purpose that guides all of the agent&#x27;s actions. It is the &quot;why&quot; that turns a collection of tools into a purposeful system. The goal can be simple (&quot;Find the best price for this book&quot;) or complex (&quot;Launch the marketing campaign for our new product&quot;)</p></li></ol><p>Putting it all together, a true agent is a full-body system. The reasoning engine is the brain, but it’s useless without the senses (perception) to understand the world and the hands (actions) to change it. This complete system, all guided by a central goal, is what creates genuine agency.</p><p>With these components in mind, the distinction we made earlier becomes clear. A standard chatbot isn&#x27;t a true agent. It perceives your question and acts by providing an answer, but it lacks an overarching goal and the ability to use external tools to accomplish it.</p><p>An agent, on the other hand, is software that has agency. </p><p>It has the capacity to act independently and dynamically toward a goal. And it&#x27;s this capacity that makes a discussion about the levels of autonomy so important.</p><h2>Learning from the past: How we learned to classify autonomy</h2><p>The dizzying pace of AI can make it feel like we&#x27;re navigating uncharted territory. But when it comes to classifying autonomy, we’re not starting from scratch. Other industries have been working on this problem for decades, and their playbooks offer powerful lessons for the world of <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/teaching-the-model-designing-llm-feedback-loops-that-get-smarter-over-time\">AI agents</a>.</p><p>The core challenge is always the same: How do you create a clear, shared language for the gradual handover of responsibility from a human to a machine?</p><h3>SAE levels of driving automation</h3><p>Perhaps the most successful framework comes from the automotive industry. The<a href=\"https://www.sae.org/blog/sae-j3016-update\"> <u>SAE J3016 standard</u></a> defines six levels of driving automation, from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous).</p><p><i>The SAE J3016 Levels of Driving Automation (Credit: SAE International)</i> </p><p>What makes this model so effective isn&#x27;t its technical detail, but its focus on two simple concepts:</p><ol><li><p><b>Dynamic driving task (DDT):</b> This is everything involved in the real-time act of driving: steering, braking, accelerating and monitoring the road.</p></li><li><p><b>Operational design domain (ODD):</b> These are the specific conditions under which the system is designed to work. For example, &quot;only on divided highways&quot; or &quot;only in clear weather during the daytime.&quot;</p></li></ol><p>The question for each level is simple: Who is doing the DDT, and what is the ODD? </p><p>At Level 2, the human must supervise at all times. At Level 3, the car handles the DDT within its ODD, but the human must be ready to take over. At Level 4, the car can handle everything within its ODD, and if it encounters a problem, it can safely pull over on its own.</p><p><b>The key insight for AI agents:</b> A robust framework isn&#x27;t about the sophistication of the AI &quot;brain.&quot; It&#x27;s about clearly defining the division of responsibility between human and machine under specific, well-defined conditions.</p><h3>Aviation&#x27;s 10 Levels of Automation</h3><p>While the SAE’s six levels are great for broad classification, aviation offers a more granular model for systems designed for close human-machine collaboration. The<a href=\"https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/pr-16-3426-lessons-lost-automation-in-aviation-definition-of-automation.pdf\"> <u>Parasuraman, Sheridan, and Wickens model</u></a> proposes a detailed 10-level spectrum of automation.</p><p><i>Levels of Automation of Decision and Action Selection for Aviation (Credit: The MITRE Corporation)</i></p><p>This framework is less about full autonomy and more about the nuances of interaction. For example:</p><ul><li><p>At <b>Level 3</b>, the computer &quot;narrows the selection down to a few&quot; for the human to choose from.</p></li><li><p>At <b>Level 6</b>, the computer &quot;allows the human a restricted time to veto before it executes&quot; an action.</p></li><li><p>At <b>Level 9</b>, the computer &quot;informs the human only if it, the computer, decides to.&quot;</p></li></ul><p><b>The key insight for AI agents:</b> This model is perfect for describing the collaborative &quot;centaur&quot; systems we&#x27;re seeing today. Most AI agents won&#x27;t be fully autonomous (Level 10) but will exist somewhere on this spectrum, acting as a co-pilot that suggests, executes with approval or acts with a veto window.</p><h3>Robotics and unmanned systems</h3><p>Finally, the world of robotics brings in another critical dimension: context. The National Institute of Standards and Technology&#x27;s (NIST)<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/cognition-and-collaboration-systems/autonomy-levels-unmanned\"><u> Autonomy Levels for Unmanned Systems (ALFUS) framework</u></a> was designed for systems like drones and industrial robots.</p><p><i>The Three-Axis Model for ALFUS (Credit: NIST)</i> </p><p>Its main contribution is adding context to the definition of autonomy, assessing it along three axes:</p><ol><li><p><b>Human independence:</b> How much human supervision is required?</p></li><li><p><b>Mission complexity:</b> How difficult or unstructured is the task?</p></li><li><p><b>Environmental complexity:</b> How predictable and stable is the environment in which the agent operates?</p></li></ol><p><b>The key insight for AI agents:</b> This framework reminds us that autonomy isn&#x27;t a single number. An agent performing a simple task in a stable, predictable digital environment (like sorting files in a single folder) is fundamentally less autonomous than an agent performing a complex task across the chaotic, unpredictable environment of the open internet, even if the level of human supervision is the same.</p><h2>The emerging frameworks for AI agents</h2><p>Having looked at the lessons from automotive, aviation and robotics, we can now examine the emerging frameworks designed for <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that\">AI agents</a>. While the field is still new and no single standard has won out, most proposals fall into three distinct, but often overlapping, categories based on the primary question they seek to answer.</p><h3>Category 1: The &quot;What can it do?&quot; frameworks (capability-focused)</h3><p>These frameworks classify agents based on their underlying technical architecture and what they are capable of achieving. They provide a roadmap for developers, outlining a progression of increasingly sophisticated technical milestones that often correspond directly to code patterns.</p><p>A prime example of this developer-centric approach comes from Hugging Face. Their<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02649\"> <u>framework</u></a> uses a star rating to show the gradual shift in control from human to AI:</p><p><i>Five Levels of AI Agent Autonomy, as proposed by HuggingFace (Credit: Hugging Face)</i>\n</p><ul><li><p><b>Zero stars (simple processor):</b> The AI has no impact on the program&#x27;s flow. It simply processes information and its output is displayed, like a print statement. The human is in complete control.</p></li><li><p><b>One star (router):</b> The AI makes a basic decision that directs program flow, like choosing between two predefined paths (if/else). The human still defines <i>how</i> everything is done.</p></li><li><p><b>Two stars (tool call):</b> The AI chooses which predefined tool to use and what arguments to use with it. The human has defined the available tools, but the AI decides how to execute them.</p></li><li><p><b>Three stars (multi-step agent):</b> The AI now controls the iteration loop. It decides which tool to use, when to use it and whether to continue working on the task.</p></li><li><p><b>Four stars (fully autonomous):</b> The AI can generate and execute entirely new code to accomplish a goal, going beyond the predefined tools it was given.</p></li></ul><p><b>Strengths:</b> This model is excellent for engineers. It&#x27;s concrete, maps directly to code and clearly benchmarks the transfer of executive control to the AI. </p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> It is highly technical and less intuitive for non-developers trying to understand an agent&#x27;s real-world impact.</p><h3>Category 2: The &quot;How do we work together?&quot; frameworks (interaction-focused)</h3><p>This second category defines autonomy not by the agent’s internal skills, but by the nature of its relationship with the human user. The central question is: Who is in control, and how do we collaborate?</p><p>This approach often mirrors the nuance we saw in the aviation models. For instance, a framework detailed in the paper<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12469\"> <u>Levels of Autonomy for AI Agents</u></a> defines levels based on the user&#x27;s role:</p><ul><li><p><b>L1 - user as an operator:</b> The human is in direct control (like a person using Photoshop with AI-assist features).</p></li><li><p><b>L4 - user as an approver:</b> The agent proposes a full plan or action, and the human must give a simple &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; before it proceeds.</p></li><li><p><b>L5 - user as an observer:</b> The agent has full autonomy to pursue a goal and simply reports its progress and results back to the human.</p></li></ul><p><i>Levels of Autonomy for AI Agents</i></p><p><b>Strengths:</b> These frameworks are highly intuitive and user-centric. They directly address the critical issues of control, trust, and oversight.</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> An agent with simple capabilities and one with highly advanced reasoning could both fall into the &quot;Approver&quot; level, so this approach can sometimes obscure the underlying technical sophistication.</p><h3>Category 3: The &quot;Who is responsible?&quot; frameworks (governance-focused)</h3><p>The final category is less concerned with how an agent works and more with what happens when it fails. These frameworks are designed to help answer crucial questions about law, safety and ethics.</p><p>Think tanks like Germany&#x27;s Stiftung Neue VTrantwortung have<a href=\"https://zavod14.si/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/ELF_PP_How-to-regulate-AI_2019.pdf\"> <u>analyzed</u></a> AI agents through the lens of legal liability. Their work aims to classify agents in a way that helps regulators determine who is responsible for an agent&#x27;s actions: The user who deployed it, the developer who built it or the company that owns the platform it runs on?</p><p>This perspective is essential for navigating complex regulations like the<a href=\"https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/\"> <u>EU&#x27;s Artificial Intelligence Act</u></a>, which will treat AI systems differently based on the level of risk they pose.</p><p><b>Strengths:</b> This approach is absolutely essential for real-world deployment. It forces the difficult but necessary conversations about accountability that build public trust.</p><p><b>Weaknesses:</b> It&#x27;s more of a legal or policy guide than a technical roadmap for developers.</p><p>A comprehensive understanding requires looking at all three questions at once: An agent&#x27;s capabilities, how we interact with it and who is responsible for the outcome..</p><h2>Identifying the gaps and challenges</h2><p>Looking at the landscape of autonomy frameworks shows us that no  single model is sufficient because the true challenges lie in the gaps between them, in areas that are incredibly difficult to define and measure.</p><h3>What is the &quot;Road&quot; for a digital agent?</h3><p>The SAE framework for self-driving cars gave us the powerful concept of an ODD, the specific conditions under which a system can operate safely. For a car, that might be &quot;divided highways, in clear weather, during the day.&quot; This is a great solution for a physical environment, but what’s the ODD for a digital agent?</p><p>The &quot;road&quot; for an agent is the entire internet. An infinite, chaotic and constantly changing environment. Websites get redesigned overnight, APIs are deprecated and social norms in online communities shift. </p><p>How do we define a &quot;safe&quot; operational boundary for an agent that can browse websites, access databases and interact with third-party services? Answering this is one of the biggest unsolved problems. Without a clear digital ODD, we can&#x27;t make the same safety guarantees that are becoming standard in the automotive world.</p><p>This is why, for now, the most effective and reliable agents operate within well-defined, closed-world scenarios. As I argued in a recent<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/forget-the-hype-real-ai-agents-solve-bounded-problems-not-open-world-fantasies/\"> <u>VentureBeat article</u></a>, forgetting the open-world fantasies and focusing on &quot;bounded problems&quot; is the key to real-world success. This means defining a clear, limited set of tools, data sources and potential actions. </p><h3>Beyond simple tool use</h3><p>Today&#x27;s agents are getting very good at executing straightforward plans. If you tell one to &quot;find the price of this item using Tool A, then book a meeting with Tool B,&quot; it can often succeed. But true autonomy requires much more. </p><p>Many systems today hit a technical wall when faced with tasks that require:</p><ul><li><p><b>Long-term reasoning and planning:</b> Agents struggle to create and adapt complex, multi-step plans in the face of uncertainty. They can follow a recipe, but they can&#x27;t yet invent one from scratch when things go wrong.</p></li><li><p><b>Robust self-correction:</b> What happens when an API call fails or a website returns an unexpected error? A truly autonomous agent needs the resilience to diagnose the problem, form a new hypothesis and try a different approach, all without a human stepping in.</p></li><li><p><b>Composability:</b> The future likely involves not one agent, but a team of specialized agents working together. Getting them to collaborate reliably, to pass information back and forth, delegate tasks and resolve conflicts is a monumental software engineering challenge that we are just beginning to tackle.</p></li></ul><h3>The elephant in the room: Alignment and control</h3><p>This is the most critical challenge of all, because it&#x27;s not just technical, it&#x27;s deeply human. Alignment is the problem of ensuring an agent&#x27;s goals and actions are consistent with our intentions and values, even when those values are complex, unstated or nuanced.</p><p>Imagine you give an agent the seemingly harmless goal of &quot;maximizing customer engagement for our new product.&quot; The agent might correctly determine that the most effective strategy is to send a dozen notifications a day to every user. The agent has achieved its literal goal perfectly, but it has violated the unstated, common-sense goal of &quot;don&#x27;t be incredibly annoying.&quot;</p><p>This is a failure of alignment.</p><p>The core difficulty, which organizations like the<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/\"> <u>AI Alignment Forum</u></a> are dedicated to studying, is that it is incredibly hard to specify fuzzy, complex human preferences in the precise, literal language of code. As agents become more powerful, ensuring they are not just capable but also safe, predictable and aligned with our true intent becomes the most important challenge we face.</p><h2>The future is agentic (and collaborative)</h2><p>The path forward for AI agents is not a single leap to a god-like super-intelligence, but a more practical and collaborative journey. The immense challenges of open-world reasoning and perfect alignment mean that the future is a team effort.</p><p>We will see less of the single, all-powerful agent and more of an &quot;agentic mesh&quot; — a network of specialized agents, each operating within a bounded domain, working together to tackle complex problems. </p><p>More importantly, they will work with us. The most valuable and safest applications will keep a human on the loop, casting them as a co-pilot or strategist to augment our intellect with the speed of machine execution. This &quot;centaur&quot; model will be the most effective and responsible path forward.</p><p>The frameworks we&#x27;ve explored aren’t just theoretical. They’re practical tools for building trust, assigning responsibility and setting clear expectations. They help developers define limits and leaders shape vision, laying the groundwork for AI to become a dependable partner in our work and lives.</p><p><i>Sean Falconer is </i><a href=\"https://www.confluent.io/\"><i>Confluent&#x27;s </i></a><i>AI entrepreneur in residence.</i></p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>DataDecisionMakers</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5b0hTPUKh7PB9D7CfWwO22/3b31fdc3f95c670ce5096758d8760ccd/Agent_autonomy.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Here's what's slowing down your AI strategy — and how to fix it]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/heres-whats-slowing-down-your-ai-strategy-and-how-to-fix-it</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">ImFP5Up720SucsiiqdrLB</guid>\n            <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Your best <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-ai-product-teams-are-rethinking-impact-risk-feasibility\">data science team</a> just spent six months building a model that predicts customer churn with 90% accuracy. It’s sitting on a server, unused. Why? Because it’s been stuck in a risk review queue for a very long period of time, waiting for a committee that doesn’t understand stochastic models to sign off. This isn’t a hypothetical — it’s the daily reality in most large companies.\n\nIn AI, the models move at internet speed. Enterprises don’t.\n\nEvery few weeks, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/solve-the-business-problem-first-or-the-data-doesnt-matter\">a new model family drops</a>, open-source toolchains mutate and entire MLOps practices get rewritten. But in most companies, anything touching production AI has to pass through risk reviews, audit trails, change-management boards and model-risk sign-off. The result is a widening velocity gap: The research community accelerates; the enterprise stalls.\n\nThis gap isn’t a headline problem like “AI will take your job.” It’s quieter and more expensive: missed productivity, shadow AI sprawl, duplicated spend and compliance drag that turns promising pilots into perpetual proofs-of-concept.</p><h2>The numbers say the quiet part out loud</h2><p>Two trends collide. First, the pace of innovation: Industry is now the dominant force, producing the vast majority of notable AI models, according to <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report\">Stanford&#x27;s 2024 AI Index Report</a>. The core inputs for this innovation are compounding at a historic rate, with training compute needs doubling rapidly every few years. That pace all but guarantees rapid model churn and tool fragmentation.\n\nSecond, enterprise adoption is accelerating. According to IBM&#x27;s, <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-01-10-Data-Suggests-Growth-in-Enterprise-Adoption-of-AI-is-Due-to-Widespread-Deployment-by-Early-Adopters\">42% of enterprise-scale companies</a> have actively deployed AI, with many more actively exploring it. Yet the same surveys show governance roles are only now being formalized, leaving many companies to retrofit control after deployment.\n\nLayer on new regulation. The EU AI Act’s staged obligations are locked in — unacceptable-risk bans are already active and General Purpose AI (GPAI) transparency duties hit in mid-2025, with high-risk rules following. Brussels has made clear there’s no pause coming. If your governance isn’t ready, your roadmap will be.</p><h2>The real blocker isn&#x27;t modeling, it&#x27;s audit</h2><p>In most enterprises, the slowest step isn’t fine-tuning a model; it’s proving your model follows certain guidelines.\n\nThree frictions dominate:</p><ol><li><p>Audit debt: Policies were written for static software, not stochastic models. You can ship a microservice with unit tests; you can’t “unit test” fairness drift without data access, lineage and ongoing monitoring. When controls don’t map, reviews balloon.</p></li><li><p>. MRM overload: Model risk management (MRM), a discipline perfected in banking, is spreading beyond finance — often translated literally, not functionally. Explainability and data-governance checks make sense; forcing every retrieval-augmented chatbot through credit-risk style documentation does not.</p></li><li><p>Shadow AI sprawl: Teams adopt vertical AI inside SaaS tools <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that\">without central oversight</a>. It feels fast — until the third audit asks who owns the prompts, where embeddings live and how to revoke data. Sprawl is speed’s illusion; integration and governance are the long-term velocity.</p></li></ol><h2>Frameworks exist, but they&#x27;re not operational by default</h2><p>The NIST AI Risk Management Framework is a solid north star: govern, map, measure, manage. It’s voluntary, adaptable and aligned with international standards. But it’s a blueprint, not a building. Companies still need concrete control catalogs, evidence templates and tooling that turn principles into repeatable reviews.\n\nSimilarly, the EU AI Act sets deadlines and duties. It doesn’t install your model registry, wire your dataset lineage or resolve the age-old question of who signs off when accuracy and bias trade off. That’s on you soon.</p><h2>What winning enterprises are doing differently</h2><p>The leaders I see closing the velocity gap aren’t chasing every model; they’re making the path to production routine. Five moves show up again and again:</p><ol><li><p>Ship a control plane, not a memo: Codify governance as code. Create a small library or service that enforces non-negotiables: Dataset lineage required, evaluation suite attached, risk tier chosen, PII scan passed, human-in-the-loop defined (if required). If a project can’t satisfy the checks, it can’t deploy.</p></li><li><p>Pre-approve patterns: Approve reference architectures — “GPAI with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) on approved vector store,” “high-risk tabular model with feature store X and bias audit Y,” “vendor LLM via API with no data retention.” Pre-approval shifts review from bespoke debates to pattern conformance. (Your auditors will thank you.)</p></li><li><p>Stage your governance by risk, not by team: Tie review depth to use-case criticality (safety, finance, regulated outcomes). A marketing copy assistant shouldn’t endure the same gauntlet as a loan adjudicator. Risk-proportionate review is both defensible and fast.</p></li><li><p>Create an “evidence once, reuse everywhere” backbone: Centralize model cards, eval results, data sheets, prompt templates and vendor attestations. Every subsequent audit should start at 60% done because you’ve already proven the common pieces.</p></li><li><p>Make audit a product: Give legal, risk and compliance a real roadmap. Instrument dashboards that show: Models in production by risk tier, upcoming re-evals, incidents and data-retention attestations. If audit can self-serve, engineering can ship.</p></li></ol><h2>A pragmatic cadence for the next 12 months</h2><p>If you’re serious about catching up, pick a 12-month governance sprint:</p><ul><li><p>Quarter 1: Stand up a minimal AI registry (models, datasets, prompts, evaluations). Draft risk-tiering and control mapping aligned to NIST AI RMF functions; publish two pre-approved patterns.</p></li><li><p>Quarter 2: Turn controls into pipelines (CI checks for evals, data scans, model cards). Convert two fast-moving teams from shadow AI to platform AI by making the paved road easier than the side road.</p></li><li><p>Quarter 3: Pilot a GxP-style review (a rigorous documentation standard from life sciences) for one high-risk use case; automate evidence capture. Start your EU AI Act gap analysis if you touch Europe; assign owners and deadlines.</p></li><li><p>Quarter 4: Expand your pattern catalog (RAG, batch inference, streaming prediction). Roll out dashboards for risk/compliance. Bake governance SLAs into your OKRs.\n\nBy this point, you haven’t slowed down innovation — you’ve standardized it. The research community can keep moving at light speed; you can keep shipping at enterprise speed — without the audit queue becoming your critical path.</p></li></ul><h2>The competitive edge isn&#x27;t the next model — it&#x27;s the next mile</h2><p>It’s tempting to chase each week’s leaderboard. But the durable advantage is the mile between a paper and production: The platform, the patterns, the proofs. That’s what your competitors can’t copy from GitHub, and it’s the only way to keep velocity without trading compliance for chaos.\n\nIn other words: Make governance the grease, not the grit.\n\n<i>Jayachander Reddy Kandakatla is senior machine learning operations (MLOps) engineer at Ford Motor Credit Company.</i></p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>DataDecisionMakers</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/77WjI7ALpxOD2JSAUGMDRD/e938cb7b3827956c6043438c7af3f0d6/Velocity_gap.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Is vibe coding ruining a generation of engineers?]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-vibe-coding-ruining-a-generation-of-engineers</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">2K9Epk5ajBYAQgO7NVCFFE</guid>\n            <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>AI tools are revolutionizing <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/replacing-coders-with-ai-why-bill-gates-sam-altman-and-experience-say-you\">software development</a> by automating repetitive tasks, refactoring bloated code, and identifying bugs in real-time. Developers can now generate well-structured code from plain language prompts, saving hours of manual effort. These tools learn from vast codebases, offering context-aware recommendations that enhance productivity and reduce errors. Rather than starting from scratch, engineers can prototype quickly, iterate faster and focus on solving increasingly complex problems.</p><p>As code generation tools grow in popularity, they raise questions about the future size and structure of engineering teams. Earlier this year, Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, noted that about one-quarter of its current clients use AI to write 95% or more of their software.<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/15/y-combinator-startups-are-fastest-growing-in-fund-history-because-of-ai.html\"> <u>In an interview with CNBC</u></a>, Tan said: “What that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers, you don’t have to raise as much. The capital goes much longer.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html\"><u>AI-powered coding</u></a> may offer a fast solution for businesses under budget pressure — but its long-term effects on the field and labor pool cannot be ignored.</p><h2>As AI-powered coding rises, human expertise may diminish</h2><p><b>\n</b>In the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that\">era of AI</a>, the traditional journey to coding expertise that has long supported senior developers may be at risk. Easy access to large language models (LLMs) enables junior coders to quickly identify issues in code. While this speeds up software development, it can distance developers from their own work, delaying the growth of core problem-solving skills. As a result, they may avoid the focused, sometimes uncomfortable hours required to build expertise and progress on the path to becoming successful senior developers.</p><p>Consider <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-can-now-process-entire-software-projects-in-single-request-anthropic-says\">Anthropic’s Claude Code</a>, a terminal-based assistant built on the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which automates bug detection and resolution, test creation and code refactoring. Using natural language commands, it reduces repetitive manual work and boosts productivity.</p><p>Microsoft has also released two open-source frameworks — <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-retires-autogen-and-debuts-agent-framework-to-unify-and-govern\">AutoGen and Semantic Kernel</a> — to support the development of agentic AI systems. AutoGen enables asynchronous messaging, modular components, and distributed agent collaboration to build complex workflows with minimal human input. Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates LLMs with languages like C#, Python and Java, letting developers build AI agents to automate tasks and manage enterprise applications.</p><p>The increasing availability of these tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and others may reduce opportunities for coders to refine and deepen their skills. Rather than “banging their heads against the wall” to debug a few lines or select a library to unlock new features, junior developers may simply turn to AI for an assist. This means senior coders with problem-solving skills honed over decades may become an endangered species.</p><p>Overreliance on AI for writing code risks weakening developers’ hands-on experience and understanding of key programming concepts. Without regular practice, they may struggle to independently debug, optimize or design systems. Ultimately, this erosion of skill can undermine critical thinking, creativity and adaptability — qualities that are essential not just for coding, but for assessing the quality and logic of AI-generated solutions.</p><h2>AI as mentor: Turning code automation into hands-on learning</h2><p>While concerns about AI diminishing human developer skills are valid, businesses shouldn’t dismiss AI-supported coding. They just need to think carefully about when and how to deploy AI tools in development. These tools can be more than productivity boosters; they can act as interactive mentors, guiding coders in real time with explanations, alternatives and best practices.</p><p>When u<!-- -->sed as a training tool, AI can reinforce learning by showing coders why code is broken and how to fix it—rather than simply applying a solution. For example, a junior developer using Claude Code might receive immediate feedback on inefficient syntax or logic errors, along with suggestions linked to detailed explanations. This enables active learning, not passive correction. It’s a win-win: Accelerating project timelines without doing all the work for junior coders.</p><p>Additionally, coding frameworks can support experimentation by letting developers prototype agent workflows or integrate LLMs without needing expert-level knowledge upfront. By observing how AI builds and refines code, junior developers who actively engage with these tools can internalize patterns, architectural decisions and debugging strategies — mirroring the traditional learning process of trial and error, code reviews and mentorship.</p><p>However, AI coding assistants shouldn’t replace real mentorship or pair programming. Pull requests and formal code reviews remain essential for guiding newer, less experienced team members. We are nowhere near the point at which AI can single-handedly upskill a junior developer.</p><p>Companies and educators can build structured development programs around these tools that emphasize code comprehension to ensure AI is used as a training partner rather than a crutch. This encourages coders to question AI outputs and requires manual refactoring exercises. In this way, AI becomes less of a replacement for human ingenuity and more of a catalyst for accelerated, experiential learning.</p><h2>Bridging the gap between automation and education</h2><p>When utilized with intention, AI doesn’t just write code; it teaches coding, blending automation with education to prepare developers for a future where deep understanding and adaptability remain indispensable.</p><p>By embracing AI as a mentor, as a programming partner and as a team of developers we can direct to the problem at hand, we can bridge the gap between effective automation and education. We can empower developers to grow alongside the tools they use. We can ensure that, as AI evolves, so too does the human skill set, fostering a generation of coders who are both efficient and deeply knowledgeable.</p><p><i>Richard Sonnenblick is chief data scientist at </i><a href=\"https://www.planview.com/\"><i>Planview</i></a><i>. </i></p>]]></description>\n            <author>planview@matternow.com (Richard Sonnenblick, Planview)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>DataDecisionMakers</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/6O2FgBkLOdYG0bQrbbceee/70c01c9a6f6498e1888781c6ec759dd8/Junior_coders.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[When dirt meets data: ScottsMiracle-Gro saved $150M using AI]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/when-dirt-meets-data-scottsmiracle-gro</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3gseMvS6Xrp7pjDmyrX6ng</guid>\n            <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage </b></p><p>For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”</p><p>Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.</p><h2><b>The AI revolution finds an unexpected leader</b></h2><p>Enterprise AI has been led by predictable players. Software companies with cloud-native architectures. Financial services firms with vast data lakes. Retailers with rich digital touchpoints. Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.</p><p>Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.</p><p><b>A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil science</b></p><p>Baxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.</p><p>“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023. The company was reeling from a collapsed $1.2 billion hydroponics investment and facing what he describes as “pressure from a leverage standpoint.”</p><p>His wife challenged him with a direct prompt. If you are not learning or putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, you should change that.</p><p>Baxter saw clear parallels between semiconductor manufacturing and SMG’s operations. Both require precision, quality control, and the optimization of complex systems. He also saw untapped potential in SMG’s domain knowledge. One hundred fifty years of horticultural expertise, regulatory know-how, and customer insight had never been fully digitized.</p><p>“It became apparent to me whether it was on the backend with data analytics, business process transformation, and obviously now with AI being front and center of the consumer experience, a lot of opportunities are there,” he explains.</p><h2><b>The declaration that changed everything</b></h2><p>The pivot began at an all-hands meeting. “I just said, you know, guys, we’re a tech company. You just don’t know it yet,” Baxter recalls. “There’s so much opportunity here to drive this company to where it needs to go.”</p><p>The first challenge was organizational. SMG had evolved into functional silos. IT, supply chain, and brand teams ran independent systems with little coordination. Drawing on his experience with complex technology organizations, Baxter restructured the consumer business into three business units. General managers became accountable not just for financial results but also for technology implementation within their domains.</p><p>“I came in and said, we’re going to create new business units,” he explains. “The buck stops with you and I’m holding you accountable not only for the business results, for the quality of the creative and marketing, but for the implementation of technology.”</p><p>To support the new structure, SMG set up centers of excellence for digital capabilities, insights and analytics, and creative functions. The hybrid design placed centralized expertise behind distributed accountability.</p><h2><b>Mining corporate memory for AI gold</b></h2><p>Turning legacy knowledge into machine-ready intelligence required what Fausto Fleites, VP of Data Intelligence, calls “archaeological work.” The team excavated decades of business logic embedded in legacy SAP systems and converted filing cabinets of research into AI-ready datasets. Fleites, a Cuban immigrant with a doctorate from FIU who led Florida’s public hurricane loss model before roles at Sears and Cemex, understood the stakes.</p><p>“The costly part of the migration was the business reporting layer we have in SAP Business Warehouse,” Fleites explains. “You need to uncover business logic created in many cases over decades.”</p><p>SMG chose Databricks as its unified data platform. The team had Apache Spark expertise. Databricks offered strong SAP integration and aligned with a preference for open-source technologies that minimize vendor lock-in.</p><p>The breakthrough came through systematic knowledge management. SMG built an AI bot using Google’s Gemini large language model to catalog and clean internal repositories. The system identified duplicates, grouped content by topic, and restructured information for AI consumption. The effort reduced knowledge articles by 30 percent while increasing their utility.</p><p>“We used Gemini LLMs to actually categorize them into topics, find similar documents,” Fleites explains. A hybrid approach that combined modern AI with techniques like cosine similarity became the foundation for later applications.</p><h2><b>Building AI systems that actually understand fertilizer</b></h2><p>Early trials with off-the-shelf AI exposed a real risk. General-purpose models confused products designed for killing weeds with those for preventing them. That mistake can ruin a lawn.</p><p>“Different products, if you use one in the wrong place, would actually have a very negative outcome,” Fleites notes. “But those are kind of synonyms in certain contexts to the LLM. So they were recommending the wrong products.”</p><p>The solution was a new architecture. SMG created what Fleites calls a “hierarchy of agents.” A supervisor agent routes queries to specialized worker agents organized by brand. Each agent draws on deep product knowledge encoded from a 400-page internal training manual.</p><p>The system also changes the conversation. When users ask for recommendations, the agents start with questions about location, goals, and lawn conditions. They narrow possibilities step by step before offering suggestions. The stack integrates with APIs for product availability and state-specific regulatory compliance.</p><p><b>From drones to demand forecasting across the enterprise</b></p><p>The transformation runs across the company. Drones measure inventory piles. Demand forecasting models analyze more than 60 factors, including weather patterns, consumer sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.</p><p>These predictions enable faster moves. When drought struck Texas, the models supported a shift in promotional spending to regions with favorable weather. The reallocation helped drive positive quarterly results.</p><p>“We not only have the ability to move marketing and promotion dollars around, but we’ve even gotten to the point where if it’s going to be a big weekend in the Northeast, we’ll shift our field sales resources from other regions up there,” Baxter explains.</p><p>Consumer Services changed as well. AI agents now process incoming emails through Salesforce, draft responses based on the knowledge base, and flag them for brief human review. Draft times dropped from ten minutes to seconds and response quality improved.</p><p>The company emphasizes explainable AI. Using SHAP, SMG built dashboards that decompose each forecast and show how weather, promotions, or media spending contribute to predictions.</p><p>“Typically, if you open a prediction to a business person and you don’t say why, they’ll say, ‘I don’t believe you,’” Fleites explains. Transparency made it possible to move resource allocation from quarterly to weekly cycles.</p><h2><b>Competing like a startup</b></h2><p>SMG’s results challenge assumptions about AI readiness in traditional industries. The advantage does not come from owning the most sophisticated models. It comes from combining general-purpose AI with unique, structured domain knowledge.</p><p>“LLMs are going to be a commodity,” Fleites observes. “The strategic differentiator is what is the additional level of [internal] knowledge we can fit to them.”</p><p>Partnerships are central. SMG works with Google Vertex AI for foundational models, Sierra.ai for production-ready conversational agents, and Kindwise for computer vision. The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.</p><p>Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.</p><p>“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”</p><p>Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.</p><h2><b>When innovation meets immovable objects</b></h2><p>Not every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.</p><p>“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.</p><p>“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”</p><p>The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.</p><h2><b>The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futures</b></h2><p>The roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.</p><p>The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.</p><p>SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.</p><h2><b>What traditional industries can learn</b></h2><p>ScottsMiracle-Gro&#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&#x27;t easily replicate.</p><p>By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.</p><p>Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.</p><p>“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>james@thomason.io (James Thomason)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/7d0hJ4qtWTk5GaypvPfHJY/53aa8c26a39b5f10e16b3073dd73a388/videoframe_878.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Together AI's ATLAS adaptive speculator delivers 400% inference speedup by learning from workloads in real-time]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/together-ais-atlas-adaptive-speculator-delivers-400-inference-speedup-by</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6mM7lVKT3gElikm19oiLGu</guid>\n            <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Enterprises expanding AI deployments are hitting an invisible performance wall. The culprit? Static speculators that can&#x27;t keep up with shifting workloads.</p><p>Speculators are smaller AI models that work alongside large language models during inference. They draft multiple tokens ahead, which the main model then verifies in parallel. This technique (called speculative decoding) has become essential for enterprises trying to reduce inference costs and latency. Instead of generating tokens one at a time, the system can accept multiple tokens at once, dramatically improving throughput.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.together.ai/\"><u>Together AI</u></a> today announced research and a new system called ATLAS (AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System) that aims to help enterprises overcome the challenge of static speculators. The technique provides a self-learning inference optimization capability that can help to deliver up to 400% faster inference performance than a baseline level of performance available in existing inference technologies such as vLLM.. The system addresses a critical problem: as AI workloads evolve, inference speeds degrade, even with specialized speculators in place.</p><p>The company which<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-startup-together-raises-funding-for-open-source-ai-and-cloud-platform\"> <u>got its start</u></a> in 2023, has been focused on<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/together-ai-promises-faster-inference-and-lower-costs-with-enterprise-ai-platform-for-private-cloud\"> <u>optimizing inference</u></a> on its enterprise AI platform. Earlier this year the company<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/together-ais-305m-bet-reasoning-models-like-deepseek-r1-are-increasing-not-decreasing-gpu-demand\"> <u>raised $305 million</u></a> as customer adoption and demand has grown.</p><p>&quot;Companies we work with generally, as they scale up, they see shifting workloads, and then they don&#x27;t see as much speedup from speculative execution as before,&quot; Tri Dao, chief scientist at Together AI, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. &quot;These speculators generally don&#x27;t work well when their workload domain starts to shift.&quot;</p><h2>The workload drift problem no one talks about</h2><p>Most speculators in production today are &quot;static&quot; models. They&#x27;re trained once on a fixed dataset representing expected workloads, then deployed without any ability to adapt. Companies like Meta and Mistral ship pre-trained speculators alongside their main models. Inference platforms like vLLM use these static speculators to boost throughput without changing output quality.</p><p>But there&#x27;s a catch. When an enterprise&#x27;s AI usage evolves the static speculator&#x27;s accuracy plummets.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re a company producing coding agents, and most of your developers have been writing in Python, all of a sudden some of them switch to writing Rust or C, then you see the speed starts to go down,&quot; Dao explained. &quot;The speculator has a mismatch between what it was trained on versus what the actual workload is.&quot;</p><p>This workload drift represents a hidden tax on scaling AI. Enterprises either accept degraded performance or invest in retraining custom speculators. That process captures only a snapshot in time and quickly becomes outdated.</p><h2>How adaptive speculators work: A dual-model approach</h2><p>ATLAS uses a dual-speculator architecture that combines stability with adaptation:</p><p><b>The static speculator</b> - A heavyweight model trained on broad data provides consistent baseline performance. It serves as a &quot;speed floor.&quot;</p><p><b>The adaptive speculator</b> - A lightweight model learns continuously from live traffic. It specializes on-the-fly to emerging domains and usage patterns.</p><p><b>The confidence-aware controller</b> - An orchestration layer dynamically chooses which speculator to use. It adjusts the speculation &quot;lookahead&quot; based on confidence scores.</p><p>&quot;Before the adaptive speculator learns anything, we still have the static speculator to help provide the speed boost in the beginning,&quot; Ben Athiwaratkun, staff AI scientist at Together AI explained to VentureBeat. &quot;Once the adaptive speculator becomes more confident, then the speed grows over time.&quot;</p><p>The technical innovation lies in balancing acceptance rate (how often the target model agrees with drafted tokens) and draft latency. As the adaptive model learns from traffic patterns, the controller relies more on the lightweight speculator and extends lookahead. This compounds performance gains.</p><p>Users don&#x27;t need to tune any parameters. &quot;On the user side, users don&#x27;t have to turn any knobs,&quot; Dao said. &quot;On our side, we have turned these knobs for users to adjust in a configuration that gets good speedup.&quot;</p><h2>Performance that rivals custom silicon</h2><p>Together AI&#x27;s testing shows ATLAS reaching 500 tokens per second on DeepSeek-V3.1 when fully adapted. More impressively, those numbers on Nvidia B200 GPUs match or exceed specialized inference chips like<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/groq-just-made-hugging-face-way-faster-and-its-coming-for-aws-and-google\"> <u>Groq&#x27;s</u></a> custom hardware.</p><p>&quot;The software and algorithmic improvement is able to close the gap with really specialized hardware,&quot; Dao said. &quot;We were seeing 500 tokens per second on these huge models that are even faster than some of the customized chips.&quot;</p><p>The 400% speedup that the company claims for inference represents the cumulative effect of Together&#x27;s Turbo optimization suite. FP4 quantization delivers 80% speedup over FP8 baseline. The static Turbo Speculator adds another 80-100% gain. The adaptive system layers on top. Each optimization compounds the benefits of the others.</p><p>Compared to standard inference engines like<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-snowflakes-open-source-text-to-sql-and-arctic-inference-models-solve-enterprise-ais-two-biggest-deployment-headaches\"> <u>vLLM</u></a> or Nvidia&#x27;s TensorRT-LLM, the improvement is substantial. Together AI benchmarks against the stronger baseline between the two for each workload before applying speculative optimizations.</p><h2>The memory-compute tradeoff explained</h2><p>The performance gains stem from exploiting a fundamental inefficiency in modern inference: wasted compute capacity.</p><p>Dao explained that typically during inference, much of the compute power is not fully utilized.</p><p>&quot;During inference, which is actually the dominant workload nowadays, you&#x27;re mostly using the memory subsystem,&quot; he said.</p><p>Speculative decoding trades idle compute for reduced memory access. When a model generates one token at a time, it&#x27;s memory-bound. The GPU sits idle while waiting for memory. But when the speculator proposes five tokens and the target model verifies them simultaneously, compute utilization spikes while memory access remains roughly constant.</p><p>&quot;The total amount of compute to generate five tokens is the same, but you only had to access memory once, instead of five times,&quot; Dao said.</p><h2>Think of it as intelligent caching for AI</h2><p>For infrastructure teams familiar with traditional database optimization, adaptive speculators function like an intelligent caching layer, but with a crucial difference.</p><p>Traditional caching systems like Redis or memcached require exact matches. You store the exact same query result and retrieve it when that specific query runs again. Adaptive speculators work differently.</p><p>&quot;You can view it as an intelligent way of caching, not storing exactly, but figuring out some patterns that you see,&quot; Dao explained. &quot;Broadly, we&#x27;re observing that you&#x27;re working with similar code, or working with similar, you know, controlling compute in a similar way. We can then predict what the big model is going to say. We just get better and better at predicting that.&quot;</p><p>Rather than storing exact responses, the system learns patterns in how the model generates tokens. It recognizes that if you&#x27;re editing Python files in a specific codebase, certain token sequences become more likely. The speculator adapts to those patterns, improving its predictions over time without requiring identical inputs.</p><h2>Use cases: RL training and evolving workloads</h2><p>Two enterprise scenarios particularly benefit from adaptive speculators:</p><p><b>Reinforcement learning training</b>: Static speculators quickly fall out of alignment as the policy evolves during training. ATLAS adapts continuously to the shifting policy distribution.</p><p><b>Evolving workloads</b>: As enterprises discover new AI use cases, workload composition shifts. &quot;Maybe they started using AI for chatbots, but then they realized, hey, it can write code, so they start shifting to code,&quot; Dao said. &quot;Or they realize these AIs can actually call tools and control computers and do accounting and things like that.&quot;</p><p>In a vibe-coding session, the adaptive system can specialize for the specific codebase being edited. These are files not seen during training. This further increases acceptance rates and decoding speed.</p><h2>What it means for enterprises and the inference ecosystem</h2><p>ATLAS is available now on Together AI&#x27;s dedicated endpoints as part of the platform at no additional cost. The company&#x27;s 800,000-plus developers (up from 450,000 in February) have access to the optimization.</p><p>But the broader implications extend beyond one vendor&#x27;s product. The shift from static to adaptive optimization represents a fundamental rethinking of how inference platforms should work. As enterprises deploy AI across multiple domains, the industry will need to move beyond one-time trained models toward systems that learn and improve continuously.</p><p>Together AI has historically released some of its research techniques as open source and collaborated with projects like vLLM. While the fully integrated ATLAS system is proprietary, some of the underlying techniques may eventually influence the broader inference ecosystem. </p><p>For enterprises looking to lead in AI, the message is clear: adaptive algorithms on commodity hardware can match custom silicon at a fraction of the cost. As this approach matures across the industry, software optimization increasingly trumps specialized hardware.</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/QKYmkzNToGEJHgfWYSkzb/8dca1ce8a9cecbd949cb5dabb0e4a54b/ATLAS-ai-inference-smk.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpg\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Will updating your AI agents help or hamper their performance?

Enterprises are hard pressed to keep up with the massive pace of change, let alone understand how to adapt to it — which of these new models should they adopt, if any, to power their workflows and the custom AI agents they&#x27;re building to carry them out? </p><p>Help has arrived: <b>AI applications observability startup </b><a href=\"https://www.raindrop.ai/\"><b>Raindrop</b></a><b> has launched Experiments</b>, a new analytics feature that the company describes as the first A/B testing suite designed specifically for enterprise AI agents — allowing companies to see and compare how updating agents to new underlying models, or changing their instructions and tool access, will impact their performance with real end users. </p><p>The release extends Raindrop’s existing observability tools, giving developers and teams a way to see how their agents behave and evolve in real-world conditions.</p><p>With Experiments, teams can track how changes — such as a new tool, prompt, model update, or full pipeline refactor — affect AI performance across millions of user interactions. The new feature is available now for users on Raindrop’s Pro subscription plan ($350 monthly) at <a href=\"https://www.raindrop.ai\">raindrop.ai</a>. </p><div></div><h3><b>A Data-Driven Lens on Agent Development</b></h3><p>Raindrop co-founder and chief technology officer <b>Ben Hylak</b> noted in a product announcement video (above) that Experiments helps teams see “how literally anything changed,” including tool usage, user intents, and issue rates, and to explore differences by demographic factors such as language. The goal is to make model iteration more transparent and measurable.</p><p>The Experiments interface presents results visually, showing when an experiment performs better or worse than its baseline. Increases in negative signals might indicate higher task failure or partial code output, while improvements in positive signals could reflect more complete responses or better user experiences.</p><p>By making this data easy to interpret, Raindrop encourages AI teams to approach agent iteration with the same rigor as modern software deployment—tracking outcomes, sharing insights, and addressing regressions before they compound.</p><h3><b>Background: From AI Observability to Experimentation</b></h3><p>Raindrop’s launch of Experiments builds on the company’s foundation as one of the first <b>AI-native observability platforms</b>, designed to help enterprises monitor and understand how their generative AI systems behave in production. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-your-ai-app-pissing-off-users-or-going-off-script-raindrop-emerges-with-ai-native-observability-platform-to-monitor-performance\">VentureBeat reported earlier this year</a>, the company — originally known as Dawn AI — emerged to address what Hylak<b>, </b>a former Apple human interface designer, called the “black box problem” of AI performance, helping teams catch failures “as they happen and explain to enterprises what went wrong and why.&quot; </p><p>At the time, Hylak described how “AI products fail constantly—in ways both hilarious and terrifying,” noting that unlike traditional software, which throws clear exceptions, “AI products fail silently.” Raindrop’s original platform focused on detecting those silent failures by analyzing signals such as user feedback, task failures, refusals, and other conversational anomalies across millions of daily events.</p><p>The company’s co-founders—  Hylak, <b>Alexis Gauba</b>, and <b>Zubin Singh Koticha </b>— built Raindrop after encountering firsthand the difficulty of debugging AI systems in production. </p><p>“We started by building AI products, not infrastructure,” Hylak told <i>VentureBeat</i>. “But pretty quickly, we saw that to grow anything serious, we needed tooling to understand AI behavior—and that tooling didn’t exist.”</p><p>With Experiments, Raindrop extends that same mission from <b>detecting failures</b> to <b>measuring improvements</b>. The new tool transforms observability data into actionable comparisons, letting enterprises test whether changes to their models, prompts, or pipelines actually make their AI agents better—or just different.</p><h3><b>Solving the “Evals Pass, Agents Fail” Problem</b></h3><p>Traditional evaluation frameworks, while useful for benchmarking, rarely capture the unpredictable behavior of AI agents operating in dynamic environments. </p><p>As Raindrop co-founder <b>Alexis Gauba</b> explained in her <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexisgauba_were-excited-to-announce-raindrop-experiments-ugcPost-7382156367463100417-s2kF/\">LinkedIn announcement</a>, “Traditional evals don’t really answer this question. They’re great unit tests, but you can’t predict your user’s actions and your agent is running for hours, calling hundreds of tools.”</p><p><b>Gauba said the company consistently heard a common frustration from teams: “Evals pass, agents fail.”</b></p><p>Experiments is meant to close that gap by showing <i>what actually changes</i> when developers ship updates to their systems. </p><p>The tool enables side-by-side comparisons of models, tools, intents, or properties, surfacing measurable differences in behavior and performance.</p><h3><b>Designed for Real-World AI Behavior</b></h3><p>In the announcement video, Raindrop described Experiments as a way to “compare anything and measure how your agent’s behavior actually changed in production across millions of real interactions.”</p><p>The platform helps users spot issues such as task failure spikes, forgetting, or new tools that trigger unexpected errors. </p><p>It can also be used in reverse — starting from a known problem, such as an “agent stuck in a loop,” and tracing back to which model, tool, or flag is driving it. </p><p>From there, developers can dive into detailed traces to find the root cause and ship a fix quickly.</p><p>Each experiment provides a visual breakdown of metrics like tool usage frequency, error rates, conversation duration, and response length. </p><p>Users can click on any comparison to access the underlying event data, giving them a clear view of how agent behavior changed over time. Shared links make it easy to collaborate with teammates or report findings.</p><h3><b>Integration, Scalability, and Accuracy</b></h3><p>According to Hylak, Experiments integrates directly with “the feature flag platforms companies know and love (like Statsig!)” and is designed to work seamlessly with existing telemetry and analytics pipelines. </p><p>For companies without those integrations, it can still compare performance over time—such as yesterday versus today—without additional setup.</p><p>Hylak said teams typically need around 2,000 users per day to produce statistically meaningful results. </p><p>To ensure the accuracy of comparisons, Experiments monitors for sample size adequacy and alerts users if a test lacks enough data to draw valid conclusions.</p><p>“We obsess over making sure metrics like Task Failure and User Frustration are metrics that you’d wake up an on-call engineer for,” Hylak explained. He added that teams can drill into the specific conversations or events that drive those metrics, ensuring transparency behind every aggregate number.</p><h3><b>Security and Data Protection</b></h3><p>Raindrop operates as a cloud-hosted platform but also offers on-premise personally identifiable information (PII) redaction for enterprises that need additional control. </p><p>Hylak said the company is SOC 2 compliant and has launched a <b>PII Guard</b> feature that uses AI to automatically remove sensitive information from stored data. “We take protecting customer data very seriously,” he emphasized.</p><h3><b>Pricing and Plans</b></h3><p>Experiments is part of Raindrop’s <b>Pro plan</b>, which costs $350 per month or $0.0007 per interaction. The Pro tier also includes deep research tools, topic clustering, custom issue tracking, and semantic search capabilities.</p><p>Raindrop’s <b>Starter plan </b>— $65 per month or $0.001 per interaction — offers core analytics including issue detection, user feedback signals, Slack alerts, and user tracking. Both plans come with a 14-day free trial.</p><p>Larger organizations can opt for an <b>Enterprise plan</b> with custom pricing and advanced features like SSO login, custom alerts, integrations, edge-PII redaction, and priority support.</p><h3><b>Continuous Improvement for AI Systems</b></h3><p>With Experiments, Raindrop positions itself at the intersection of AI analytics and software observability. Its focus on “measure truth,” as stated in the product video, reflects a broader push within the industry toward accountability and transparency in AI operations.</p><p>Rather than relying solely on offline benchmarks, Raindrop’s approach emphasizes real user data and contextual understanding. The company hopes this will allow AI developers to move faster, identify root causes sooner, and ship better-performing models with confidence. </p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/6wvVdQj4t7NiC0a8xS9bQu/8b37da63cebde173a1c338aeb371eba8/cfr0z3n_sharp_detailed_graphic_novel_style_splash_page_bicolore_b6659495-c268-49de-9a52-76abb547bf5a.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Nvidia researchers boost LLMs reasoning skills by getting them to 'think' during pre-training]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-researchers-boost-llms-reasoning-skills-by-getting-them-to-think</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6sAYbp5vHWdIPPjCEMCzMJ</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at Nvidia have developed a new technique that flips the script on how large language models (LLMs) learn to reason. </p><p>The method, called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01265\"><u>reinforcement learning pre-training</u></a> (RLP), integrates RL into the initial training phase rather than saving it for the end.</p><p>This approach <b>encourages the model to “think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining,”</b> the researchers state in their paper. </p><p>By learning to reason on plain text without needing external verifiers, <b>models trained with RLP show significant improvements in learning complex reasoning tasks</b> downstream, hinting at a future of more capable and adaptable AI for real-world tasks.</p><h3><b>The typical LLM training cycle</b></h3><p>Typically, large language models are first pre-trained on vast amounts of text using a &quot;next-token prediction&quot; objective, where they are given a string of text and asked to continuously guess what the next word (or token) will be. In this phase, they learn grammar, facts, and basic associations.</p><p>In the later post-training phase, models usually learn complex reasoning abilities such as <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-technique-helps-llms-rein-in-cot-lengths-optimizing-reasoning-without-exploding-compute-costs\"><u>chain-of-thought</u></a> (CoT) where a model lays out its reasoning step-by-step. This stage often involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-is-unlocking-the-power-of-generative-ai\"><u>reinforcement learning from human feedback</u></a> (RLHF), which require specialized, curated datasets.</p><p>The paper’s authors argue this sequential process does not match human comprehension, which is “not a linear token-by-token process, but rather a parallel integration of input with prior knowledge.” Existing pre-training methods lack this mechanism, hindering a model&#x27;s ability to develop deep reasoning from the start.</p><h3><b>How reinforcement learning pre-training works</b></h3><p>RLP reframes this process by treating CoT generation as an action the model takes before predicting the next token. At each step, the model first generates an internal &quot;thought&quot; or reasoning chain. It then predicts the next word in the text, using the original context augmented with its new thought.</p><p>The model receives a reward based on how much its thought improved the accuracy of its prediction compared to a baseline that didn&#x27;t generate a thought (pure next-token prediction). This reward signal is calculated automatically based on the change in probability, eliminating the need for external verifiers or human-labeled data. </p><p>The reward is positive only when the generated thought helps the model better predict the next token. By rewarding thoughts based on their predictive benefit, RLP effectively teaches the model how to think usefully on the same massive, unstructured datasets used for standard pre-training. </p><p>This continuous feedback loop allows the model to learn when a simple predictive guess is sufficient and when it needs to engage in deeper reasoning. As the researchers put it, “RLP is designed to shape thinking in base models by <b>rewarding only those thoughts that measurably help next-token prediction.”</b></p><p>This foundational approach, however, doesn&#x27;t make later fine-tuning stages obsolete. According to Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research at Nvidia and a co-author of the paper, RLP is designed to complement, not replace, these crucial steps. &quot;RLP isn’t meant to replace the later post-training stages like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback,&quot; Catanzaro told VentureBeat. &quot;Those stages remain crucial for refining model behavior... It’s really designed to amplify the effectiveness of those later phases by giving the model a head start.&quot;</p><h3><b>RLP in action</b></h3><p>In experiments with <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-launches-open-source-qwen3-model-that-surpasses-openai-o1-and-deepseek-r1\"><u>Qwen3-1.7B</u></a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-releases-a-new-small-open-model-nemotron-nano-9b-v2-with-toggle-on-off-reasoning\"><u>Nemotron-Nano-12B</u></a>, Nvidia’s team tested RLP across a suite of math and science reasoning benchmarks. The results show that<b> models enhanced with RLP consistently outperformed their conventionally trained counterparts, with particularly strong gains in reasoning-heavy tasks. </b></p><p>For an enterprise, this improved reasoning could translate to more reliable outputs in multi-step workflows like financial analysis or legal document summarization.</p><p>&quot;RLP encourages the model during pretraining to think before it predicts, helping the model internalize a more coherent reasoning style,&quot; said Catanzaro. &quot;This could help reduce subtle logical errors, especially in longer workflows.” </p><p>While stressing that RLP-trained models will still need the usual guardrails such as verification layers, human oversight, and consistency checks, Catanzaro said that “RLP gives you a stronger baseline.&quot;</p><p>Importantly, the benefits of RLP compound instead of disappearing during subsequent fine-tuning stages (catastrophic forgetting is a common problem in LLM training, where later training stages cause the model to forget its previously learned skills and knowledge). The RLP-trained model achieved an overall score that was 7-8% higher than baselines after an identical post-training regimen. The researchers conclude that RLP “establishes robust reasoning foundations that are not washed out by downstream alignment but instead compound with post-training.”</p><p>The efficiency of the technique is a key finding. On the Qwen3-1.7B model, RLP improved performance by 17% over standard continuous pre-training and also beat a similar technique called Reinforcement Pretraining via prefix-matching rewards (RPT). This advantage held even when the baseline model was trained with 35 times more data to match the computational cost, confirming the gains come from the method itself, not just more processing.</p><p>Furthermore, RLP demonstrates impressive scalability and versatility, successfully extracting a reasoning signal from general-purpose web data—not just curated datasets. When applied to the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model Nemotron-Nano-12B, <b>RLP achieved a 35% relative improvement over a heavily trained baseline</b> while using just a tiny fraction of the data.</p><p>While these results point toward a more efficient path for building powerful models, Catanzaro frames the innovation as a fundamental shift in the learning process itself, rather than an immediate solution to high training costs. </p><p>&quot;This research is exciting because it offers a shift in how models absorb information during pretraining leading to a smarter learning process,&quot; he explained. &quot;It wouldn’t replace large-scale pretraining, but offer another creative method in building the best possible models.&quot;</p><h3><b>A new foundation for AI training</b></h3><p>Ultimately, RLP points toward a future where pre-training is no longer a monolithic process of next-token prediction. Instead, the next generation of models could be built on a hybrid of objectives, creating AI that learns to think more robustly from day one. Catanzaro offers a powerful analogy to frame this shift:</p><p>&quot;Next-token prediction teaches a model what the world looks like; reinforcement-style objectives like RLP can teach it how to think about what it’s seeing,&quot; he said. &quot;The combination of these two objectives could help models develop deeper, more structured thinking much earlier in training... Tools like RLP can build on top of that foundation, making learning more active, curious, and even more efficient.&quot;</p><p>There is still a lot to learn about the dynamics of reinforcement learning in the pre-training phase, but what seems clear is that “introducing exploration earlier in training opens a new axis for scaling — not just in size, but in how models learn to reason,” Catanzaro said.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>bendee983@gmail.com (Ben Dickson)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2PTqNZnnwoy3Jnl9Nb0jwP/bceecea29350a1a5646c728208c5baac/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_a_robot_thinking_neon_colors_bc248938-48f9-44e0-8bd0-3a2fd7b9f913.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Echelon's AI agents take aim at Accenture and Deloitte consulting models]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/echelons-ai-agents-take-aim-at-accenture-and-deloitte-consulting-models</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">rcupMZb6jRrX4fgMtkqHp</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/\"><u>Echelon</u></a>, an artificial intelligence startup that automates enterprise software implementations, emerged from stealth mode today with $4.75 million in seed funding led by <a href=\"https://baincapitalventures.com/\"><u>Bain Capital Ventures</u></a>, targeting a fundamental shift in how companies deploy and maintain critical business systems.</p><p>The San Francisco-based company has developed AI agents specifically trained to handle end-to-end <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a> implementations — complex enterprise software deployments that traditionally require months of work by offshore consulting teams and cost companies millions of dollars annually.</p><p>&quot;The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn&#x27;t technology — it&#x27;s the time it takes to implement it,&quot; said Rahul Kayala, Echelon&#x27;s founder and CEO, who previously worked at AI-powered IT company <a href=\"https://www.moveworks.com/\"><u>Moveworks</u></a>. &quot;AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed.&quot;</p><p>The announcement signals a potential disruption to the<a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/global-ai-spending-trillions-cloud-infrastructure-software-gartner/760303/\"><u> $1.5 trillion global IT services market</u></a>, where companies like <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/\"><u>Accenture</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en.html\"><u>Deloitte</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/\"><u>Capgemini</u></a> have long dominated through labor-intensive consulting models that Echelon argues are becoming obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.</p><h2><b>Why ServiceNow deployments take months and cost millions</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a>, a cloud-based platform used by enterprises to manage IT services, human resources, and business workflows, has become critical infrastructure for large organizations. However, implementing and customizing the platform typically requires specialized expertise that most companies lack internally.</p><p>The complexity stems from ServiceNow&#x27;s vast customization capabilities. Organizations often need hundreds of &quot;<a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/blog/service-catalog-migration\"><u>catalog items</u></a>&quot; — digital forms and workflows for employee requests — each requiring specific configurations, approval processes, and integrations with existing systems. According to Echelon&#x27;s research, these implementations frequently stretch far beyond planned timelines due to technical complexity and communication bottlenecks between business stakeholders and development teams.</p><p>&quot;What starts out simple often turns into weeks of effort once the actual work begins,&quot; the company noted in its <a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/blog/service-catalog-migration\"><u>analysis of common implementation challenges</u></a>. &quot;A basic request form turns out to be five requests stuffed into one. We had catalog items with 50+ variables, 10 or more UI policies, all connected. Update one field, and something else would break.&quot;</p><p>The traditional solution involves hiring offshore development teams or expensive consultants, creating what Echelon describes as a problematic cycle: &quot;One question here, one delay there, and suddenly you&#x27;re weeks behind.&quot;</p><h2><b>How AI agents replace expensive offshore consulting teams</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s approach replaces human consultants with AI agents trained by elite <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a> experts from top consulting firms. These agents can analyze business requirements, ask clarifying questions in real-time, and automatically generate complete ServiceNow configurations including forms, workflows, testing scenarios, and documentation.</p><p>The technology delivers a significant advancement from general-purpose AI tools. Rather than providing generic code suggestions, Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s specific architecture, best practices, and common integration patterns. They can identify gaps in requirements and propose solutions that align with enterprise governance standards.</p><p>&quot;Instead of routing every piece of input through five people, the business process owner directly uploaded their requirements,&quot; Kayala explained, describing a recent customer implementation. &quot;The AI developer analyzes it and asks follow-up questions like: &#x27;I see a process flow with 3 branches, but only 2 triggers. Should there be a 3rd?&#x27; The kinds of things a seasoned developer would ask. With AI, these questions came instantly.&quot;</p><p>Early customers report dramatic time savings. One financial services company saw a service catalog migration project that was projected to take six months <a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/\"><u>completed in six weeks</u></a> using Echelon&#x27;s AI agents.</p><h2><b>What makes Echelon&#x27;s AI different from coding assistants</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s technology addresses several technical challenges that have prevented broader AI adoption in enterprise software implementation. The agents are trained not just on ServiceNow&#x27;s technical capabilities but on the accumulated expertise of senior consultants who understand complex enterprise requirements, governance frameworks, and integration patterns.</p><p>This approach differs from general-purpose AI coding assistants like <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, which provide syntax suggestions but lack domain-specific expertise. Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s data models, security frameworks, and upgrade considerations—knowledge typically acquired through years of consulting experience.</p><p>The company&#x27;s training methodology involves elite ServiceNow experts from consulting firms like <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/\"><u>Accenture</u></a> and specialized ServiceNow partner <a href=\"https://www.thirdera.com/\"><u>Thirdera</u></a>. This embedded expertise enables the AI to handle complex requirements and edge cases that typically require senior consultant intervention.</p><p>The real challenge isn&#x27;t teaching AI to write code — it&#x27;s capturing the intuitive expertise that separates junior developers from seasoned architects. Senior ServiceNow consultants instinctively know which customizations will break during upgrades and how simple requests spiral into complex integration problems. This institutional knowledge creates a far more defensible moat than general-purpose coding assistants can offer.</p><h2><b>The $1.5 trillion consulting market faces disruption</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s emergence reflects broader trends reshaping the enterprise software market. As companies accelerate digital transformation initiatives, the traditional consulting model increasingly appears inadequate for the speed and scale required.</p><p>ServiceNow itself has grown rapidly, reporting over <a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/now/revenue/\"><u>$10.98 billion in annual revenue in 2024</u></a>, and $12.06 billion for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, as organizations continue to digitize more business processes. However, this growth has created a persistent talent shortage, with demand for skilled ServiceNow professionals — particularly those with AI expertise — significantly outpacing supply.</p><p>The startup&#x27;s approach could fundamentally alter the economics of enterprise software implementation. Traditional consulting engagements often involve large teams working for months, with costs scaling linearly with project complexity. AI agents, by contrast, can handle multiple projects simultaneously and apply learned knowledge across customers.</p><p>Rak Garg, the Bain Capital Ventures partner who led Echelon&#x27;s funding round, sees this as part of a larger shift toward AI-powered professional services. &quot;We see the same trend with other BCV companies like <a href=\"https://www.prophetsecurity.ai/\"><u>Prophet Security</u></a>, which automates security operations, and <a href=\"https://baincapitalventures.com/insight/crosby-is-redefining-legal-work-with-ai-powered-contract-automation/\"><u>Crosby</u></a>, which automates legal services for startups. AI is quickly becoming the delivery layer across multiple functions.&quot;</p><h2><b>Scaling beyond ServiceNow while maintaining enterprise reliability</b></h2><p>Despite early success, Echelon faces significant challenges in scaling its approach. Enterprise customers prioritize reliability above speed, and any AI-generated configurations must meet strict security and compliance requirements.</p><p>&quot;Inertia is the biggest risk,&quot; Garg acknowledged. &quot;IT systems shouldn&#x27;t ever go down, and companies lose thousands of man-hours of productivity with every outage. Proving reliability at scale, and building on repeatable results will be critical for Echelon.&quot;</p><p>The company plans to expand beyond ServiceNow to other enterprise platforms including <a href=\"https://www.sap.com/index.html\"><u>SAP</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/\"><u>Salesforce</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.workday.com/en-us/homepage.html\"><u>Workday</u></a> — each creating substantial additional market opportunities. However, each platform requires developing new domain expertise and training models on platform-specific best practices.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/\"><u>Echelon</u></a> also faces potential competition from established consulting firms that are developing their own AI capabilities. However, Garg views these firms as potential partners rather than competitors, noting that many have already approached Echelon about collaboration opportunities.</p><p>&quot;They know that AI is shifting their business model in real-time,&quot; he said. &quot;Customers are placing immense pricing pressure on larger firms and asking hard questions, and these firms can use Echelon agents to accelerate their projects.&quot;</p><h2><b>How AI agents could reshape all professional services</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s funding and emergence from stealth marks a significant milestone in the application of AI to professional services. Unlike consumer AI applications that primarily enhance individual productivity, enterprise AI agents like Echelon&#x27;s directly replace skilled labor at scale.</p><p>The company&#x27;s approach — training AI systems on expert knowledge rather than just technical documentation — could serve as a model for automating other complex professional services. Legal research, financial analysis, and technical consulting all involve similar patterns of applying specialized expertise to unique customer requirements.</p><p>For enterprise customers, the promise extends beyond cost savings to strategic agility. Organizations that can rapidly implement and modify business processes gain competitive advantages in markets where customer expectations and regulatory requirements change frequently.</p><p>As Kayala noted, &quot;This unlocks a completely different approach to business agility and competitive advantage.&quot;</p><p>The implications extend far beyond ServiceNow implementations. If AI agents can master the intricacies of enterprise software deployment—one of the most complex and relationship-dependent areas of professional services — few knowledge work domains may remain immune to automation.</p><p>The question isn&#x27;t whether AI will transform professional services, but how quickly human expertise can be converted into autonomous digital workers that never sleep, never leave for competitors, and get smarter with every project they complete.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Software</category>\n            <category>Enterprise</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/6Wx0cy48ounMBeal2k0YPo/61ea707f3d72649cd7670e2cc4e809b6/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_AI_robot_coding_9f59b4e8-0719-4d4f-8bf3-025933b4c3f3.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n    </channel>\n</rss>"

This parallel release strategy reflects the company&#8217;s bet on multiple technological approaches rather than a single architectural paradigm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diffusion language models represent a departure from the autoregressive systems that underpin widely used chatbots like ChatGPT. Unlike sequential text generation, diffusion models produce outputs in parallel—an approach already prevalent in image and video generation tools but less common in language processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ant Group&#8217;s performance metrics for dInfer suggest substantial efficiency gains. Testing on the company&#8217;s LLaDA-MoE diffusion model yielded 1,011 tokens per second on the HumanEval coding benchmark, versus 91 tokens per second for Nvidia&#8217;s Fast-dLLM framework and 294 for Alibaba&#8217;s Qwen-2.5-3B model running on vLLM infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We believe that dInfer provides both a practical toolkit and a standardised platform to accelerate research and development in the rapidly growing field of dLLMs,&#8221; researchers at Ant Group noted in accompanying technical documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ecosystem-expansion-beyond-language-models\">Ecosystem expansion beyond language models</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ling-1T trillion-parameter AI model sits within a broader family of AI systems that Ant Group has assembled over recent months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ant_Ling_AI_Model_Family-1024x662.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109903\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ant_Ling_AI_Model_Family-1024x662.jpg 1024w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ant_Ling_AI_Model_Family-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ant_Ling_AI_Model_Family-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ant_Ling_AI_Model_Family-1536x993.jpg 1536w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ant_Ling_AI_Model_Family-2048x1324.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The company&#8217;s portfolio now spans three primary series: the Ling non-thinking models for standard language tasks, Ring thinking models designed for complex reasoning (including the previously released Ring-1T-preview), and Ming multimodal models capable of processing images, text, audio, and video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This diversified approach extends to an experimental model designated LLaDA-MoE, which employs Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture—a technique that activates only relevant portions of a large model for specific tasks, theoretically improving efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He Zhengyu, chief technology officer at Ant Group, articulated the company&#8217;s positioning around these releases. &#8220;At Ant Group, we believe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) should be a public good—a shared milestone for humanity&#8217;s intelligent future,&#8221; He stated, adding that the open-source releases of both the trillion-parameter AI model and Ring-1T-preview represent steps toward &#8220;open and collaborative advancement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-competitive-dynamics-in-a-constrained-environment\">Competitive dynamics in a constrained environment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing and nature of Ant Group&#8217;s releases illuminate strategic calculations within China&#8217;s AI sector. With access to cutting-edge semiconductor technology limited by export restrictions, Chinese technology firms have increasingly emphasised algorithmic innovation and software optimisation as competitive differentiators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ByteDance, parent company of TikTok, similarly introduced a diffusion language model called Seed Diffusion Preview in July, claiming five-fold speed improvements over comparable autoregressive architectures. These parallel efforts suggest industry-wide interest in alternative model paradigms that might offer efficiency advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the practical adoption trajectory for diffusion language models remains uncertain. Autoregressive systems continue dominating commercial deployments due to proven performance in natural language understanding and generation—the core requirements for customer-facing applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-open-source-strategy-as-market-positioning\">Open-source strategy as market positioning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By making the trillion-parameter AI model publicly available alongside the dInfer framework, Ant Group is pursuing a collaborative development model that contrasts with the closed approaches of some competitors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This strategy potentially accelerates innovation while positioning Ant&#8217;s technologies as foundational infrastructure for the broader AI community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is simultaneously developing AWorld, a framework intended to support continual learning in autonomous AI agents—systems designed to complete tasks independently on behalf of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether these combined efforts can establish Ant Group as a significant force in global AI development depends partly on real-world validation of the performance claims and partly on adoption rates among developers seeking alternatives to established platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trillion-parameter AI model&#8217;s open-source nature may facilitate this validation process while building a community of users invested in the technology&#8217;s success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the releases demonstrate that major Chinese technology firms view the current AI landscape as fluid enough to accommodate new entrants willing to innovate across multiple dimensions simultaneously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ant-group-uses-domestic-chips-to-train-ai-models-and-cut-costs/\">Ant Group uses domestic chips to train AI models and cut costs</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

That wait period is often filled with worry and it always feels like an eternity. But what if that wait could be cut from weeks down to just a few minutes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next phase of its <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/mhra-pilots-ai-airlock-accelerate-healthcare-adoption/\">‘AI Airlock’</a> programme, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is evaluating seven new technologies designed to tackle some of healthcare&#8217;s most pressing challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The innovations being trialled could slash the time for bowel cancer test results to mere minutes and enable earlier detection of skin cancer and genetic eye diseases. The AI Airlock initiative provides a secure, controlled environment for manufacturers to test these sophisticated systems. This &#8220;regulatory sandbox&#8221; allows for evaluation of the AI&#8217;s effectiveness and limitations, helping to forge a clear path towards eventual regulatory approval and deployment within the health service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The insights gained from this real-world testing will directly inform the MHRA&#8217;s future regulations for AI as a medical device and feed into the National Commission into the Regulation of AI in Healthcare. This commission brings together a diverse group of patient advocates, clinicians, regulators, and technology companies to advise the agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seven selected technologies include AI-powered clinical note-taking to reduce administrative burdens on doctors, advanced cancer diagnostics, sophisticated eye disease detection, and tools that can summarise a patient&#8217;s entire hospital stay or interpret complex blood tests. The ultimate goal is to use AI to support clinicians, helping them to make faster and better-informed care decisions for their patients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Health Innovation Minister Zubir Ahmed said: “The AI airlock programme is a great example of how we can test new innovations thoroughly while still moving at pace, as we seek to deliver on our promise to shift healthcare from analogue to digital.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Through our ten year health plan we will drive for the NHS to be the most AI-enabled healthcare system in the world.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pioneering-a-path-for-safe-ai-healthcare-innovation\">Pioneering a path for safe AI healthcare innovation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The evolution of AI presents unique challenges for regulators tasked with ensuring patient care safety.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lawrence Tallon, MHRA Chief Executive, commented: “As the first country to create a dedicated regulatory environment, or ‘sandbox’, specifically for AI medical devices, we’re pioneering solutions to the unique challenges of regulating these emerging healthcare technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first phase of AI Airlock demonstrated the value of close collaboration between innovators and regulators. I look forward to seeing the results of this new cohort and how their technologies will shape the next generation of safe, effective AI tools in healthcare.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This second phase builds upon the success of the initial pilot. The MHRA has published four reports detailing the key findings from the first group of participants, which included innovative companies like Philips and OncoFlow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with the initial cohort, the AI Airlock programme identified several areas for regulatory improvement. These included better methods for validating synthetic data used to train AI models, ensuring the decisions made by an AI are &#8220;explainable&#8221; to a clinician, and developing novel approaches to tackle emerging risks such as AI &#8220;hallucinations,&#8221; where a model generates incorrect or nonsensical information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yinnon Dolev, Gen AI Product Owner at <a href=\"https://www.philips.co.uk/healthcare\">Philips Medical Systems</a>, said: “Participating in the AI Airlock sandbox was a very positive experience. The chance for a R&amp;D representative to impact the regulatory strategy with the regulator is almost unheard of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The interaction with the team and experts was exceptional. They provided invaluable insights and support, making the entire process smooth and productive. Meeting with the MHRA on a weekly basis throughout the pilot was also a catalyst for meaningful progress expediting our development activities.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-clinician-s-perspective-of-using-ai-tools-for-patient-care\">A clinician&#8217;s perspective of using AI tools for patient care</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For frontline medical staff, the promise of AI is coupled with a healthy dose of caution. Sir Andrew Goddard, Chairman of the AI Airlock Governance Board and a Consultant Gastroenterologist at <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/services/hospital/royal-derby-hospital/RTGFG\">Royal Derby Hospital</a>, emphasised the programme&#8217;s role in building trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Many clinicians, like myself, are keen to see AI find its place in the NHS, but are worried by over-promise on results and lack of reassurance with regards to patient safety,” explained Sir Goddard. “This programme goes a long way to embedding safety and rapid development of these new technologies in our health service.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By bringing innovators and regulators together at an early stage, the AI Airlock will help to deliver the next wave of medical technology to improve patient care, but in a manner that is also safe, reliable, and worthy of the trust of both patients and doctors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/nvidia-gpus-power-oracle-next-gen-enterprise-ai-services/\"><strong>NVIDIA GPUs to power Oracle’s next-gen enterprise AI services</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

This platform is accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs and engineered for the kind of AI training and inference workloads that would make a normal server weep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OCI Zettascale10 promises a mighty 16 zettaflops of peak AI compute performance and is knitted together with NVIDIA&#8217;s Spectrum-X Ethernet, a networking fabric designed specifically to stop GPUs from sitting around waiting for data, allowing organisations to scale up to millions of processors efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But raw power is only half the story. The real substance of this partnership lies in the software integrations that aim to weave AI into every layer of a business&#8217;s operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mahesh Thiagarajan, Executive VP of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, commented: “OCI Zettascale10 delivers multi‑gigawatt capacity for the most challenging AI workloads with NVIDIA’s next-generation GPU platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In addition, the native availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise on OCI gives our joint customers a leading AI toolset close at hand to OCI’s 200+ cloud services, supporting a long tail of customer innovation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-giving-your-oracle-database-a-brain-with-ai\">Giving your Oracle database a brain with AI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundation of this new strategy is the Oracle AI Database 26ai. For years, the conventional wisdom was to move your data to where the AI models are. Oracle is flipping that on its head, arguing that it’s far more secure and efficient to bring the AI to your data. This latest database release is the embodiment of that &#8220;AI for Data&#8221; vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan Loaiza, Executive VP of Oracle Database Technologies at Oracle, said: “By architecting AI and data together, Oracle AI Database makes ‘AI for Data’ simple to learn and simple to use. We enable our customers to easily deliver trusted AI insights, innovations, and productivity for all their data, everywhere, including both operational systems and analytic data lakes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the standout features is the ability to run agentic AI workflows inside your database. The AI agents can tackle complex questions by combining your enterprise&#8217;s private, sensitive data with public information, all without ever having to move that private data outside your secure environment. This is made possible by features like a Unified Hybrid Vector Search, which lets the AI look for context across all your data types, whether it&#8217;s in a relational table, a JSON file, or a spatial map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oracle is also clearly thinking about the long game with security. The new database implements NIST-approved quantum-resistant algorithms for data both in-flight and at-rest. It’s a defence against &#8220;harvest now, decrypt later&#8221; attacks, where hackers steal encrypted data today with the hope of breaking it with future quantum computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Holger Mueller, VP and Principal Analyst at <a href=\"https://www.constellationr.com/\">Constellation Research</a>, commented: “Great AI needs great data. With Oracle AI Database 26ai, customers get both. It’s the single place where their business data lives—current, consistent, and secure. And it’s the best place to use AI on that data without moving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“To help simplify and accelerate AI adoption, AI Database 26ai includes impressive new AI features that go beyond AI Vector Search. A highlight is Oracle’s architecting agentic AI into the database, enabling customers to build, deploy, and manage their own in-database AI agents using a no-code visual platform that includes pre-built agents.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new database is designed to work with NVIDIA&#8217;s toolset. Its programming interfaces can now plug directly into NVIDIA NeMo Retriever, a collection of microservices that handle the complicated plumbing of modern AI for an enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes it far easier for developers to implement things like retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. In simple terms, RAG allows a language model to look up relevant facts in your company documents before it answers a question, making its responses far more accurate and useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Oracle Private AI Services Container will also get a GPU-powered boost. This container lets businesses run AI models in their own secure environment. Soon, it will be able to offload the heavy lifting of creating vector embeddings – a core task for AI search – to powerful NVIDIA GPUs using the cuVS library. This promises to slash the time it takes to prepare data for AI applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-democratising-enterprise-ai\">Democratising enterprise AI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the database, the partnership aims to simplify the entire AI pipeline. The new Oracle AI Data Platform now includes a built-in NVIDIA GPU option and the NVIDIA RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark. For data scientists and engineers, this is a big deal. It means they can speed up their data processing and machine learning workflows using GPUs, often without having to change a single line of their existing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these tools and capabilities are being consolidated within the Oracle AI Hub. The idea is to give organisations a single place to build, deploy, and manage their AI solutions. From the hub, users can deploy NVIDIA&#8217;s NIM microservices – which are like pre-packaged AI skills – through a simple, no-code interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To lower the barrier to entry even further, the full NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite is now natively available within the OCI Console. This means that a developer can spin up a GPU instance and enable all the necessary NVIDIA tools with a few clicks, rather than going through a separate procurement process. It’s a small change that makes a big difference in how quickly teams can get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s clear that this collaboration is aimed at solving the real-world challenges businesses face when trying to adopt AI. By bringing the hardware, the data, and the software tools into one cohesive ecosystem, Oracle and NVIDIA are making a case that the era of practical, secure, and scalable enterprise AI has well and truly arrived.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/cisco-only-13-percent-solid-ai-strategy-and-lapping-rivals/\"><strong>Cisco: Only 13% have a solid AI strategy and they’re lapping rivals</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The question for enterprises becomes: how do you build infrastructure and platforms capable of supporting this level of autonomous operation?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">What do tomatoes and cement have in common?

According to the&nbsp;company&#8217;s&nbsp;technical specifications, this approach boosts single-PU inference speed 4-5 times compared to other popular models.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also incorporates memory-centric AI-Native Storage designed for typical AI tasks, aimed at enhancing both training and inference efficiency. ModelBest, a company specialising in general-purpose AI and device intelligence, demonstrated practical applications of this infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Li Dahai, co-founder and CEO of ModelBest, detailed how their MiniCPM series—spanning foundation models, multi-modal capabilities, and full-modality integration—integrates with Huawei Cloud AI Compute Service to achieve 20% improvements in training energy efficiency and 10% performance gains over industry standards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The MiniCPM models have found applications in automotive systems, smartphones, embodied AI, and AI-enabled personal computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-from-foundation-models-to-industry-specific-applications\">From foundation models to industry-specific applications</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge of adapting foundation models for specific industry needs has driven the development of more sophisticated training methodologies.&nbsp;Huawei&nbsp;Cloud&#8217;s&nbsp;approach encompasses three key components: a&nbsp;complete&nbsp;data pipeline&nbsp;handling&nbsp;collection through management, a ready-to-use incremental training workflow, and&nbsp;a smart&nbsp;evaluation platform with preset evaluation sets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The incremental training workflow reportedly boosts model performance by 20-30% through automatic adjustment of data and training settings based on core model features and industry-specific objectives. The evaluation platform enables quick setup of systems aligned with industry or company benchmarks, addressing both accuracy and speed requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real-world implementations illustrate the practical application of these methodologies. Shaanxi Cultural Industry Investment Group partnered with Huawei to integrate AI with cultural tourism operations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huang Yong, Chairman of Shaanxi Cultural Industry Investment Group, explained that using Huawei&nbsp;Cloud&#8217;s&nbsp;data-AI convergence platform, the organisation combined diverse cultural tourism data to create comprehensive datasets spanning history, film, and intangible heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The partnership established what&nbsp;they term&nbsp;a&nbsp;&#8220;trusted national data space for cultural tourism&#8221;&nbsp;on Huawei Cloud, enabling applications&nbsp;including&nbsp;asset verification, copyright&nbsp;transaction, enterprise credit enhancement, and creative development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration&nbsp;produced&nbsp;the Boguan cultural tourism model, which powers AI-driven tools, including a cultural tourism intelligent brain, smart management assistant, intelligent travel assistant, and an&nbsp;AI&nbsp;short video platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>International implementations demonstrate similar patterns. Dubai Municipality worked with Huawei Cloud to integrate foundation models, virtual humans, digital twins, and geographical information systems into urban systems.&nbsp;Mariam Almheiri, CEO of the Building Regulation and Permits Agency at Dubai Municipality,&nbsp;shared&nbsp;how this integration has&nbsp;improved&nbsp;city planning, facility management, and emergency&nbsp;responses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-enterprise-grade-agent-platforms-emerge\">Enterprise-grade agent platforms emerge</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The distinction between consumer-focused AI agents and enterprise-grade agentic AI systems centres on integration requirements and operational complexity. Enterprise systems must seamlessly integrate into broader workflows, handle complex situations, and meet higher operational standards than consumer applications&nbsp;designed&nbsp;for quick interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huawei&nbsp;Cloud&#8217;s&nbsp;Versatile platform addresses this gap by providing infrastructure for businesses to create agents tailored to production needs. The platform combines AI compute, models, data platforms, tools, and ecosystem capabilities to streamline agent development through deployment, release, usage, and management phases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conch&nbsp;Group&#8217;s&nbsp;implementation in cement manufacturing offers specific performance metrics.&nbsp;The company partnered with Huawei to create what&nbsp;they describe&nbsp;as the cement&nbsp;industry&#8217;s&nbsp;first AI-powered cement and building materials&nbsp;model.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resulting cement agents&nbsp;predict&nbsp;clinker strength at 3 and 28 days&nbsp;with&nbsp;predictions deviating&nbsp;less&nbsp;than 1 MPa from actual results, representing over 90% accuracy.&nbsp;For cement calcination optimisation, the model suggests key process parameters and operational solutions that cut standard coal usage by 1% compared to class A energy efficiency standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Xu Yue, Assistant to Conch&nbsp;Cement&#8217;s&nbsp;General Manager, noted that the&nbsp;model&#8217;s&nbsp;success with quality control, production optimisation, equipment management, and safety establishes groundwork for end-to-end collaboration and decision-making through cement agents, moving the industry&nbsp;&#8220;from relying on traditional expertise to being fully driven by data across all processes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In corporate travel management, Smartcom developed a travel agent using Huawei Cloud Versatile that provides end-to-end&nbsp;smart&nbsp;services across departure, transfers, and flights. Kong Xianghong, CTO of Shenzhen Smartcom and Director of Smartcom Solutions, reported that the system combines travel industry data, company policies, and individual trip histories to generate recommendations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees adopt over half of these suggestions and complete bookings in under two minutes. The agent resolves 80% of issues in an average of three interactions through predictive question matching.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-s-nbsp-next-for-autonomous-ai\">What’s&nbsp;next for autonomous AI?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementations discussed at the summit reflect a broader industry trend toward agentic AI systems that operate with increasing autonomy within defined parameters.&nbsp;The&nbsp;technology&#8217;s&nbsp;progression from reactive tools to systems capable of planning and executing complex tasks independently represents a fundamental&nbsp;architectural&nbsp;shift in enterprise computing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the transition requires substantial infrastructure investments, sophisticated data engineering, and careful integration with existing business processes. The performance metrics from early implementations—whether in manufacturing efficiency gains, urban management improvements, or travel booking optimisation—provide benchmarks for organisations evaluating similar deployments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As agentic AI systems continue to mature, the focus appears to be shifting from&nbsp;technological capability demonstrationsto operational integration challenges, governance frameworks, and measurable business outcomes.&nbsp;The examples from cement manufacturing, cultural tourism, and corporate travel management suggest that practical value emerges when these systems address specific operational pain points rather than serving as general-purpose automation tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by AI News )</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/huawei-open-source-ai-development-platform-technical-specs/\">Huawei details open-source AI development roadmap at Huawei Connect 2025</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109873\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out<a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

It turns out that just 13 percent globally are actually prepared for the AI revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this small group – which Cisco calls the &#8216;Pacesetters&#8217; – are lapping the competition. The third annual Cisco AI Readiness Index found these top performers are four times more likely to get their AI projects out of the pilot stage and into the real world. More importantly, they are 50 percent more likely to see measurable value from their efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What they&#8217;ve figured out is that winning with AI is about getting the foundations right with a disciplined approach that weaves together strategy, infrastructure, and security. And it pays off, with 90 percent of these Pacesetters seeing real gains in profit, productivity, and innovation, while most of their peers are hovering around the 60 percent mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeetu Patel, Cisco’s President and Chief Product Officer, said: “This year’s Cisco AI Readiness Index makes one thing clear: AI doesn’t fail, readiness fails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The most AI-ready organisations – the Pacesetters from our research – prove it. They’re four times more likely to move pilots into production and 50 percent more likely to realise measurable value. So, with more than 80 percent of organisations we surveyed about to deploy AI agents, these new findings confirm readiness, discipline, and action are key to unlocking value.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what’s their secret? The research shows a clear pattern. Pacesetters don’t treat AI as a side project; it&#8217;s a core part of their business strategy. Almost every single one of them (99%) has a proper AI roadmap, something only 58 percent of other companies can claim. They also put their money where their mouth is. For 79 percent of them, AI is the top investment priority, a commitment shared by only 24 percent of the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These leaders are building for the long haul, with 98 percent designing their networks to handle the immense scale and complexity of AI, compared to just 46 percent of their peers. It gives them the confidence that their systems can handle whatever is thrown at them; 71 percent say their networks can scale instantly for any AI project, a feeling shared by a worryingly low 15 percent of other organisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also gives us a glimpse into the near future, and for many, it looks rocky. Two huge challenges are looming: the widespread use of AI agents and a problem Cisco has dubbed &#8216;AI Infrastructure Debt&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>83 percent of companies are planning to deploy AI agents as part of their strategy, with nearly 40 percent expecting them to be working alongside human employees within a year. But here’s the problem: most of these firms are trying to build on shaky ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over half of companies admitted their current networks simply can&#8217;t handle the data volumes or complexity that these advanced AI systems demand. The Pacesetters, on the other hand, have already done their homework, with 75 percent feeling fully equipped to secure and control these agents, compared to just 31 percent of others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This leads us to the ticking time bomb of ‘AI Infrastructure Debt’. Think of it as the modern version of the technical debt that plagued companies for years. It’s the result of all the compromises, postponed upgrades, and underfunded plans that quietly pile up, slowly strangling the long-term value of AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The warning signs are already flashing. Nearly two-thirds of leaders expect their workloads to jump by over 30 percent in the next three years, and a similar number are struggling just to get their data organised in one place. Add to that the fact that only a quarter have enough GPU power, and you see a massive gap between ambition and reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lesson from Cisco’s report is clear and simple: value follows readiness. In the race to adopt AI, the Pacesetters have shown that the organisations that take the time to build a strong foundation to support their strategy are the ones that will pull away from the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/gemini-enterprise-google-ai-agent-every-desk/\"><strong>Gemini Enterprise: Google aims to put an AI agent on every desk</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

The move underscores the company’s push to stay competitive as AI becomes central to enterprise software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded and headquartered in San Francisco since 1999, Salesforce has been adding AI features across its products, including the workplace messaging tool Slack. The company is competing with ServiceNow, Oracle, and Microsoft to attract organisations eager to integrate AI into their operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the new investment will fund an AI incubator on Salesforce’s San Francisco campus and help companies deploy AI agents — digital assistants that can handle tasks for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This $15 billion investment reflects our deep commitment to our hometown — advancing AI innovation, creating jobs and helping companies and our communities thrive,” said CEO Marc Benioff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The announcement comes just before Dreamforce, Salesforce’s annual conference, which runs from October 14 to 16 in San Francisco. The company expects around 50,000 people to attend and estimates the event will bring in about $130 million in local revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salesforce, which employs more than 76,000 people worldwide, also announced last week that it will spend $1 billion in Mexico over the next five years. The company has operated there since 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Morningstar analyst Dan Romanoff said the new spending aligns with the company’s long-term goals. “If the company wants to remain a leader in an important emerging technology area, it must have a pipeline of talent to innovate and drive the field forward. We already see shortages of AI talent, so this makes sense,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Salesforce shares rose 2.8% on Monday but remain down about 28% since the start of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the same day, Salesforce also launched Agentforce 360, a new AI platform for businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many companies are still experimenting with AI-driven automation, Salesforce says it has already rolled out multiple versions of its “agentic” technology, used by thousands of customers and within its own operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company describes the “Agentic Enterprise” as a workplace model where AI supports people rather than replaces them. In this setup, AI agents help teams respond faster, track leads, provide continuous service, and make better decisions. The goal, Salesforce says, is to boost productivity and customer engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agentforce 360 combines four key parts of this model:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Agentforce 360 Platform:</strong> A framework for building enterprise AI agents, now featuring a conversational builder, hybrid reasoning for more accurate results, and voice support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Data 360:</strong> A unified data layer that gives AI systems the context they need. Features like Intelligent Context and Tableau Semantics help turn raw data into meaningful insights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer 360 Apps:</strong> The tools that record how a company sells, serves, and operates — now enhanced with AI to better understand customer behaviour and internal processes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Slack:</strong> A shared space where people and AI agents can work together, linking information and actions in real time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Salesforce says this setup allows businesses to build AI agents that rely on trusted data, function across departments, and integrate directly with existing workflows. Its open ecosystem also lets partners tailor the technology for different industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, Salesforce forecast third-quarter revenue that fell short of analyst expectations but expanded its share buyback plan by $20 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@dnevozhai?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Denys Nevozhai</a>)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/salesforce-agentforce-3-brings-visibility-ai-agents/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Salesforce Agentforce 3 brings visibility to AI agents</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109873\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Both companies are adopting Spectrum-X as part of an open networking framework designed to improve AI training efficiency and accelerate deployment across massive compute clusters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s founder and CEO, said trillion-parameter models are transforming data centres into “giga-scale AI factories,” adding that Spectrum-X acts as the “nervous system” connecting millions of GPUs to train the largest models ever built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oracle plans to use Spectrum-X Ethernet with its Vera Rubin architecture to build large-scale AI factories. Mahesh Thiagarajan, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s executive vice president, said the new setup will allow the company to connect millions of GPUs more efficiently, helping customers train and deploy new AI models faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta, meanwhile, is expanding its AI infrastructure by integrating Spectrum Ethernet switches into the Facebook Open Switching System (FBOSS), its in-house platform for managing network switches at scale. According to Gaya Nagarajan, Meta’s vice president of networking engineering, the company’s next-generation network must be open and efficient to support ever-larger AI models and deliver services to billions of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-flexible-ai-systems\">Building flexible AI systems</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Joe DeLaere, who leads NVIDIA’s Accelerated Computing Solution Portfolio for Data Centre, flexibility is key as data centres grow more complex. He explained that NVIDIA’s MGX system offers a modular, building-block design that lets partners combine different CPUs, GPUs, storage, and networking components as needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also promotes interoperability, allowing organisations to use the same design across multiple generations of hardware. “It offers flexibility, faster time to market, and future readiness,” DeLaere said to the media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI models become larger, power efficiency has become a central challenge for data centres. DeLaere said NVIDIA is working “from chip to grid” to improve energy use and scalability, collaborating closely with power and cooling vendors to maximise performance per watt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One example is the shift to 800-volt DC power delivery, which reduces heat loss and improves efficiency. The company is also introducing power-smoothing technology to reduce spikes on the electrical grid — an approach that can cut maximum power needs by up to 30 per cent, allowing more compute capacity within the same footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-scaling-up-out-and-across\">Scaling up, out, and across</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>NVIDIA’s MGX system also plays a role in how data centres are scaled. Gilad Shainer, the company’s senior vice president of networking, told the media that MGX racks host both compute and switching components, supporting NVLink for scale-up connectivity and Spectrum-X Ethernet for scale-out growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that MGX can connect multiple AI data centres together as a unified system — what companies like Meta need to support massive distributed AI training operations. Depending on distance, they can link sites through dark fibre or additional MGX-based switches, enabling high-speed connections across regions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meta’s AI adoption of Spectrum-X reflects the growing importance of open networking. Shainer said the company will use FBOSS as its network operating system but noted that Spectrum-X supports several others, including Cumulus, SONiC, and Cisco’s NOS through partnerships. This flexibility allows hyperscalers and enterprises to standardise their infrastructure using the systems that best fit their environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-expanding-the-ai-ecosystem\">Expanding the AI ecosystem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>NVIDIA sees Spectrum-X as a way to make AI infrastructure more efficient and accessible across different scales. Shainer said the Ethernet platform was designed specifically for AI workloads like training and inference, offering up to 95 percent effective bandwidth and outperforming traditional Ethernet by a wide margin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that NVIDIA’s partnerships with companies such as Cisco, xAI, Meta, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are helping to bring Spectrum-X to a broader range of environments — from hyperscalers to enterprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-preparing-for-vera-rubin-and-beyond\">Preparing for Vera Rubin and beyond</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DeLaere said NVIDIA’s upcoming Vera Rubin architecture is expected to be commercially available in the second half of 2026, with the Rubin CPX product arriving by year’s end. Both will work alongside Spectrum-X networking and MGX systems to support the next generation of AI factories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also clarified that Spectrum-X and XGS share the same core hardware but use different algorithms for varying distances — Spectrum-X for inside data centres and XGS for inter–data centre communication. This approach minimises latency and allows multiple sites to operate together as a single large AI supercomputer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-collaborating-across-the-power-chain\">Collaborating across the power chain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To support the 800-volt DC transition, NVIDIA is working with partners from chip level to grid. The company is collaborating with Onsemi and Infineon on power components, with Delta, Flex, and Lite-On at the rack level, and with Schneider Electric and Siemens on data centre designs. A technical white paper detailing this approach will be released at the OCP Summit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeLaere described this as a “holistic design from silicon to power delivery,” ensuring all systems work seamlessly together in high-density AI environments that companies like Meta and Oracle operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-performance-advantages-for-hyperscalers\">Performance advantages for hyperscalers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Spectrum-X Ethernet was built specifically for distributed computing and AI workloads. Shainer said it offers adaptive routing and telemetry-based congestion control to eliminate network hotspots and deliver stable performance. These features enable higher training and inference speeds while allowing multiple workloads to run simultaneously without interference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added that Spectrum-X is the only Ethernet technology proven to scale at extreme levels, helping organisations get the best performance and return on their GPU investments. For hyperscalers such as Meta, that scalability helps manage growing AI training demands and keep infrastructure efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-hardware-and-software-working-together\">Hardware and software working together</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While NVIDIA’s focus is often on hardware, DeLaere said software optimisation is equally important. The company continues to improve performance through co-design — aligning hardware and software development to maximise efficiency for AI systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NVIDIA is investing in FP4 kernels, frameworks such as Dynamo and TensorRT-LLM, and algorithms like speculative decoding to improve throughput and AI model performance. These updates, he said, ensure that systems like Blackwell continue to deliver better results over time for hyperscalers such as Meta that rely on consistent AI performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-networking-for-the-trillion-parameter-era\">Networking for the trillion-parameter era</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spectrum-X platform — which includes Ethernet switches and SuperNICs — is NVIDIA’s first Ethernet system purpose-built for AI workloads. It’s designed to link millions of GPUs efficiently while maintaining predictable performance across AI data centres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With congestion-control technology achieving up to 95 per cent data throughput, Spectrum-X marks a major leap over standard Ethernet, which typically reaches only about 60 per cent due to flow collisions. Its XGS technology also supports long-distance AI data centre links, connecting facilities across regions into unified “AI super factories.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tying together NVIDIA’s full stack — GPUs, CPUs, NVLink, and software — Spectrum-X provides the consistent performance needed to support trillion-parameter models and the next wave of generative AI workloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by Nvidia)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/openai-and-nvidia-plan-100-b-chip-deal-for-ai-future/\">OpenAI and Nvidia plan $100B chip deal for AI future</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109849\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Instead of manual data-wrestling and business users spending hours uncovering insights hidden deep in datasets, they get results fast — in text, graphics, summaries, and, where needed, detailed breakdowns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast and accurate data analysis is important to every organisation, but for many, real-time insights are crucial. In the agricultural sector, for example,<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fabi.ai/customers/lumo\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Lumo</a> uses Fabi.ai’s platform to manage large fleets of IoT devices, collecting telemetry data continuously and adjusting its systems based on collated, normalised, and parsed information.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using vibe analysis, Lumo sees device performance immediately, as well as trends that develop over time. It pulls in weather data, and correlates the device fleet’s performance metrics with environmental factors. The data dashboards Lumo has built are not the result of many months of work writing data integration routines and front-end coding, but are a result of vibe analysis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-getting-under-the-hood\">Getting under the hood </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sceptics of AI’s abilities often point to vibe-coding as an example of where things can go wrong, raising concerns about quality control and the “black box” nature of AI-driven analysis. Many users want visibility into how results are generated, with the option to inspect logic, tweak queries, or adjust API calls to ensure accuracy. When done well, vibe analytics addresses these concerns by combining transparency with rigour. Natural language inputs and modular build methods make it accessible to semitechnical users (such as founders and product leaders), while the underlying systems meet the accuracy and reliability standards expected by technical teams. This means users can trust the output whether they’re working independently or in collaboration with data scientists and developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed specifically for both data experts and semitechnical data users, Fabi is a generative BI platform that brings vibe analysis done right to life. The code it produces can be hidden away entirely, or shown verbatim and edited in place, giving semitechnical users a chance to understand how the analysis works under the hood, while allowing technical teams to verify and fine-tune the system’s output. Data flows from an organisation’s systems (the platform mediates connections) or is uploaded. The resultant actionable insights can be pushed/scheduled to email, slack, google sheets, displayed in graphics, text, or a mixture of both.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-fabi-a-generative-bi-platform\">Fabi: A generative BI platform</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-founder and CEO of Fabi, Marc Dupuis, describes how many organisations start using the analysis platform by testing workflows and queries on sample data before progressing to real-world analysis. As users delve into data troves and test their work, they can check its veracity, often in collaboration with someone more technically astute, thanks to the platform’s open, transparent view of Smartbooks to show what’s happening under the hood. It works the other way, too: semitechnical data users can confirm that the data being processed is relevant and accurate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address common concerns about quality control and “black-box” AI, Fabi limits vibe analysis to internally controlled, carefully accessed data sources, with built-in guardrails. Code can be shown verbatim and edited in place, giving semitechnical users visibility into how results are produced, while allowing technical teams to audit, verify, and fine-tune outputs. Collaborative sharing of reports, findings, and working code helps teams validate results without working outside their areas of expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typical workflows include real-time KPI dashboards; natural-language Q&amp;A over operational and product data; correlation analyses (for example, device performance against weather conditions); cohort and trend exploration; A/B test readouts and experiment summaries; and scheduled, shareable reports that mix text, graphics, summaries, and detailed breakdowns. These collaborative workflows are designed to be efficient and intuitive, so, whether working collectively or solo, users can unlock insights from even the most complex data arrangements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fabi landed its first round of backing from Eniac Ventures in 2023, so it’s a company on the move. The team continues to expand its capabilities, with plans to make <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fabi.ai/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">vibe analysis</a> even more seamless for both semitechnical and technical users. Organisations interested in exploring the platform can start by testing workflows on sample data, then scale up to real-world use cases as they grow more confident in the system’s transparency and accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@alinnnaaaa?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Alina Grubnyak</a>)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/generative-ai-trends-2025-llms-data-scaling-enterprise-adoption/\">Generative AI trends 2025: LLMs, data scaling &amp; enterprise adoption</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109843\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

It aims to democratise the creation and use of AI-powered agents for automating complex workflows and boosting productivity across entire organisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, introduced the new offering, explaining that as customers moved beyond simply building applications with AI, the company saw them &#8220;advancing to build agents&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemini Enterprise is Google&#8217;s answer to this evolution, bundling its entire AI stack into a cohesive user experience that allows developers and business users alike to build agents with a no-code workbench.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform is built on six core components. The &#8220;brains&#8221; are Google&#8217;s powerful Gemini models, including the newly available Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. The “workbench&#8221; is the agent creation and orchestration technology pioneered with Agentspace, allowing any user to manage agents and automate processes. Finally, this is complemented by the “taskforce,&#8221; a suite of pre-built Google agents for specialised jobs like the new Code Assist Agent and the Deep Research Agent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make these agents effective, there is deep integration with a company&#8217;s data through new connectors for systems like Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Box, Confluence, and Jira. Kurian explained the system&#8217;s intelligence, stating, &#8220;We remember who you are and what you do and use it to personalise the context you have when we work with a large language model&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A central &#8220;governance&#8221; framework allows organisations to monitor, secure, and audit all agents from one place, with protections like Model Armor now built-in. Finally, the platform is built on an open &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; of over 100,000 partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gemini-enterprise-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-work\">Gemini Enterprise: A glimpse into the future of work</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To demonstrate the platform&#8217;s capabilities, Maryam Gholami walked through a practical use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The beauty of Gemini Enterprise is that it offers the familiar interface of the Gemini but built for enterprise workflows, including full control to enable or disable any of the sources as needed,&#8221; Gholami said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a custom &#8216;campaigns agent&#8217;, she used four different agents to handle market research, media generation, team communications, and inventory management. The agent identified a market trend towards sci-fi themes, flagged a 25 percent inventory gap, created a purchase order in ServiceNow, drafted an email to store managers, and generated social media assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gemini Enterprise is more than just a chat interface,&#8221; Gholami concluded after the demonstration. &#8220;It&#8217;s an end-to-end AI system that unifies your data, your tools, and your teams, turning weeks of complex work into a single, streamlined conversation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-cloud-gemini-enterprise-marketing.gif\" alt=\"Example of an AI agent for marketing using Google Cloud Gemini Enterprise.\" class=\"wp-image-109827\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customers-drive-transformation-with-ai-fleets\">Customers drive transformation with AI fleets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Proving the platform&#8217;s real-world value, Nirmal Saverimuttu, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.virginvoyages.com/\">Virgin Voyages</a>, shared his perspective that &#8220;any major disruption like AI requires a cultural transformation to be successful&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, Saverimuttu stressed that AI&#8217;s role is to work alongside, not replace, his team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our people are our biggest asset. AI. And never replace our people,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;To me, AI is about getting the best from our people. It&#8217;s about unleashing human potential&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cruise line has deployed a fleet of over 50 specialised AI agents company-wide. The first, &#8216;Email Ellie&#8217;, has boosted content production speed by 40 percent and contributed to a 28 percent year-over-year increase in July sales. Saverimuttu also noted welcome operational gains, including a &#8220;35 percent reduction in agency dependency costs, resulting in creative independence&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another early adopter is <a href=\"https://www.macquarie.com.au/\">Macquarie Bank</a>. The bank, one of Australia&#8217;s largest, has rolled out Gemini Enterprise to every employee and reports that 99 percent of its staff have already completed generative AI training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google emphasised that Gemini Enterprise is an open platform, with partners like Box, Salesforce, and ServiceNow announcing compatible agents. A new AI agent finder will also help customers discover thousands of validated partner solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Gordon Food Service empowers every employee with Gemini Enterprise\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEkyJaFmQ6o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To support adoption, Google has also launched Google Skills, a new free learning platform with 3,000 courses. As part of this, the company announced the Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR) program; an educational sprint designed to enable one million developers to build and deploy agents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pricing-and-availability-of-gemini-enterprise\">Pricing and availability of Gemini Enterprise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemini Enterprise is available globally in all countries where Google Cloud products are sold. Gemini Business, for small businesses, starts at $21 per seat per month, while Gemini Enterprise Standard and Plus editions for larger organisations start at $30 per seat per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Kurian, the launch is about democratising powerful technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gemini Enterprise technology is really about reimagining a super powerful AI technology [for the workplace] but making it super easy to use and putting it in the hands of every company and every user in those companies,&#8221; Kurian concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-value-remains-elusive-despite-soaring-investment/\"><strong>AI value remains elusive despite soaring investment</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Broadcom fired the first salvo in mid-August with its &#8220;Jericho 4&#8221; StrataDNX switch/router chips, which began sampling and also offered 51.2 Tb/sec of aggregate bandwidth backed by HBM memory for deep packet buffering to manage congestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks after Broadcom&#8217;s announcement, Nvidia unveiled its <a href=\"http://What happens when AI data centres run out of space? NVIDIA’s new solution explained\">Spectrum-XGS scale-across network</a>—a notably cheeky name given that Broadcom&#8217;s &#8220;Trident&#8221; and &#8220;Tomahawk&#8221; switch ASICs belong to the StrataXGS family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia secured CoreWeave as its anchor customer but provided limited technical details about the Spectrum-XGS ASICs. Now Cisco is rolling out its own components for the scale-across networking market, setting up a three-way competition among networking heavyweights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-problem-ai-is-too-big-for-one-building\">The problem: AI is too big for one building</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand why multiple vendors are rushing into this space, consider the scale of modern AI infrastructure. Training large language models or running complex AI systems requires thousands of high-powered processors working in concert, generating enormous amounts of heat and consuming massive amounts of electricity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data centres are hitting hard limits—not just on available space, but on&nbsp;how much&nbsp;power they can supply and cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data centre, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centres hundreds of miles apart,&#8221; said Martin Lund, Executive Vice President of Cisco&#8217;s Common Hardware Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The industry has traditionally addressed capacity challenges through two approaches: scaling up (adding more capability to individual systems) or scaling out (connecting more systems within the same facility).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But both strategies are reaching their limits. Data centres are running out of physical space, power grids can&#8217;t supply enough electricity, and cooling systems can&#8217;t dissipate the heat fast enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This&nbsp;forces a third approach: &#8220;scale-across,&#8221; distributing AI workloads across multiple data centres that might be in different cities or even&nbsp;different&nbsp;states. However, this creates a new problem—the connections between these facilities become critical bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-traditional-routers-fall-short\">Why traditional routers fall short</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI workloads behave differently from typical data centre traffic. Training runs generate massive, bursty traffic patterns—periods of intense data movement followed by relative quiet. If the network connecting data centres can&#8217;t absorb these surges, everything slows down, wasting expensive computing resources and, critically, time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional routing equipment&nbsp;wasn&#8217;t designed&nbsp;for this. Most routers prioritise either raw speed or sophisticated traffic management, but struggle to deliver both simultaneously while maintaining reasonable power consumption. For AI data centre interconnect applications, organisations need all three: speed, intelligent buffering, and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cisco-s-answer-the-8223-system\">Cisco&#8217;s answer: The 8223 system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cisco&#8217;s 8223 system represents a departure from general-purpose routing equipment. Housed in a compact three-rack-unit chassis, it delivers 64 ports of 800-gigabit connectivity—currently the highest density available in a fixed routing system. More importantly, it can process over 20 billion packets per second and scale up to three Exabytes per second of interconnect bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system&#8217;s distinguishing feature is deep buffering capability, enabled by the P200 chip. Think of buffers as temporary holding areas for data—like a reservoir that catches water during heavy rain.&nbsp;When AI training generates traffic surges, the 8223&#8217;s buffers absorb the spike, preventing network congestion that would otherwise slow down expensive GPU clusters&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;idle waiting for data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power efficiency is another critical advantage. As a 3RU system, the 8223 achieves what Cisco describes as &#8220;switch-like power efficiency&#8221; while maintaining routing capabilities—crucial when data centres are already straining power budgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also supports 800G coherent optics, enabling connections spanning up to 1,000 kilometres between facilities—essential for geographic distribution of AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-industry-adoption-and-real-world-applications\">Industry adoption and real-world applications</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Major hyperscalers are already deploying the technology.&nbsp;Microsoft, an early Silicon One&nbsp;adopter, has found the architecture valuable across multiple use cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Maltz,&nbsp;technical fellow&nbsp;and&nbsp;corporate vice president&nbsp;of Azure Networking at Microsoft, noted that &#8220;the common ASIC architecture has made it easier for us to expand from our initial use cases to multiple roles in DC, WAN, and AI/ML environments.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alibaba Cloud plans to use the P200 as a foundation for expanding its eCore architecture. Dennis Cai, vice president and head of network Infrastructure at Alibaba Cloud, stated the chip &#8220;will enable us to extend into the Core network, replacing traditional chassis-based routers with a cluster of P200-powered devices.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumen is also exploring how the technology fits into its network infrastructure plans. Dave Ward, chief technology officer and product officer at Lumen, said the company is &#8220;exploring how the new Cisco 8223 technology may fit into our plans to enhance network performance and roll out superior services to our customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-programmability-future-proofing-the-investment\">Programmability: Future-proofing the investment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One often-overlooked aspect of AI data centre interconnect infrastructure is adaptability. AI networking requirements are evolving rapidly, with new protocols and standards emerging regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional hardware typically requires replacement or expensive upgrades to support new capabilities. The P200&#8217;s programmability addresses this challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations can update the silicon to support emerging protocols without replacing hardware—important when individual routing systems represent significant capital investments and AI networking standards remain in flux.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-security-considerations\">Security considerations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting data centres hundreds of miles apart introduces security challenges. The 8223 includes line-rate encryption using post-quantum-resilient algorithms, addressing concerns about future threats from quantum computing. Integration with Cisco&#8217;s observability platforms provides detailed network monitoring to identify and resolve issues quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-cisco-compete\">Can Cisco compete?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Broadcom and Nvidia already staking their claims in the scale-across networking market, Cisco faces established competition.&nbsp;However, the company&nbsp;brings&nbsp;advantages: a long-standing presence in enterprise and service provider networks, the mature Silicon One portfolio launched in 2019, and relationships with major hyperscalers already&nbsp;using&nbsp;its technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 8223 ships initially with open-source SONiC support, with IOS XR planned for future availability. The P200 will be available across multiple platform types, including modular systems and the Nexus portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This flexibility in deployment options could prove decisive as organisations seek to avoid vendor lock-in while building out distributed AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Cisco&#8217;s approach becomes the industry standard for AI data centre interconnect remains to&nbsp;be seen, but the fundamental problem all three vendors are addressing—efficiently connecting distributed AI infrastructure—will only grow more pressing as AI systems continue scaling beyond single-facility limits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real winner may ultimately be determined not by technical specifications alone, but by which vendor can deliver the most complete ecosystem of software, support, and integration capabilities around their silicon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/cisco-securing-enterprises-in-the-ai-era/\">Cisco: Securing enterprises in the AI era</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

However, organisations anticipate a 32 percent increase in AI investment by 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey finds that AI and security are the joint top IT priorities for UK organisations over the next 18 months, with 62 percent of respondents citing them as necessary. These are followed by hybrid or multi-cloud strategies and virtualisation, showing a clear direction in the technological focus of British businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the path to AI integration isn’t straightforward. The vast majority of organisations are facing barriers to adoption, with the high costs of implementation and maintenance being the biggest concern for 34 percent of respondents. Data privacy and security issues are a close second, troubling 30 percent, while 28 percent are struggling with the integration of AI into their existing systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A particularly interesting finding is the prevalence of &#8220;shadow AI,&#8221; with 83 percent of organisations reporting the unauthorised use of AI tools by employees. This suggests a disconnect between official IT strategy and the day-to-day practices of the workforce, potentially introducing security risks and inefficiencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to navigate these challenges, UK organisations are increasingly turning to open source software. The survey reveals that 84 percent of respondents consider enterprise open source important for their AI strategy, with similarly high figures for virtualisation, hybrid and multi-cloud, and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Hodgson, UK Country Manager at Red Hat, said: “This year’s UK survey results show the gap between ambition and reality. Organisations are investing substantially in AI but currently only a few are delivering customer value. In the journey from experimentation to sustainable production, enterprise knowledge and integration with enterprise systems must pave the road to achieving value from AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Openness is a force for greater collaboration, sharing best practice and enabling flexibility. As is the case with successful hybrid cloud investments, open-source will continue to be the bedrock for making AI more consumable and reusable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey also explored the specific areas of AI that are being prioritised. Agentic AI, which involves systems that can operate <a href=\"https://www.developer-tech.com/news/gitlab-launches-custom-ai-agents-and-knowledge-graph/\">with a high degree of autonomy</a>, is the top priority for 68 percent of respondents. This is followed by the desire to enable broad employee adoption and to operationalise AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The skills gap remains a persistent challenge, with AI being the most urgent area of concern for the second consecutive year. Within the field of AI, the talent shortage is most acute in agentic AI, the ability to efficiently use AI capabilities, and educating the wider business on how to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these domestic challenges, there is a strong sense of optimism about the UK&#8217;s position on the global AI stage. 83 percent of respondents believe the UK is either already a global AI powerhouse or has the potential to become one within the next three years. However, this confidence is tempered by a lack of talent pipeline, limited public funding, and insufficient private sector engagement, which are seen as the main factors holding the UK back from extracting value from AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also touches on the complexities of cloud adoption, which is further complicated by the integration of AI workloads. Internal silos, sovereignty concerns, and unclear return on investment continue to be barriers. In response, UK organisations are prioritising operational control and autonomy, securing the software supply chain, and maintaining flexibility in their choice of IT suppliers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hans Roth, SVP and GM for EMEA at Red Hat, commented: “Organisations want greater operational control and IT resiliency to adapt in a world of constant disruption. The survey results, as well as our daily conversations, show sovereignty prominently on the agenda for enterprise’s ongoing cloud strategies and the budding AI opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Open-source is central to this shift as it provides businesses with the transparency and flexibility to innovate rapidly without compromise.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings from Red Hat&#8217;s latest survey show the UK is ready to tap the value potential of AI, but is also struggling with the practicalities of implementation, skills shortages, and the complexities of the technological environment. The strong emphasis on open-source suggests a pragmatic approach, supporting collaboration and flexibility in the pursuit of AI-driven innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/samsung-tiny-ai-model-beats-giant-reasoning-llms/\"><strong>Samsung’s tiny AI model beats giant reasoning LLMs</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Samsung’s work challenges the prevailing assumption that sheer scale is the only way to advance the capabilities of AI models, offering a more sustainable and parameter-efficient alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overcoming-the-limits-of-scale\">Overcoming the limits of scale</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While LLMs have shown incredible prowess in generating human-like text, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning can be brittle. Because they generate answers token-by-token, a single mistake early in the process can derail the entire solution, leading to an invalid final answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, where a model &#8220;thinks out loud&#8221; to break down a problem, have been developed to mitigate this. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often require vast amounts of high-quality reasoning data that may not be available, and can still produce flawed logic. Even with these augmentations, LLMs struggle with certain puzzles where perfect logical execution is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s work builds upon a recent AI model known as the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). HRM introduced a novel method using two small neural networks that recursively work on a problem at different frequencies to refine an answer. It showed great promise but was complicated, relying on uncertain biological arguments and complex fixed-point theorems that were not guaranteed to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of HRM&#8217;s two networks, TRM uses a single, tiny network that recursively improves both its internal &#8220;reasoning&#8221; and its proposed &#8220;answer&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model is given the question, an initial guess at the answer, and a latent reasoning feature. It first cycles through several steps to refine its latent reasoning based on all three inputs. Then, using this improved reasoning, it updates its prediction for the final answer. This entire process can be repeated up to 16 times, allowing the model to progressively correct its own mistakes in a highly parameter-efficient manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterintuitively, the research discovered that a tiny network with only two layers achieved far better generalisation than a four-layer version. This reduction in size appears to prevent the model from overfitting; a common problem when training on smaller, specialised datasets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRM also dispenses with the complex mathematical justifications used by its predecessor. The original HRM model required the assumption that its functions converged to a fixed point to justify its training method. TRM bypasses this entirely by simply back-propagating through its full recursion process. This change alone provided a massive boost in performance, improving accuracy on the Sudoku-Extreme benchmark from 56.5% to 87.4% in an ablation study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-samsung-s-model-smashes-ai-benchmarks-with-fewer-resources\">Samsung’s model smashes AI benchmarks with fewer resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The results speak for themselves. On the Sudoku-Extreme dataset, which uses only 1,000 training examples, TRM achieves an 87.4% test accuracy, a huge leap from HRM&#8217;s 55%. On Maze-Hard, a task involving finding long paths through 30&#215;30 mazes, TRM scores 85.3% compared to HRM&#8217;s 74.5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most notably, TRM makes huge strides on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), a benchmark designed to measure true fluid intelligence in AI. With just 7M parameters, TRM achieves 44.6% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 7.8% on ARC-AGI-2. This outperforms HRM, which used a 27M parameter model, and even surpasses many of the world&#8217;s largest LLMs. For comparison, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores only 4.9% on ARC-AGI-2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The training process for TRM has also been made more efficient. An adaptive mechanism called ACT – which decides when the model has improved an answer enough and can move to a new data sample – was simplified to remove the need for a second, costly forward pass through the network during each training step. This change was made with no major difference in final generalisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This research from Samsung presents a compelling argument against the current trajectory of ever-expanding AI models. It shows that by designing architectures that can iteratively reason and self-correct, it is possible to solve extremely difficult problems with a tiny fraction of the computational resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-new-ai-agent-rewrites-code-automate-vulnerability-fixes/\"><strong>Google’s new AI agent rewrites code to automate vulnerability fixes</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

However, it&#8217;s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br>&nbsp;<br>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>&#8220;Automated Failure Attribution.&#8221;</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The paper has been accepted as a

Contributions</strong><br>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br>1.<strong> Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize &#8220;automated failure attribution&#8221; as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task&#8217;s failure.<br>2. <strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<br><strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<br><strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<br><strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Exploring Initial &#8220;Automated Attribution&#8221; Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br>&#8211; All-at-Once: This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br>&#8211; Step-by-Step: This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br>&#8211; Binary Search: A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong> <br>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:<br>&#8211; <strong>A Long Way to Go</strong>: Current methods are far from perfect. Even the best-performing single method achieved an accuracy of only about <strong>53.5%</strong> in identifying the responsible agent and a mere <strong>14.2%</strong> in pinpointing the exact error step. Some methods performed even worse than random guessing, underscoring the difficulty of the task.<br>&#8211; <strong>No &#8220;All-in-One&#8221; Solution</strong>: Different methods excel at different aspects of the problem.

State-of-the-Art Models Struggle: </strong>Surprisingly, even the most advanced reasoning models, like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, find this task challenging.- This highlights the inherent difficulty of automated failure attribution, which demands a higher level of reasoning than what is required for more conventional tasks.<br>&#8211; <strong>The Importance of Explicit Reasoning</strong>:

However, contemporary robot navigation systems face significant challenges in diverse and complex indoor environments, exposing the limitations of traditional approaches. Addressing the fundamental questions of &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;, &#8220;Where am I going?&#8221;, and &#8220;How do I get there?&#8221;, ByteDance has developed Astra, an innovative dual-model architecture designed to overcome these traditional navigation bottlenecks and enable general-purpose mobile robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional navigation systems typically consist of multiple, smaller, and often rule-based modules to handle the core challenges of target localization, self-localization, and path planning. Target localization involves understanding natural language or image cues to pinpoint a destination on a map. Self-localization requires a robot to determine its precise position within a map, especially challenging in repetitive environments like warehouses where traditional methods often rely on artificial landmarks (e.g., QR codes). Path planning further divides into global planning for rough route generation and local planning for real-time obstacle avoidance and reaching intermediate waypoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While foundation models have shown promise in integrating smaller models to tackle broader tasks, the optimal number of models and their effective integration for comprehensive navigation remained an open question. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"243\" data-attachment-id=\"47239\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1183/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=1080%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=950%2C243&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=950%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47239\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C262&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=600%2C153&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ByteDance&#8217;s Astra, detailed in their paper &#8220;Astra: Toward General-Purpose Mobile Robots via Hierarchical Multimodal Learning&#8221; (website: <a href=\"https://astra-mobility.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://astra-mobility.github.io/</a>), addresses these limitations. Following the System 1/System 2 paradigm, Astra features two primary sub-models: <strong>Astra-Global</strong> and <strong>Astra-Local</strong>. Astra-Global handles low-frequency tasks like target and self-localization, while Astra-Local manages high-frequency tasks such as local path planning and odometry estimation. This architecture promises to revolutionize how robots navigate complex indoor spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"478\" data-attachment-id=\"47241\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1184/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=1080%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,543\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=950%2C478&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=950%2C478&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=600%2C302&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astra-Global: The Intelligent Brain for Global Localization</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Global serves as the intelligent core of the Astra architecture, responsible for critical low-frequency tasks: self-localization and target localization. It functions as a <strong>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)</strong>, adept at processing both visual and linguistic inputs to achieve precise global positioning within a map. Its strength lies in utilizing a <strong>hybrid topological-semantic graph</strong> as contextual input, allowing the model to accurately locate positions based on query images or text prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction of this robust localization system begins with <strong>offline mapping</strong>. The research team developed an offline method to build a hybrid topological-semantic graph G=(V,E,L):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>V (Nodes):</strong> Keyframes, obtained by temporal downsampling of input video and SfM-estimated 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) camera poses, act as nodes encoding camera poses and landmark references.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>E (Edges):</strong> Undirected edges establish connectivity based on relative node poses, crucial for global path planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>L (Landmarks):</strong> Semantic landmark information is extracted by Astra-Global from visual data at each node, enriching the map&#8217;s semantic understanding. These landmarks store semantic attributes and are connected to multiple nodes via co-visibility relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In practical localization, Astra-Global&#8217;s self-localization and target localization capabilities leverage a <strong>coarse-to-fine two-stage process</strong> for visual-language localization. The coarse stage analyzes input images and localization prompts, detects landmarks, establishes correspondence with a pre-built landmark map, and filters candidates based on visual consistency. The fine stage then uses the query image and coarse output to sample reference map nodes from the offline map, comparing their visual and positional information to directly output the predicted pose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"725\" data-attachment-id=\"47242\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1185/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=1080%2C824&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,824\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=950%2C725&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=950%2C725&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47242\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=1024%2C781&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=768%2C586&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=600%2C458&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>language-based target localization</strong>, the model interprets natural language instructions, identifies relevant landmarks using their functional descriptions within the map, and then leverages landmark-to-node association mechanisms to locate relevant nodes, retrieving target images and 6-DoF poses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To empower Astra-Global with robust localization abilities, the team employed a meticulous training methodology. Using <strong>Qwen2.5-VL</strong> as the backbone, they combined <strong>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)</strong> with <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong>. SFT involved diverse datasets for various tasks, including coarse and fine localization, co-visibility detection, and motion trend estimation. In the GRPO phase, a rule-based reward function (including format, landmark extraction, map matching, and extra landmark rewards) was used to train for visual-language localization. Experiments showed GRPO significantly improved Astra-Global&#8217;s zero-shot generalization, achieving 99.9% localization accuracy in unseen home environments, surpassing SFT-only methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astra-Local: The Intelligent Assistant for Local Planning</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Local acts as the intelligent assistant for Astra&#8217;s high-frequency tasks, a multi-task network capable of efficiently generating local paths and accurately estimating odometry from sensor data.

It begins with a <strong>3D spatial encoder</strong> that processes N omnidirectional images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) and Lift-Splat-Shoot to convert 2D image features into 3D voxel features. This 3D encoder is trained using self-supervised learning via 3D volumetric differentiable neural rendering. The 4D spatio-temporal encoder then builds upon the 3D encoder, taking past voxel features and future timestamps as input to predict future voxel features through ResNet and DiT modules, providing current and future environmental representations for planning and odometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>planning head</strong>, based on pre-trained 4D features, robot speed, and task information, generates executable trajectories using <strong>Transformer-based flow matching</strong>. To prevent collisions, the planning head incorporates a <strong>masked ESDF loss</strong> (Euclidean Signed Distance Field). This loss calculates the ESDF of a 3D occupancy map and applies a 2D ground truth trajectory mask, significantly reducing collision rates. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance in collision rate and overall score on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets compared to other methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>odometry head</strong> predicts the robot&#8217;s relative pose using current and past 4D features and additional sensor data (e.g., IMU, wheel data). It trains a Transformer model to fuse information from different sensors. Each sensor modality is processed by a specific tokenizer, combined with modality embeddings and temporal positional embeddings, fed into a Transformer encoder, and finally uses a CLS token to predict relative pose. Experiments showed the odometry head&#8217;s excellent performance in multi-sensor fusion and pose estimation, significantly improving rotational accuracy and reducing overall trajectory error.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Validation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Extensive experiments were conducted in diverse indoor environments (warehouses, offices, homes) to comprehensively evaluate Astra&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Global&#8217;s multimodal localization capabilities were validated through various experiments, demonstrating superior performance in handling text and image localization queries. For target localization, it accurately identifies matching images and poses based on text commands (e.g., &#8220;find the resting area&#8221;). Compared to traditional Visual Place Recognition (VPR) methods, Astra-Global exhibits significant advantages in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Detail Capture:</strong> Unlike VPR&#8217;s reliance on global features, Astra-Global precisely captures fine details like room numbers, preventing localization errors in similar scenes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Viewpoint Robustness:</strong> Based on semantic landmarks, Astra-Global maintains stable localization even with large camera angle changes, where VPR methods typically fail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pose Accuracy:</strong> Astra-Global leverages landmark spatial relationships to select the best matching pose, showing significantly higher pose accuracy (within 1-meter distance error and 5-degree angular error) than traditional VPR, with over 30% improvement in warehouse environments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

planning and odometry heads were thoroughly evaluated. The planning head, using Transformer-based flow matching and masked ESDF loss, outperformed methods like ACT and diffusion policies in collision rate, speed, and overall score on OOD datasets. This highlights the masked ESDF loss&#8217;s effectiveness in mitigating collision risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odometry head&#8217;s performance was assessed on multimodal datasets including synchronized image sequences, IMU, wheel data, and ground truth poses. Compared to two-frame BEV-ODOM baselines, Astra-Local&#8217;s odometry head showed significant advantages in multi-sensor fusion and pose estimation. Integrating IMU data dramatically improved rotational estimation accuracy, reducing overall trajectory error to approximately 2%. Further inclusion of wheel data enhanced scale stability and estimation accuracy, validating its superior multi-sensor data fusion capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra holds significant promise for future development and applications. Its deployment can be expanded to more complex indoor environments like large shopping malls, hospitals, and libraries, where it can assist in tasks such as precise product location, efficient medical supply delivery, and book organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, areas for improvement exist. For Astra-Global, while current map representations balance information loss and token length, they may occasionally lack critical semantic details. Future work will focus on alternative map compression methods to optimize efficiency while maximizing semantic information retention. Additionally, current single-frame localization can fail in feature-scarce or highly repetitive environments; future plans include active exploration mechanisms and temporal reasoning for more robust localization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Astra-Local, improving robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is crucial, requiring enhanced model architectures and training methods. Redesigning the fallback system for tighter integration and seamless switching is also planned to improve system stability. Furthermore, integrating instruction-following capabilities will enable robots to understand and execute natural language commands, expanding their usability in dynamic, human-centric environments and fostering more natural human-robot interaction.</p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/\">ByteDance Introduces Astra: A Dual-Model Architecture for Autonomous Robot Navigation</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>27</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47236</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MIT Researchers Unveil &#8220;SEAL&#8221;: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</title>\n\t\t<link>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Synced]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:58:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://syncedreview.com/?p=47227</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>MIT introduces SEAL, a framework enabling large language models to self-edit and update their weights via reinforcement learning.</p>\nThe post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/\">MIT Researchers Unveil “SEAL”: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of AI self-improvement has been a hot topic in recent research circles, with a flurry of papers emerging and prominent figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighing in on the future of self-evolving intelligent systems. Now, a new paper from MIT, titled &#8220;Self-Adapting Language Models,&#8221; introduces <strong>SEAL (Self-Adapting LLMs)</strong>, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to update their own weights. This development is seen as another significant step towards the realization of truly self-evolving AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research paper, published yesterday, has already ignited considerable discussion, including on Hacker News. SEAL proposes a method where an LLM can generate its own training data through &#8220;self-editing&#8221; and subsequently update its weights based on new inputs. Crucially, this self-editing process is learned via reinforcement learning, with the reward mechanism tied to the updated model&#8217;s downstream performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MGQwYzg0MGE5ZDk3ZWNhOTFiZGJmOGM5MWFhZmU3ZjZfVEJVbjJ5U3o5TEgxeTVEZjZwWkozdE5PZGozeTN3dnZfVG9rZW46RjJvS2JFMUZWb0NIV0N4S1pCeGMzZFg4blVlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of this paper is particularly notable given the recent surge in interest surrounding AI self-evolution. Earlier this month, several other research efforts garnered attention, including Sakana AI and the University of British Columbia&#8217;s &#8220;Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM),&#8221; CMU&#8217;s &#8220;Self-Rewarding Training (SRT),&#8221; Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#8217;s &#8220;MM-UPT&#8221; framework for continuous self-improvement in multimodal large models, and the &#8220;UI-Genie&#8221; self-improvement framework from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in collaboration with vivo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the buzz, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently shared his vision of a future with self-improving AI and robots in his blog post, &#8220;The Gentle Singularity.&#8221; He posited that while the initial millions of humanoid robots would need traditional manufacturing, they would then be able to &#8220;operate the entire supply chain to build more robots, which can in turn build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, and so on.&#8221; This was quickly followed by a tweet from @VraserX, claiming an OpenAI insider revealed the company was already running recursively self-improving AI internally, a claim that sparked widespread debate about its veracity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the specifics of internal OpenAI developments, the MIT paper on SEAL provides concrete evidence of AI&#8217;s progression towards self-evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding SEAL: Self-Adapting Language Models</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The core idea behind SEAL is to enable language models to improve themselves when encountering new data by generating their own synthetic data and optimizing their parameters through self-editing. The model&#8217;s training objective is to directly generate these self-edits (SEs) using data provided within the model&#8217;s context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The generation of these self-edits is learned through reinforcement learning. The model is rewarded when the generated self-edits, once applied, lead to improved performance on the target task. Therefore, SEAL can be conceptualized as an algorithm with two nested loops: an outer reinforcement learning (RL) loop that optimizes the generation of self-edits, and an inner update loop that uses the generated self-edits to update the model via gradient descent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method can be viewed as an instance of meta-learning, where the focus is on how to generate effective self-edits in a meta-learning fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=NDFkZjA3MDJjMzZjYWMyMDVhMDRmYmVhZGZjZWE5Y2ZfT0YzUldDMFE2c1g1YjVQaEhPdFBtdG45bjhqOTByWDNfVG9rZW46WTNBdmJwTTV0b0xCSlF4emhPS2NBVUU5bm9iXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A General Framework</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>SEAL operates on a single task instance (C,τ), where C is context information relevant to the task, and τ defines the downstream evaluation for assessing the model&#8217;s adaptation. For example, in a knowledge integration task, C might be a passage to be integrated into the model&#8217;s internal knowledge, and τ a set of questions about that passage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given C, the model generates a self-edit SE, which then updates its parameters through supervised fine-tuning: θ′←SFT(θ,SE). Reinforcement learning is used to optimize this self-edit generation: the model performs an action (generates SE), receives a reward r based on LMθ′&#8217;s performance on τ, and updates its policy to maximize the expected reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers found that traditional online policy methods like GRPO and PPO led to unstable training. They ultimately opted for ReST^EM, a simpler, filtering-based behavioral cloning approach from a DeepMind paper. This method can be viewed as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process, where the E-step samples candidate outputs from the current model policy, and the M-step reinforces only those samples that yield a positive reward through supervised fine-tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper also notes that while the current implementation uses a single model to generate and learn from self-edits, these roles could be separated in a &#8220;teacher-student&#8221; setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Instantiating SEAL in Specific Domains</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The MIT team instantiated SEAL in two specific domains: <strong>knowledge integration</strong> and <strong>few-shot learning</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Knowledge Integration:</strong> The goal here is to effectively integrate information from articles into the model&#8217;s weights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Few-Shot Learning:</strong> This involves the model adapting to new tasks with very few examples.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The experimental results for both few-shot learning and knowledge integration demonstrate the effectiveness of the SEAL framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>few-shot learning</strong>, using a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model, SEAL significantly improved adaptation success rates, achieving 72.5% compared to 20% for models using basic self-edits without RL training, and 0% without adaptation. While still below &#8220;Oracle TTT&#8221; (an idealized baseline), this indicates substantial progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MjE5YmIxODllMDlmMjc1MDRkOGM3MWVlNDhiNzlmOThfOVRqYW04NEN3UEtCT3ZmZUR0RFRZSTFSRFk5cTh3eW9fVG9rZW46U0dOOGIySVhQb0FzZzV4RjRmRmNRVnI5bjNlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>knowledge integration</strong>, using a larger Qwen2.5-7B model to integrate new facts from SQuAD articles, SEAL consistently outperformed baseline methods. Training with synthetically generated data from the base Qwen-2.5-7B model already showed notable improvements, and subsequent reinforcement learning further boosted performance. The accuracy also showed rapid improvement over external RL iterations, often surpassing setups using GPT-4.1 generated data within just two iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZDQwZTAyN2NmMjYyYjFhNDAyNGY2MTYyNDE2NmMwNGVfOFVHSHdtN2V5NEQ0MGFBdU9kSHJzcjlIQVVPalBtNHhfVG9rZW46VVBOUWJwM0pab0lNMGJ4R0s3NmNXUlAybkFlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualitative examples from the paper illustrate how reinforcement learning leads to the generation of more detailed self-edits, resulting in improved performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While promising, the researchers also acknowledge some limitations of the SEAL framework, including aspects related to catastrophic forgetting, computational overhead, and context-dependent evaluation. These are discussed in detail in the original paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Original Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Project Site: <a href=\"https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/\">MIT Researchers Unveil “SEAL”: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>31</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47227</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Researchers from PSU and Duke introduce &#8220;Multi-Agent Systems Automated Failure Attribution</title>\n\t\t<link>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/researchers-from-psu-and-duke-introduce-multi-agent-systems-automated-failure-attribution/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/researchers-from-psu-and-duke-introduce-multi-agent-systems-automated-failure-attribution/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Synced]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 07:39:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nature Language Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Share My Research]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://syncedreview.com/?p=47209</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\"Automated failure attribution\" is a crucial component in the development lifecycle of Multi-Agent systems.

However, it&#8217;s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br> <br>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br> <br>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>&#8220;Automated Failure Attribution.&#8221;</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.<br>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"602\"

when a system fails, developers are often left with manual and inefficient methods for debugging:<br><strong>Manual Log Archaeology</strong> : Developers must manually review lengthy interaction logs to find the source of the problem.<br><strong>Reliance on Expertise</strong> : The debugging process is highly dependent on the developer&#8217;s deep understanding of the system and the task at hand.<br> <br>This &#8220;needle in a haystack&#8221; approach to debugging is not only inefficient but also severely hinders rapid system iteration and the improvement of system reliability. There is an urgent need for an automated, systematic method to pinpoint the cause of failures, effectively bridging the gap between &#8220;evaluation results&#8221; and &#8220;system improvement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><br><strong>Core Contributions</strong><br>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br>1. <strong>Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize &#8220;automated failure attribution&#8221; as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task&#8217;s failure.<br><br><strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<br><em><strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<br><strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<br><strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Exploring Initial &#8220;Automated Attribution&#8221; Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br><strong>All-at-Once: </strong>This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br><strong>Binary Search: </strong>A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.<br><strong> </strong><br><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A Long Way to Go</strong>: Current methods are far from perfect.

promise for artificial intelligence, enabling agents to plan and reason in dynamic environments. Recent advancements, particularly with video diffusion models, have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic future sequences. However, a significant bottleneck remains: <strong>maintaining long-term memory.</strong> Current models struggle to remember events and states from far in the past due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences using traditional attention layers. This limits their ability to perform complex tasks requiring sustained understanding of a scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new paper, &#8220;Long-Context State-Space Video World Models&#8221; by researchers from Stanford University, Princeton University, and Adobe Research, proposes an innovative solution to this challenge. They introduce a novel architecture that leverages <strong>State-Space Models (SSMs)</strong> to extend temporal memory without sacrificing computational efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core problem lies in the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms with respect to sequence length. As the video context grows, the resources required for attention layers explode, making long-term memory impractical for real-world applications. This means that after a certain number of frames, the model effectively &#8220;forgets&#8221; earlier events, hindering its performance on tasks that demand long-range coherence or reasoning over extended periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors’ key insight is to leverage the inherent strengths of State-Space Models (SSMs) for causal sequence modeling. Unlike previous attempts that retrofitted SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, this work fully exploits their advantages in processing sequences efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed <strong>Long-Context State-Space Video World Model (LSSVWM)</strong> incorporates several crucial design choices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Block-wise SSM Scanning Scheme:</strong> This is central to their design. Instead of processing the entire video sequence with a single SSM scan, they employ a block-wise scheme. This strategically trades off some spatial consistency (within a block) for significantly extended temporal memory. By breaking down the long sequence into manageable blocks, they can maintain a compressed &#8220;state&#8221; that carries information across blocks, effectively extending the model&#8217;s memory horizon.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dense Local Attention:</strong> To compensate for the potential loss of spatial coherence introduced by the block-wise SSM scanning, the model incorporates dense local attention. This ensures that consecutive frames within and across blocks maintain strong relationships, preserving the fine-grained details and consistency necessary for realistic video generation. This dual approach of global (SSM) and local (attention) processing allows them to achieve both long-term memory and local fidelity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"586\" height=\"883\" data-attachment-id=\"47188\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1175/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"586,883\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=586%2C883&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47188\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?w=586&amp;ssl=1 586w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper also introduces two key training strategies to further improve long-context performance:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Diffusion Forcing:</strong> This technique encourages the model to generate frames conditioned on a prefix of the input, effectively forcing it to learn to maintain consistency over longer durations. By sometimes not sampling a prefix and keeping all tokens noised, the training becomes equivalent to diffusion forcing, which is highlighted as a special case of long-context training where the prefix length is zero. This pushes the model to generate coherent sequences even from minimal initial context.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Frame Local Attention:</strong> For faster training and sampling, the authors implemented a &#8220;frame local attention&#8221; mechanism. This utilizes FlexAttention to achieve significant speedups compared to a fully causal mask. By grouping frames into chunks (e.g., chunks of 5 with a frame window size of 10), frames within a chunk maintain bidirectionality while also attending to frames in the previous chunk. This allows for an effective receptive field while optimizing computational load.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"605\" height=\"729\" data-attachment-id=\"47189\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1176/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"605,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=605%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47189\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?w=605&amp;ssl=1 605w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1 249w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=600%2C723&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers evaluated their LSSVWM on challenging datasets, including <strong>Memory Maze</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong>, which are specifically designed to test long-term memory capabilities through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiments demonstrate that their approach <strong>substantially surpasses baselines</strong> in preserving long-range memory. Qualitative results, as shown in supplementary figures (e.g., S1, S2, S3), illustrate that LSSVWM can generate more coherent and accurate sequences over extended periods compared to models relying solely on causal attention or even Mamba2 without frame local attention. For instance, on reasoning tasks for the maze dataset, their model maintains better consistency and accuracy over long horizons. Similarly, for retrieval tasks, LSSVWM shows improved ability to recall and utilize information from distant past frames. Crucially, these improvements are achieved while maintaining practical inference speeds, making the models suitable for interactive applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"595\" height=\"339\" data-attachment-id=\"47190\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1177/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"595,339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=595%2C339&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47190\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paper<em> Long-Context State-Space Video World Models</em> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20171\" title=\"\">arXiv</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/\">Adobe Research Unlocking Long-Term Memory in Video World Models with State-Space Models</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>53</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47184</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DeepSeek-V3 New Paper is coming!

The paper moves beyond the architectural specifics of DeepSeek-V3 to explore how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address the limitations of current hardware, ultimately enabling cost-efficient large-scale training and inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AU-vFtGM354SLx9Rm.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Paper Insights into DeepSeek-V3: Scaling Challenges and Reflections on Hardware for AI Architectures is on arXiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6451\">The rapid scaling of LLMs has exposed critical bottlenecks in current hardware architectures, particularly concerning memory capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnect bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3, trained on a cluster of 2048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, serves as a compelling case study demonstrating how a synergistic approach between model design and hardware considerations can overcome these limitations. This research focuses on the interplay between hardware architecture and model design in achieving economical large-scale training and inference, aiming to provide actionable insights for efficiently scaling LLMs without compromising performance or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e9e4\">Key areas of focus in the paper include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hardware-Driven Model Design:</strong> Analyzing how hardware characteristics, such as FP8 low-precision computation and scale-up/scale-out network properties, influence architectural choices within DeepSeek-V3.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hardware-Model Interdependencies:</strong> Investigating how hardware capabilities shape model innovation and how the evolving demands of LLMs drive requirements for next-generation hardware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Future Directions for Hardware Development:</strong> Drawing practical insights from DeepSeek-V3 to guide the co-design of future hardware and model architectures for scalable and cost-effective AI systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"f3cf\">DeepSeek-V3’s Design Principles: Addressing Core Scaling Challenges</h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A-MtwoD3wGPIBwQYY.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7858\">DeepSeek-V3 incorporates several key architectural innovations, as illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper, including the DeepSeekMoE architecture and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). These designs directly tackle the core challenges of scaling LLMs: memory efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and inference speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abab\">Memory Efficiency: MLA and KV Cache Optimization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e0c2\">LLMs exhibit exponential growth in memory demands, outpacing the slower growth of high-speed memory like HBM. While multi-node parallelism offers a solution, optimizing memory usage at the source remains crucial. DeepSeek addresses this bottleneck with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), which employs projection matrices to compress the key-value (KV) representations of all attention heads into a smaller latent vector, trained jointly with the model. During inference, only this compressed latent vector needs to be cached, significantly reducing memory consumption compared to storing full KV caches for each head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"72c0\">Beyond MLA, DeepSeek highlights other valuable techniques for KV cache size reduction, providing inspiration for future advancements in memory-efficient attention mechanisms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Shared KV (GQA; MQA):</strong> Multiple attention heads share a single set of key-value pairs, drastically compressing storage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Window KV:</strong> Limiting the context window for KV caching.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quantization Compression:</strong> Reducing the precision of stored KV values.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"60fa\">Table 1 in the paper compares the per-token KV cache memory footprint of DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5 72B, and LLaMA-3.1 405B. DeepSeek-V3 achieves a remarkable reduction, requiring only 70 KB per token, significantly lower than LLaMA-3.1 405B’s 516 KB and Qwen-2.5 72B’s 327 KB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2Al0SsgV8-Q9V7A_HZ.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5af3\">Cost-Effectiveness: DeepSeekMoE for Sparse Computation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"075a\">For sparse computation, DeepSeek developed DeepSeekMoE, an advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (Figure 1, bottom right). MoE models offer two key advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduced Training Compute:</strong> By selectively activating a subset of expert parameters per token, MoE architectures allow for a substantial increase in the total number of parameters while maintaining manageable computational demands. For instance, DeepSeek-V3 boasts 671B parameters, nearly three times that of its predecessor V2 (236B), yet only activates 37B parameters per token. In contrast, dense models like Qwen2.5–72B and LLaMa3.1–405B require all parameters to be active during training. Table 2 demonstrates that DeepSeekV3 achieves comparable or superior performance to these dense models with an order of magnitude less computational cost (around 250 GFLOPS per token vs. 394 GFLOPS for the 72B dense model and 2448 GFLOPS for the 405B dense model).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantages for Personal Use and Local Deployment:</strong> The selective activation of parameters in MoE models translates to significantly lower memory and compute requirements during single-request inference. DeepSeek-V2 (236B parameters), for example, only activates 21B parameters during inference, enabling near or above 20 tokens per second (TPS) on AI SoC-equipped personal computers — a capability far exceeding that of similarly sized dense models on comparable hardware. This opens possibilities for personalized LLM agents running locally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A8N5gp31XFnPbEMjo.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4ae2\">Enhanced Inference Speed: Overlapping Computation and Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cd02\">DeepSeek prioritizes both system-level maximum throughput and single-request latency for inference speed. To maximize throughput, the model employs a dual micro-batch overlapping architecture from the outset, intentionally overlapping communication latency with computation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"76af\">Furthermore, DeepSeek decouples the computation of MLA and MoE into distinct stages. While one micro-batch performs part of the MLA or MoE computation, the other concurrently executes the corresponding scheduling communication. Conversely, during the second micro-batch’s computation phase, the first micro-batch undertakes the combine communication step. This pipelined approach enables seamless overlap of all-to-all communication with continuous computation, ensuring full GPU utilization. In production, DeepSeek utilizes a prefill and decode separation architecture, assigning large-batch prefill and latency-sensitive decode requests to different-sized expert-parallel groups, maximizing system throughput under real-world serving conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6953\">The paper also touches upon the importance of test-time scaling for reasoning models and highlights the critical role of high token output speed in reinforcement learning workflows and for reducing user-perceived latency in long inference sequences. Optimizing inference speed through hardware-software co-innovation is therefore paramount for the efficiency of reasoning models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a381\">Low-Precision Driven Design: FP8 Training and LogFMT</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"00fd\">FP8 Mixed-Precision Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9f4b\">While quantization techniques like GPTQ and AWQ have significantly reduced memory requirements primarily for inference, DeepSeek has pioneered the use of FP8 mixed-precision training for a large-scale MoE model. Despite NVIDIA’s Transformer Engine supporting FP8, DeepSeek-V3 marks a significant step as the first publicly known large model to leverage FP8 for training. This achievement, resulting from close collaboration between infrastructure and algorithm teams, along with extensive experimentation, significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining model quality, making large-scale training more feasible. Figure 1 illustrates the FP8 precision used in the forward and backward passes during training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"452f\">LogFMT for Efficient Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"57a1\">DeepSeek also employs low-precision compression for network communication within the DeepSeek-V3 architecture. During EP parallelism, tokens are scheduled using fine-grained FP8 quantization, reducing communication volume by 50% compared to BF16, thereby significantly shortening communication time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"73e8\">Beyond traditional floating-point formats, DeepSeek experimented with a novel data type called LogFMT-nBit (Logarithmic Floating-Point Formats).</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3a44\">Interconnect-Driven Design: Addressing Hardware Limitations</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6918\">Current Hardware Architecture and its Constraints</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"de6a\">DeepSeek currently utilizes the NVIDIA H800 GPU SXM architecture (Figure 2), which, while based on the Hopper architecture similar to the H100, features reduced FP64 compute performance and NVLink bandwidth (400 GB/s down from 900 GB/s in H100) due to regulatory requirements. This significant reduction in intra-node scaling bandwidth poses challenges for high-performance workloads. To compensate, each node is equipped with eight 400G Infiniband (IB) CX7 network interface cards (NICs) to enhance inter-node scaling capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2ArKo4pTKD63B5fbSU.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c1f8\">Hardware-Aware Parallelization and Model Co-design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2310\">To navigate the limitations of the H800 architecture, the DeepSeek-V3 model incorporates hardware-aware design considerations for parallelization, including: avoiding Tensor Parallelism (TP), enhancing Pipeline Parallelism (PP), and accelerating Expert Parallelism (EP). Specific details of these strategies are available in the original paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e3ec\">A key aspect of model co-design is “node-aware routing” for the TopK expert selection strategy in the MoE architecture. Given the approximately 4:1 bandwidth difference between intra-node (NVLink, ~160 GB/s effective) and inter-node (IB, ~40 GB/s effective per NIC) communication, DeepSeek designed the routing to leverage the higher intra-node bandwidth. By grouping the 256 routing experts (4 per GPU in an 8-node, 64-GPU setup) into 8 groups of 32 experts, each residing on a single node, and algorithmically ensuring that each token is routed to at most 4 nodes, DeepSeek mitigates the IB communication bottleneck and improves effective communication bandwidth during training. Tokens destined for experts on the same node can be sent via IB once and then forwarded via NVLink, reducing redundant IB traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8584\">Scale-Up and Scale-Out Convergence: Future Hardware Directions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e4f5\">While node-aware routing reduces bandwidth demands, the bandwidth disparity between NVLink and IB complicates the implementation of communication-intensive kernels. Currently, GPU Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) handle both network message processing and data forwarding via NVLink, consuming significant compute resources. DeepSeek advocates for integrating intra-node (scale-up) and inter-node (scale-out) communication into a unified framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bb45\">Integrating dedicated co-processors for network traffic management and seamless forwarding between NVLink and IB domains could reduce software complexity and maximize bandwidth utilization. Hardware support for dynamic traffic deduplication could further optimize strategies like DeepSeek-V3’s node-aware routing. DeepSeek also explores emerging interconnect protocols like Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) and Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink), noting the Unified Bus (UB) as a recent approach to converging scale-up and scale-out. The paper details methods for achieving this convergence at the programming framework level, including unified network adapters, dedicated communication co-processors, flexible forwarding and broadcast/reduce mechanisms, and hardware synchronization primitives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7303\">Bandwidth Contention and Latency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0faa\">Another limitation of current hardware is the lack of flexibility in dynamically allocating bandwidth between different traffic types on NVLink and PCIe. For instance, transferring KV cache data from CPU memory to GPUs during inference can saturate PCIe bandwidth, leading to contention with inter-GPU EP communication via IB, potentially degrading overall performance and causing latency spikes. DeepSeek suggests solutions including dynamic NVLink/PCIe traffic prioritization, I/O chiplet integration, and CPU-GPU interconnect within the scale-up domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3982\">Large-Scale Network-Driven Design: Multi-Plane Fat-Tree</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e8c0\">Network Co-design: Multi-Plane Fat-Tree</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fefd\">For DeepSeek-V3 training, a Multi-Plane Fat-Tree (MPFT) scale-out network was deployed (Figure 3). Each node, equipped with 8 GPUs and 8 IB NICs, assigns each GPU-NIC pair to a different network plane. Additionally, each node has a 400 Gbps Ethernet RoCE NIC connected to a separate storage network plane for accessing the 3FS distributed file system. The scale-out network utilizes 64-port 400G IB switches, theoretically supporting up to 16,384 GPUs while retaining the cost and latency advantages of a two-layer network. However, due to policy and regulatory constraints, the actual deployment involved over two thousand GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AOtuIGcZsxVrUTbvo.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"92c6\">The deployed MPFT network did not fully realize its intended architecture due to current limitations of the IB ConnectX-7. Ideally (Figure 4), each NIC would have multiple physical ports, each connected to a separate network plane but presented to the user as a single logical interface via port bonding. This would allow a single Queue Pair (QP) to seamlessly send and receive messages across all available ports, similar to packet spraying. Native out-of-order layout support within the NIC would be necessary to ensure message consistency and correct ordering semantics, as packets from the same QP might traverse different network paths and arrive out of order. InfiniBand ConnectX-8 natively supports four planes, and future NICs with full support for advanced multi-plane capabilities will significantly benefit the scalability of two-layer fat-tree networks for large AI clusters. Overall, multi-plane architectures offer significant advantages in fault isolation, robustness, load balancing, and scalability for large systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A8ibInf8M-5okJZ_g.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3347\">DeepSeek highlights several advantages of MPFT, including its composition as a subset of Multi-Rail Fat-Tree (MRFT) allowing seamless integration of existing NVIDIA and NCCL optimizations for MRFT networks, cost-effectiveness, traffic isolation, reduced latency, and robustness. Performance analysis comparing MPFT and MRFT (Figures 5 and 6, Table 4) revealed that the all-to-all performance of multi-plane networks is very similar to single-plane multi-rail networks, and the performance of MPFT and MRFT was nearly identical when training the V3 model on 2048 GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AO6-6IW1BxXA9snkO.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2Ahwaa9vPQoLilXeQR.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AxEMD_5lpKKze1_O_.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c430\">Low-Latency Networking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bd68\">In DeepSeek’s model inference, large-scale EP heavily relies on all-to-all communication, which is sensitive to both bandwidth and latency. Even microsecond-level inherent network latency can significantly impact system performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ec4\">DeepSeek analyzes the latency characteristics of IB and RoCE (Table 5), noting IB’s consistently lower latency, making it preferable for latency-sensitive workloads like distributed training and inference. While RoCE offers a potentially cost-effective alternative, its current latency and scalability limitations prevent it from fully meeting the demands of large-scale AI systems. DeepSeek proposes specific improvements for RoCE, including dedicated low-latency RoCE switches, optimized routing policies, and enhanced traffic isolation or congestion control mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2ATEhtKdIlZaDVR_qf.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"78b7\">To further reduce network communication latency, DeepSeek utilizes InfiniBand GPUDirect Async (IBGDA). Traditionally, network communication involves CPU proxy threads, introducing additional overhead. IBGDA allows GPUs to directly populate Work Request (WR) content and write to RDMA doorbell MMIO addresses, eliminating the significant latency associated with GPU-CPU communication. By managing the entire control plane within the GPU, IBGDA avoids CPU bottlenecks, especially when sending numerous small packets, as the GPU’s parallel threads can distribute the workload. DeepSeek’s DeepEP and other works have demonstrated significant performance gains using IBGDA, leading DeepSeek to advocate for broad support of such features across various accelerator devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"b8d1\">Discussion and Insights for Future Hardware Architecture Design</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d8e0\">Building upon the identified hardware limitations and proposed solutions in specific application contexts, the paper broadens the discussion to offer forward-looking directions for future hardware architecture design:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Robustness Challenges:</strong> Addressing hardware failures and silent data corruption through advanced error detection and correction mechanisms for building non-stop AI infrastructure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CPU Bottlenecks and Interconnect Limitations:</strong> Optimizing CPU-accelerator collaboration, particularly breaking the limitations of traditional interfaces like PCIe for high-speed, bottleneck-free intra-node communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Intelligent Networks for AI:</strong> Creating low-latency and intelligent networks with technologies like co-packaged optics, lossless mechanisms, and adaptive routing to handle complex communication demands.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Memory Semantic Communication and Ordering:</strong> Resolving data consistency and ordering challenges in current memory semantic communication, exploring hardware-level built-in guarantees for improved communication efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Computation and Compression in the Network:</strong> Offloading computation and compression capabilities into the network, especially for specific workloads like EP, to unlock network bandwidth potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Memory-Centric Architecture Innovations:</strong> Addressing the memory bandwidth crisis driven by exponential model scaling, exploring cutting-edge technologies like DRAM stacking and wafer-scale integration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c6e6\">The paper delves into each of these areas with specific insights and recommendations, highlighting the need for a holistic co-design approach between hardware and software to enable the continued advancement and accessibility of large-scale AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d076\">In conclusion, this technical report provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions encountered during the development and training of DeepSeek-V3.

This latest iteration builds upon previous work by introducing an innovative recursive theorem-proving pipeline, leveraging the power of DeepSeek-V3 to generate its own high-quality initialization data. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving and is accompanied by the introduction of ProverBench, a new benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"09ca\">Pioneering Cold-Start Reasoning Data Generation</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"acb3\">A key innovation of DeepSeek-Prover-V2 lies in its unique cold-start training procedure. This process begins by prompting the powerful DeepSeek-V3 model to decompose complex mathematical theorems into a series of more manageable subgoals. Simultaneously, DeepSeek-V3 formalizes these high-level proof steps in Lean 4, effectively creating a structured sequence of sub-problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"aaf8\">To handle the computationally intensive proof search for each subgoal, the researchers employed a smaller 7B parameter model. Once all the decomposed steps of a challenging problem are successfully proven, the complete step-by-step formal proof is paired with DeepSeek-V3’s corresponding chain-of-thought reasoning. This ingenious approach allows the model to learn from a synthesized dataset that integrates both informal, high-level mathematical reasoning and rigorous formal proofs, providing a strong cold start for subsequent reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5fe8\">Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Reasoning</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7e36\">Building upon the synthetic cold-start data, the DeepSeek team curated a selection of challenging problems that the 7B prover model couldn’t solve end-to-end, but for which all subgoals had been successfully addressed. By combining the formal proofs of these subgoals, a complete proof for the original problem is constructed. This formal proof is then linked with DeepSeek-V3’s chain-of-thought outlining the lemma decomposition, creating a unified training example of informal reasoning followed by formalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"00ba\">The prover model is then fine-tuned on this synthetic data, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. This stage utilizes binary correct-or-incorrect feedback as the reward signal, further refining the model’s ability to bridge the gap between informal mathematical intuition and the precise construction of formal proofs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c968\">State-of-the-Art Performance</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f1d8\">The culmination of this innovative training process is DeepSeek-Prover-V2–671B, a model boasting 671 billion parameters. This model has achieved remarkable results, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving. It reached an impressive&nbsp;<strong>88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test</strong>&nbsp;and successfully solved&nbsp;<strong>49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench</strong>. The proofs generated by DeepSeek-Prover-V2 for the miniF2F dataset are publicly available for download, allowing for further scrutiny and analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A700/1%2AA4FJp063Twh0PPL5qxWlCQ.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d327\">Introducing ProverBench: A New Standard for Evaluation</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f746\">In addition to the model release, DeepSeek AI has introduced&nbsp;<strong>ProverBench</strong>, a new benchmark dataset comprising&nbsp;<strong>325 problems</strong>. This benchmark is designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities across different levels of difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7c01\">ProverBench includes&nbsp;<strong>15 problems formalized from recent AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) competitions (AIME 24 and 25)</strong>, providing authentic challenges at the high-school competition level. The remaining&nbsp;<strong>310 problems are drawn from curated textbook examples and educational tutorials</strong>, offering a diverse and pedagogically sound collection of formalized mathematical problems spanning various areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A220/1%2AtLIp5BCcMScgVl7jsZYusw.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"dfe3\">ProverBench aims to facilitate a more thorough assessment of neural theorem provers across both challenging competition problems and fundamental undergraduate-level mathematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"75e0\">Availability</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a6be\">DeepSeek AI is releasing DeepSeek-Prover-V2 in two model sizes to cater to different computational resources: a 7B parameter model and the larger 671B parameter model. DeepSeek-Prover-V2–671B is built upon the robust foundation of DeepSeek-V3-Base. The smaller DeepSeek-Prover-V2–7B is built upon DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base and features an extended context length of up to 32K tokens, allowing it to process longer and more complex reasoning sequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fe97\">The release of DeepSeek-Prover-V2 and the introduction of ProverBench mark a significant step forward in the field of neural theorem proving. By leveraging a recursive proof search pipeline and introducing a challenging new benchmark, DeepSeek AI is empowering the community to develop and evaluate more sophisticated and capable AI systems for formal mathematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ada\">Link：<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B</a></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/30/deepseek-unveils-deepseek-prover-v2-advancing-neural-theorem-proving-with-recursive-proof-search-and-a-new-benchmark/\">DeepSeek Unveils DeepSeek-Prover-V2: Advancing Neural Theorem Proving with Recursive Proof Search and a New Benchmark</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/30/deepseek-unveils-deepseek-prover-v2-advancing-neural-theorem-proving-with-recursive-proof-search-and-a-new-benchmark/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>21</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47162</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Can GRPO be 10x Efficient?

Recent community efforts have predominantly focused on mathematical reasoning, leaving the challenge of cross-domain generalization largely unexplored. Furthermore, standard Reinforcement Learning from Preference Optimization (GRPO) training is plagued by common issues such as performance bottlenecks, inefficient sample utilization, and difficulties in cultivating specialized reasoning skills when dealing with mixed-domain datasets. These challenges complicate the effective scaling of RL methods for LLMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing these limitations, researchers from the Kwaipilot team at Kuaishou have introduced a novel reinforcement learning framework: <strong>Two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO)</strong>. This innovative approach is designed to systematically tackle the aforementioned training challenges across multiple dimensions. The team has publicly released a technical report detailing the intricacies of their training method and has also open-sourced the <strong>SRPO-Qwen-32B</strong> model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, this work marks the <strong>first instance of achieving DeepSeek-R1-Zero-level performance concurrently in both mathematical and code domains</strong>. By leveraging the same base model as DeepSeek (Qwen2.5-32B) and employing a purely reinforcement learning training approach, SRPO has achieved impressive results on the AIME24 (50) and LiveCodeBench (41.6) benchmarks, surpassing the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more remarkably, SRPO achieves this level of performance with only <strong>one-tenth of the training steps</strong> required by R1-Zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZmEzMDA4M2RhYzZhNTc3YmU2N2NhMzMzNjI0YzYxMDlfYWFqQ3N3ZGN1MWF3UW5oYlE5SlVaNENhclF3WEtIZU5fVG9rZW46TFhJMGJXbEIzb0d4RU54VXBiS2MybHE3bnBmXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges with Vanilla GRPO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In their initial explorations, the Kwaipilot team experimented with the standard GRPO algorithm. However, they quickly encountered bottlenecks that prevented the model from reaching the desired R1-Zero performance levels. These issues included:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cross-Domain Optimization Conflicts (Math vs. Code):</strong> Mathematical problems tend to elicit longer and more detailed reasoning trajectories (Long CoT), while code data exhibits a weaker inclination towards this. Directly mixing these two data types led to conflicts, resulting in suboptimal performance in both domains.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced Training Efficiency due to Similar Group Rewards:</strong> The GRPO algorithm relies on the variance of non-zero rewards within a sampled group to calculate the advantage. When rollouts within a group yield nearly identical reward values, the calculated advantage approaches zero. If a significant portion of the training batch exhibits this phenomenon, effective gradient contributions become minimal, drastically reducing training efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Premature Performance Saturation:</strong> GRPO training encountered early performance plateaus and reward saturation on benchmark evaluations. This issue was partly attributed to insufficient data quality. When the training data lacks sufficient complexity or diversity, particularly with an abundance of simpler problems, the model tends to conservatively maintain its performance on easier tasks, hindering its ability to develop the complex and in-depth reasoning required for challenging problems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two-Staged Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the inherent response length conflicts between mathematical and code domains, the Kwaipilot team implemented a two-stage training paradigm:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stage 1: Eliciting Reasoning Abilities:</strong> This initial training phase focuses exclusively on challenging mathematical data. The primary goal is to fully incentivize the model&#8217;s test-time scaling, fostering capabilities such as reflective pausing, backtracking, and step-by-step decomposition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stage 2: Skill Integration:</strong> In this stage, code data is introduced into the training process. Building upon the reasoning foundation established in Stage 1, this phase aims to further enhance coding abilities while progressively strengthening procedural thinking, recursion, and tool-calling capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comparative Analysis of Training Strategies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of different training data strategies on response length was analyzed, revealing the following insights:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=YjAyZjA1MzIzY2ZmNjdiNjIzMTlkYjlkY2Q4OTQ5ZjZfUVR3R0FVNVByNEFTTElFN3JHeGxYMTZDRXRmY2x6NWVfVG9rZW46UGRURmJTcXdJb1R0emh4Q29XTmN6dFV1blZiXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mixed Training:</strong> Models trained on a mixture of math and code data showed limited growth in response length and poor benchmark performance. While math problems elicited some reasoning patterns, code problems often resulted in short, direct responses focused on immediate code output with minimal preliminary analysis or planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Math-Only Training:</strong> Training solely on mathematical data led to a stable increase in response length and excellent performance on math benchmarks. Crucially, it fostered strong and generalizable reasoning abilities; when faced with programming tasks, the model attempted detailed, step-by-step reasoning, including meticulous checking and revisiting steps in mathematical problem-solving.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Code-Only Training:</strong> While showing improved performance on code benchmarks, the development of explicit reasoning behavior was minimal, and achieving significant increases in response length proved difficult. Responses to both code and math problems were noticeably shorter compared to math-only training, with code solutions often being directly generated without substantial step-by-step reasoning or initial analysis.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staged Training:</strong> The two-stage training approach proposed by the Kwaipilot team yielded superior results in both mathematical and programming domains. The model consistently generated detailed step-by-step reasoning for math problems and structured reasoning patterns for programming tasks. Notably, complex behaviors emerged, such as the model spontaneously utilizing code to assist in mathematical reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History Resampling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team observed that during the mid-to-late stages of training, nearly 50% of the sampled groups within a batch produced identical rewards. This often occurred when the model consistently succeeded on easier problems, leading to minimal reward variance and ineffective gradient updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZWJjZjQ1ODExYzQzMjBjM2FlNWYwZThmYWQ3MTQ0MTRfcEpqYTlyMUZwTmhObG9PWHhQZmxVcVRnNnpwVzFNREpfVG9rZW46S0NLRmJ6dzdMb3NoakF4c3FFUmNZTFk1bkpoXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this inefficiency and improve the quality of the gradient signal, they introduced <strong>History Resampling</strong>. During training, they recorded the reward outcomes of all rollouts within each epoch. At the end of an epoch, they reconstructed the dataset for the next epoch based on the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Filtering Overly Simple Samples:</strong> Samples where all rollouts resulted in correct answers were excluded, as they provided no informative signal for policy improvement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retaining Informative Samples:</strong> Samples with diverse outcomes (both correct and incorrect) or all incorrect outcomes were retained. These samples generated positive reward variance, ensuring non-zero advantages and effective gradient signals. Furthermore, difficult samples where all rollouts were incorrect in the current epoch were also kept. The rationale is that these initially challenging problems might become relatively easier for the updated policy, thus generating effective gradients in subsequent training. This strategy aligns with the principle of curriculum learning, gradually exposing the model to increasingly challenging samples on average to enhance training efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Dynamic Sampling method proposed in DAPO, History Resampling significantly improved computational efficiency and resulted in more stable response length growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team performed meticulous data cleaning and filtering on publicly available Code&amp;Math datasets. They applied heuristic rules to filter out irrelevant URLs, formatting noise, and ensured the completeness of core fields (question and answer ground truth) in the original data. Following the data cleaning approach of PRIME for mathematical data, they removed multi-part questions, pure proof-based problems, and those requiring image or table understanding. For code data, they excluded problems dependent on specific environments, file I/O, or network interactions, focusing on algorithmic logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before data ingestion, they conducted correctness verification for both math and code problems to ensure the accuracy and solvability of the answers, discarding those with incorrect or ambiguous solutions. Subsequently, they assessed the difficulty of each problem, categorizing them into easy, medium, and hard levels based on their pass rate (Pass@k).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section details the experimental results obtained using the SRPO method. The Kwaipilot team focused on observing the changes in reward and metrics such as response length during training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training Process</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=Y2JhZWNhNTc4YzkxYTFkOWU3NTE4ZDE4YjM5Zjk5ODZfVHpQdjJKcFdEdVltOG1taExMblRHaERzWUhPV0U2a3lfVG9rZW46U3FCU2JrSFBob2ZyeDJ4UXVCYWNhZE9sbjVlXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The figure above illustrates the complete reward curve and response length curve during SRPO training. After the initial reward growth began to plateau, the training transitioned into the second stage. At the beginning of the second stage, the overall reward decreased due to the model&#8217;s prior lack of training on code, followed by a steady increase in reward during subsequent training. Integrating code data did not significantly increase the response length, which aligned with their expectations. <strong>Simultaneously, benchmark results indicated a continuous and stable improvement in both the mathematical and coding abilities of the model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new method.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, History Resampling ensured that gradient updates remained effective at each training step, directly increasing the proportion of informative gradients. This enhanced sampling efficiency led to stable reward growth, clearly showcasing the improved training efficiency achieved by the resampling strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reasoning Behaviors</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team identified three representative reflective patterns: recheck, hesitation, and exploration. They statistically analyzed responses containing these patterns and recorded the average response length for each. During RL training, they observed a gradual increase in the frequency of the model&#8217;s self-reflection, correction, and backtracking, indicating the emergence of a &#8220;self-verification&#8221; ability. They posit that the emergence of &#8220;reflection,&#8221; akin to human cognitive processes, in the model during RL is an adaptive behavior resulting from the policy optimization process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MjI3NzQ1ZmQxNzk3OTU2NDNjYjFiNWFhMzBkMGY2MzhfVHhrNVV5TG1ERkxoSjFFVzJBOWMwazU4STRHZXlVNk5fVG9rZW46UXN1emJ6UnVSbzRCYjV4cjBJZmNxYTI2bmhlXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As shown in the figure above, the model exhibited almost no proactive checking and reflection of previous reasoning steps in the early stages of training. However, as training progressed, the model displayed significant reflective and backtracking behaviors, forming response patterns such as step-by-step reasoning, numerical substitution, step-by-step verification, and self-optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZDk1MjJmNmVjOTJhNWY0NGJjOGQ2NTUyZTZlNTdmNzFfWWc1V2RudHdXTUZIUWJVVUsxRmNMaDBxS25sY2hTY3lfVG9rZW46RmJxMWJFcndYb2V1Zk54dU5iTGNVWUJFblFmXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, they also discovered that the model learned to spontaneously use program code for verification when solving mathematical problems. It would first provide a solution process through mathematical reasoning and then proactively write program code to verify the correctness of the solution. These instances demonstrated the model&#8217;s ability to leverage procedural thinking for self-correction and multiple attempts, further indicating that in the later stages of training, the model had mastered broad thinking and the integrated application of various code-based reasoning approaches for problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Paper SRPO: A Cross-Domain Implementation of Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on LLM is on </strong><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14286\">arXiv</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try with the SRPO-Qwen-32B</strong> <strong>Model on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14286\">HuggingFace</a></strong></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/23/can-grpo-be-10x-efficient-kwai-ais-srpo-suggests-yes-with-srpo/\">Can GRPO be 10x Efficient?

Simultaneously, the company has hinted at the imminent arrival of its next-generation model, R2, building anticipation within the AI community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper, titled &#8220;<em>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</em>&#8221; introduces a novel method that allows GRMs to optimize reward generation by dynamically producing principles and critiques. This is achieved through rejection fine-tuning and rule-based online reinforcement learning [1-1].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development comes at a time when the paradigm for scaling LLMs is shifting from the pre-training stage to post-training, particularly the inference phase, following the emergence of models like OpenAI&#8217;s o1. This approach leverages increased reinforcement learning (computational effort during training) and more extensive &#8220;thinking time&#8221; (computational effort during testing) to continually improve model performance. Notably, o1 generates a lengthy internal chain of thought before responding to users, refining its reasoning process, exploring different strategies, and identifying its own errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek&#8217;s own R1 series of models has further validated the potential of pure reinforcement learning training (without relying on supervised fine-tuning) to achieve significant leaps in LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental &#8220;next token prediction&#8221; mechanism of LLMs, while providing vast knowledge, often lacks deep planning and the ability to predict long-term outcomes, making them susceptible to short-sighted decisions. Reinforcement learning serves as a crucial complement, providing LLMs with an &#8220;Internal World Model.&#8221; This enables them to simulate the potential outcomes of different reasoning paths, evaluate the quality of these paths, and select superior solutions, ultimately leading to more systematic long-term planning. The synergy between LLMs and RL is increasingly recognized as key to enhancing the ability to solve complex problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wu Yi, an assistant professor at Tsinghua&#8217;s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), likened the relationship between LLMs and reinforcement learning to a &#8220;multiplicative relationship&#8221; in a recent podcast. While reinforcement learning excels in decision-making, it inherently lacks understanding. The construction of understanding relies on pre-trained models, upon which reinforcement learning can then further optimize decision-making capabilities. This &#8220;multiplicative relationship&#8221; suggests that only when a strong foundation of understanding, memory, and logical reasoning is built during pre-training can reinforcement learning fully unlock its potential to create a complete intelligent agent [1-2].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive survey paper titled &#8220;Reinforcement Learning Enhanced LLMs: A Survey&#8221; outlines the typical three-step process of using RL to train LLMs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reward Model Training:</strong> Before fine-tuning, a reward model (or reward function) is trained to approximate human preferences and evaluate different LLM outputs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Preference-Based Fine-Tuning:</strong> In each fine-tuning iteration, the large language model generates multiple responses to a given instruction, and each response is scored using the trained reward model.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Policy </strong><strong>Optimization</strong><strong>:</strong> Reinforcement learning optimization techniques are used to update the model&#8217;s weights based on the preference scores, aiming to improve response generation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating reinforcement learning allows large language models to dynamically adjust based on varying preference scores, moving beyond the limitations of a single, pre-determined answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DeepSeek&#8217;s SPCT: Addressing the Scaling Challenges of </strong><strong>RL</strong><strong> for </strong><strong>LLMs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning in post-training as a breakthrough for enhancing LLM performance, reinforcement learning algorithms themselves still have significant room for improvement, and the &#8220;Scaling Laws&#8221; of reinforcement learning are still in their nascent stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional scaling laws that focus on increasing data and compute to improve model performance, the scaling laws for reinforcement learning are influenced by more complex factors, including sample throughput, model parameter size, and the complexity of the training environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major hurdle in the scaling of reinforcement learning is reward sparsity. The reward model is a critical component, and generating accurate reward signals is paramount. Achieving both generalization and continuity in reward models is a key focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek and Tsinghua researchers addressed this challenge in their recent work by exploring the scalability and generalization of reward models at inference time. Their proposed Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) method aims to improve the scalability of general reward modeling during inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPCT approach involves two key stages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Rejection Fine-Tuning:</strong> This serves as a cold start, enabling the GRM to adapt to generating principles and critiques in the correct format and type.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rule-Based Online RL:</strong> This stage further optimizes the generation of principles and critiques.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve effective inference-time scaling, the researchers employed parallel sampling to maximize computational utilization. By sampling multiple times, the DeepSeek-GRM can generate different sets of principles and critiques and select the final reward through voting. Furthermore, a meta-reward model (Meta RM) is trained to guide the voting process, further enhancing scaling performance. The Meta RM is a point-to-point scalar reward model designed to identify the correctness of the principles and critiques generated by the DeepSeek-GRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experimental results demonstrated that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models on multiple comprehensive RM benchmarks without significant domain bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead: DeepSeek R2 on the Horizon</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the research paper focuses on advancements in reward modeling and inference-time scaling, the mention of DeepSeek&#8217;s R1 series and the implicit progression suggests that the company is actively developing its next-generation model, R2. Given DeepSeek&#8217;s emphasis on pure reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning, it is highly anticipated that R2 will incorporate and build upon the insights gained from this latest research on scalable reward models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI community will be keenly watching for further announcements regarding DeepSeek R2, eager to see how the company leverages its innovative approaches to reinforcement learning and inference optimization to push the boundaries of large language model capabilities. The focus on scalable reward models hints at a potential emphasis on even more sophisticated self-evaluation and improvement mechanisms within their next flagship model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper <em>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</em> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495\" title=\"\">arXiv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/11/deepseek-signals-next-gen-r2-model-unveils-novel-approach-to-scaling-inference-with-spct/\">DeepSeek Signals Next-Gen R2 Model, Unveils Novel Approach to Scaling Inference with SPCT</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/11/deepseek-signals-next-gen-r2-model-unveils-novel-approach-to-scaling-inference-with-spct/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>12</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47130</post-id>\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>"

Identifying Bowser as he plays among the other canines is easy for the dog-owner to do while onsite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if someone wants to use a generative AI model like GPT-5 to monitor their pet while they are at work, the model could fail at this basic task. Vision-language models like GPT-5 often excel at recognizing general objects, like a dog, but they perform poorly at locating personalized objects, like Bowser the French Bulldog.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this shortcoming, researchers from MIT and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab have introduced a new training method that teaches vision-language models to localize personalized objects in a scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their method uses carefully prepared video-tracking data in which the same object is tracked across multiple frames. They designed the dataset so the model must focus on contextual clues to identify the personalized object, rather than relying on knowledge it previously memorized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When given a few example images showing a personalized object, like someone’s pet, the retrained model is better able to identify the location of that same pet in a new image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Models retrained with their method outperformed state-of-the-art systems at this task. Importantly, their technique leaves the rest of the model’s general abilities intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new approach could help future AI systems track specific objects across time, like a child’s backpack, or localize objects of interest, such as a species of animal in ecological monitoring. It could also aid in the development of AI-driven assistive technologies that help visually impaired users find certain items in a room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, we want these models to be able to learn from context, just like humans do. If a model can do this well, rather than retraining it for each new task, we could just provide a few examples and it would infer how to perform the task from that context. This is a very powerful ability,” says Jehanzeb Mirza, an MIT postdoc and senior author of a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13317\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper on this technique&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirza is joined on the paper by co-lead authors Sivan Doveh, a graduate student at Weizmann Institute of Science; and Nimrod Shabtay, a researcher at IBM Research; James Glass, a senior research scientist and the head of the Spoken Language Systems Group in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and others. The work will be presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unexpected shortcoming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have found that large language models (LLMs) can excel at learning from context. If they feed an LLM a few examples of a task, like addition problems, it can learn to answer new addition problems based on the context that has been provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vision-language model (VLM) is essentially an LLM with a visual component connected to it, so the MIT researchers thought it would inherit the LLM’s in-context learning capabilities. But this is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The research community has not been able to find a black-and-white answer to this particular problem yet. The bottleneck could arise from the fact that some visual information is lost in the process of merging the two components together, but we just don’t know,” Mirza says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to improve VLMs abilities to do in-context localization, which involves finding a specific object in a new image. They focused on the data used to retrain existing VLMs for a new task, a process called fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical fine-tuning data are gathered from random sources and depict collections of everyday objects. One image might contain cars parked on a street, while another includes a bouquet of flowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no real coherence in these data, so the model never learns to recognize the same object in multiple images,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fix this problem, the researchers developed a new dataset by curating samples from existing video-tracking data. These data are video clips showing the same object moving through a scene, like a tiger walking across a grassland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cut frames from these videos and structured the dataset so each input would consist of multiple images showing the same object in different contexts, with example questions and answers about its location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By using multiple images of the same object in different contexts, we encourage the model to consistently localize that object of interest by focusing on the context,” Mirza explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forcing the focus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the researchers found that VLMs tend to cheat. Instead of answering based on context clues, they will identify the object using knowledge gained during pretraining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, since the model already learned that an image of a tiger and the label “tiger” are correlated, it could identify the tiger crossing the grassland based on this pretrained knowledge, instead of inferring from context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this problem, the researchers used pseudo-names rather than actual object category names in the dataset. In this case, they changed the name of the tiger to “Charlie.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It took us a while to figure out how to prevent the model from cheating. But we changed the game for the model. The model does not know that ‘Charlie’ can be a tiger, so it is forced to look at the context,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also faced challenges in finding the best way to prepare the data. If the frames are too close together, the background would not change enough to provide data diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, finetuning VLMs with this new dataset improved accuracy at personalized localization by about 12 percent on average. When they included the dataset with pseudo-names, the performance gains reached 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As model size increases, their technique leads to greater performance gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to study possible reasons VLMs don’t inherit in-context learning capabilities from their base LLMs. In addition, they plan to explore additional mechanisms to improve the performance of a VLM without the need to retrain it with new data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work reframes few-shot personalized object localization — adapting on the fly to the same object across new scenes — as an instruction-tuning problem and uses video-tracking sequences to teach VLMs to localize based on visual context rather than class priors. It also introduces the first benchmark for this setting with solid gains across open and proprietary VLMs. Given the immense significance of quick, instance-specific grounding — often without finetuning — for users of real-world workflows (such as robotics, augmented reality assistants, creative tools, etc.), the practical, data-centric recipe offered by this work can help enhance the widespread adoption of vision-language foundation models,” says Saurav Jha, a postdoc at the Mila-Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, who was not involved with this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional co-authors are Wei Lin, a research associate at Johannes Kepler University; Eli Schwartz, a research scientist at IBM Research; Hilde Kuehne, professor of computer science at&amp;nbsp;Tuebingen AI Center and an affiliated professor at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab; Raja Giryes, an associate professor at Tel Aviv University; Rogerio Feris, a principal scientist and manager at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab; Leonid Karlinsky, a principal research scientist at IBM Research; Assaf Arbelle, a senior research scientist at IBM Research; and Shimon Ullman, the Samy and Ruth Cohn Professor of Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-VLM-local-01-press.jpg?itok=I38AF21h\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new training method teaches vision-language generative AI models to localize a personalized object, like a cat named Snoofkin, in a new scene.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/video\">Video</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab\">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Remembering Professor Emerita Jeanne Shapiro  Bamberger, a pioneer in music education</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/remembering-professor-emerita-jeanne-shapiro-bamberger-1015</link>\n  <description>The former department chair was an early innovator in the use of artificial intelligence to both study and influence how children learn music.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:25:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/remembering-professor-emerita-jeanne-shapiro-bamberger-1015</guid>\n        <dc:creator>MIT Music and Theater Arts</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts fondly remembers the legacy of Professor Emerita Jeanne Shapiro&amp;nbsp;Bamberger, who passed away peacefully at home in Berkeley, California, of natural causes on Dec. 12, 2024 at the age of 100.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three decades at the Institute, Bamberger found ways to use computers to engage students and help them learn music. A trained pianist who became fascinated with the idea of using technology to gain insights into music education, Bamberger ultimately helped to change how music was taught at MIT and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bamberger was born on Feb. 11, 1924 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her mother, Gertrude Shapiro (nee Kulberg), from a Romanian Jewish family, studied child psychology and was active in the League of Women Voters. Her father, Morse Shapiro, of Lithuanian and Polish Jewish heritage, was a groundbreaking pediatric cardiologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1969, Bamberger began her 32-year career at MIT, initially in the former MIT Education Department. While at MIT, Bamberger became the first woman to earn tenure in the Music and Theater Arts Section. She was know for pioneering the use of computer languages to teach children to learn music. She also used her computer innovations to study how children — and by extension, all humans — learn music, and this vector in particular became her life's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of her time, Bamberger worked in the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab in the 1980s and developed computer languages (MusicLogo and Impromptu) while at the MIT Division for Study and Research in Education from 1975 to 1995. She became associate professor in music and theater arts in 1981, earned tenure soon thereafter, and chaired the department in 1989-90. During this period, she continued to perform as a concert pianist, taking part in concerts with the MIT Symphony Orchestra, and actively playing chamber music both at MIT and in the community. She also taught at the Harvard University Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Institute Professor Marcus Thompson recollects, “During her time with us as a senior professor she was clearly a jewel in the crown. For someone who had studied piano with an historic legend in Artur Schnabel, who had studied with and known at least one of the French Six, Darius Milhaud, and worked with French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez, she was among that group of our professors who continually advocated for a new music building, considered the possibility of a graduate program in music at a time when we were being pushed to grow, at a time when she was our only senior woman when the need to do better was finally seen.” Both the &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/seen-heard-edward-joyce-linde-music-building-1205\"&gt;dedicated music building&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-mit-music-technology-computation-graduate-program-0927\"&gt;graduate music program&lt;/a&gt; are now a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bamberger loved her work and was beloved and admired by her students and colleagues. Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor Evan Ziporyn shares that she “was very much a shaping presence for our section — MIT Music and Theater Arts wouldn't be what we are today without her contributions. She’s also just a very cool person — I mean, how many 90-year-old academics end up working with Herbie Hancock and taking their research to the White House?”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziporyn adds that “among 7 million other singular accomplishments,” Bamberger published numerous articles and books&amp;nbsp;including&amp;nbsp;“The Art of Listening”&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;with Howard Brofsky,&amp;nbsp;“The Mind Behind the Musical Ear,”&amp;nbsp;“Developing&amp;nbsp;Musical Intuitions,” and&amp;nbsp;“Discovering the Musical&amp;nbsp;Mind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at MIT, Bamberger took many students under her wing and assisted many more with their academic careers. Elaine Chew SM ’98, PhD ’00, an operations researcher, pianist, current professor of engineering at King’s College London, and mentee of Bamberger, says, “I would not be doing what I am today if not for Jeanne. A child prodigy turned music philosopher, Jeanne was a pioneer in music and AI long before it was fashionable. She was deeply interested in people and passionate about how we learn. I will not forget the day when I came to her with complaints about things not working. Rather than telling me what to do, Jeanne said, ‘What are you going to do about it?’ prompting me to reflect on and develop my own sense of agency.” (Chew speaks more on Bamberger’s inspirational role in a &lt;a href=\"https://elainechew-research.blogspot.com/2016/06/qmul-people-profile.html\"&gt;2016 interview&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All told, Bamberger had a creative, fertile mind and loved to ask probing questions, a quality she passed to her progeny and community — it was her excitement and her passion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a professor at MIT, Bamberger was a force to be reckoned with. In addition to her long and productive academic career — in which she published four books and nearly 20 book chapters — she was politically active and supported the anti-Vietnam war and the civil rights movements. She continued teaching and publishing&amp;nbsp;her work well into her 90s and had a strong community of companions and colleagues to the end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Bamberger became professor emerita at MIT and moved to Berkeley, California, continuing to teach in the Music Department at the University of California at Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 100, she was predeceased by her former husband, Frank K. Bamberger. She is survived by her two sons, Joshua and Paul (Chip); four grandchildren — Jerehme, Kaela, Eli, and Noah; and many caring relatives and friends.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-jeanne-shapiro-bamberger-obit.jpg?itok=utQUy47f\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Jeanne Shapiro Bamberger at 100</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Elaine Chew</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/obituaries\">Obituaries</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music-and-theater-arts\">Music and theater arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music\">Music technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music2\">Music</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/arts\">Arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/history-mit\">History of MIT</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/education\">Education, teaching, academics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Blending neuroscience, AI, and music to create mental health innovations</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/kimaya-lecamwasam-blending-neuroscience-ai-music-to-create-mental-health-innovations-1015</link>\n  <description>Media Lab PhD student Kimaya Lecamwasam researches how music can shape well-being.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 13:20:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/kimaya-lecamwasam-blending-neuroscience-ai-music-to-create-mental-health-innovations-1015</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Stefanie Koperniak | Office of Graduate Education</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Computational neuroscientist and singer/songwriter Kimaya (Kimy) Lecamwasam, who also plays electric bass and guitar, says music has been a core part of her life for as long as she can remember. She grew up in a musical family and played in bands all through high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of my life, writing and playing music was the clearest way I had to express myself,” says Lecamwasam. “I was a really shy and anxious kid, and I struggled with speaking up for myself. Over time, composing and performing music became central to both how I communicated and to how I managed my own mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with equipping her with valuable skills and experiences, she credits her passion for music as the catalyst for her interest in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got to see firsthand not only the ways that audiences reacted to music, but also how much value music had for musicians,” she says. “That close connection between making music and feeling well is what first pushed me to ask why music has such a powerful hold on us, and eventually led me to study the science behind it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lecamwasam earned a bachelor’s degree in 2021 from Wellesley College, where she studied neuroscience — specifically in the Systems and Computational Neuroscience track — and also music. During her first semester, she took a class in songwriting that she says made her more aware of the connections between music and emotions. While studying at Wellesley, she participated in the MIT Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program for three years. Working in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences lab of Emery Brown, the Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and Computational Neuroscience, she focused primarily on classifying consciousness in anesthetized patients and training brain-computer interface-enabled prosthetics using reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I still had a really deep love for music, which I was pursuing in parallel to all of my neuroscience work, but I really wanted to try to find a way to combine both of those things in grad school,” says Lecamwasam. Brown recommended that she look into the graduate programs at the MIT Media Lab within the Program in Media Arts and Sciences (MAS), which turned out to be an ideal fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One thing I really love about where I am is that I get to be both an artist and a scientist,” says Lecamwasam. “That was something that was important to me when I was picking a graduate program. I wanted to make sure that I was going to be able to do work that was really rigorous, validated, and important, but also get to do cool, creative explorations and actually put the research that I was doing into practice in different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring the physical, mental, and emotional impacts of music&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Informed by her years of neuroscience research as an undergraduate and her passion for music, Lecamwasam focused her graduate research on harnessing the emotional potency of music into scalable, non-pharmacological mental health tools. Her master’s thesis focused on “pharmamusicology,” looking at how music might positively affect the physiology and psychology of those with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overarching theme of Lecamwasam’s research is exploring the various impacts of&amp;nbsp;music and affective computing — physically, mentally, and emotionally.&amp;nbsp;Now in the third year of her doctoral program in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/opera-of-the-future/overview/\"&gt;Opera of the Future&lt;/a&gt; group, she is currently investigating the impact of large-scale live music and concert experiences on the mental health and well-being of both audience members and performers. She is also working to clinically validate music listening, composition, and performance as health interventions, in combination with psychotherapy and pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her recent work, in collaboration with Professor Anna Huang’s Human-AI Resonance Lab, assesses the emotional resonance of AI-generated music compared to human-composed music;&amp;nbsp;the aim is to identify more ethical applications of emotion-sensitive music generation and recommendation that preserve human creativity and agency, and can also be used as health interventions. She has co-led a wellness and music workshop at the Wellbeing Summit in Bilbao, Spain, and has presented her work at the 2023 CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Hamburg, Germany and the 2024 Audio Mostly conference in Milan, Italy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lecamwasam&amp;nbsp;has collaborated with organizations near and far to implement real-world applications of her research. She worked with Carnegie Hall's Weill Music Institute on its Well-Being Concerts and is currently partnering on a study assessing the impact of lullaby writing on perinatal health with the North Shore Lullaby Project in Massachusetts, an offshoot of Carnegie Hall’s Lullaby Project. Her main international collaboration is with a company called Myndstream, working on projects comparing the emotional resonance of AI-generated music to human-composed music and thinking of clinical and real-world applications. She is also working on a project with the companies PixMob and Empatica (an MIT Media Lab spinoff), centered on assessing the impact of interactive lighting and large-scale live music experiences on emotional resonance in stadium and arena settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kimy combines a deep love for — and sophisticated knowledge of — music with scientific curiosity and rigor in ways that represent the Media Lab/MAS spirit at its best,” says Professor Tod Machover, Lecamwasam’s research advisor, Media Lab faculty director, and director of the Opera of the Future group. “She has long believed that music is one of the most powerful and effective ways to create personalized interventions to help stabilize emotional distress and promote empathy and connection. It is this same desire to establish sane, safe, and sustaining environments for work and play that has led Kimy to become one of the most effective and devoted community-builders at the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lecamwasam has participated in the SOS (Students Offering Support) program in MAS for a few years, which assists students from a variety of life experiences and backgrounds during the process of applying to the Program in Media Arts and Sciences. She will soon be the first MAS peer mentor as part of a new initiative through which she will establish and coordinate programs including a “buddy system,” pairing incoming master’s students with PhD students as a way to help them transition into graduate student life at MIT. She is also part of the Media Lab’s Studcom, a student-run organization that promotes, facilitates, and creates experiences meant to bring the community together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think everything that I have gotten to do has been so supported by the friends I’ve made in my lab and department, as well as across departments,” says Lecamwasam. “I think everyone is just really excited about the work that they do and so supportive of one another. It makes it so that even when things are challenging or difficult, I’m motivated to do this work and be a part of this community.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-Kimaya-Lecamwasam.jpg?itok=zYZq49e0\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">As a musician, Kimaya Lecamwasam says, “that close connection between making music and feeling well is what first pushed me to ask why music has such a powerful hold on us, and eventually led me to study the science behind it.”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Gretchen Ertl</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/profile\">Profile</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/students\">Students</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/graduate\">Graduate, postdoctoral</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/neuroscience\">Neuroscience</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music2\">Music</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mental-health\">Mental health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/brain-cognitive\">Brain and cognitive sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music-and-theater-arts\">Music and theater arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/media-lab-0\">Media Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/urop\">Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Optimizing food subsidies: Applying digital platforms to maximize nutrition</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/optimizing-food-subsidies-applying-digital-platforms-maximize-nutrition-1014</link>\n  <description>An algorithm can change the face of food assistance policy in the Global South, says MIT assistant professor and J-WAFS researcher Ali Aouad.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:40:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/optimizing-food-subsidies-applying-digital-platforms-maximize-nutrition-1014</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Mia Jeffries | Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oct. 16 is World Food Day, a global campaign to celebrate the founding of the Food and Agriculture Organization 80 years ago, and to work toward a healthy, sustainable, food-secure future. More than &lt;a href=\"https://www.fao.org/world-food-day/about/en\"&gt;670 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the world are facing hunger. Millions of others are facing rising obesity rates and struggle to get healthy food for proper nutrition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;World Food Day calls on not only world governments, but business, academia, the media, and even the youth to take action to promote resilient food systems and combat hunger. This year, the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Laboratory (J-WAFS) is spotlighting an MIT researcher who is working toward this goal by studying food and water systems in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J-WAFS seed grants provide funding to early-stage research projects that are unique to prior work. In an 11th round of seed grant funding in 2025, 10 MIT faculty members received support to carry out their cutting-edge water and food research. Ali Aouad PhD ’17, assistant professor of operations management at the MIT Sloan School of Management, was one of those grantees. “I had searched before joining MIT what kind of research centers and initiatives were available that tried to coalesce research on food systems,” Aouad says. “And so, I was very excited about J-WAFS.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aouad gathered more information about J-WAFS at the new faculty orientation session in August 2024, where he spoke to J-WAFS staff and learned about the program’s grant opportunities for water and food research. Later that fall semester, he attended a few J-WAFS seminars on agricultural economics and water resource management. That’s when Aouad knew that his project was perfectly aligned with the J-WAFS mission of securing humankind’s water and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aouad’s seed project focuses on food subsidies. With a background in operations research and an interest in digital platforms, much of his work has centered on aligning supply-side operations with heterogeneous customer preferences. Past projects include ones on retail and matching systems. “I started thinking that these types of demand-driven approaches may be also very relevant to important social challenges, particularly as they relate to food security,” Aouad says. Before starting his PhD at MIT, Aouad worked on projects that looked at subsidies for smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries. “I think in the back of my mind, I've always been fascinated by trying to solve these issues,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His seed grant project, &lt;a href=\"https://jwafs.mit.edu/projects/2025/optimal-subsidy-design-application-food-assistance-programs\"&gt;Optimal subsidy design: Application to food assistance programs&lt;/a&gt;, aims to leverage data on preferences and purchasing habits from local grocery stores in India to inform food assistance policy and optimize the design of subsidies. Typical data collection systems, like point-of-sales, are not as readily available in India’s local groceries, making this type of data hard to come by for low-income individuals. “Mom-and-pop stores are extremely important last-mile operators when it comes to nutrition,” he explains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this project, the research team gave local grocers point-of-sale scanners to track purchasing habits. “We aim to develop an algorithm that converts these transactions into some sort of ‘revelation’ of the individuals’ latent preferences,” says Aouad. “As such, we can model and optimize the food assistance programs — how much variety and flexibility is offered, taking into account the expected demand uptake.” He continues, “now, of course, our ability to answer detailed design questions [across various products and prices] depends on the quality of our inference from&amp;nbsp; the data, and so this is where we need more sophisticated and robust algorithms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the data collection and model development, the &lt;a name=\"_Int_3uYfZLJV\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;ultimate goal of this research is to inform policy surrounding food assistance programs through an “optimization approach.” Aouad describes the complexities of using optimization to guide policy. “Policies are often informed by domain expertise, legacy systems, or political deliberation. A lot of researchers build rigorous evidence to inform food policy, but it’s fair to say that the kind of approach that I’m proposing in this research is not something that is commonly used. I see an opportunity for bringing a new approach and methodological tradition to a problem that has been central for policy for many decades.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall health of consumers is the reason food assistance programs exist, yet measuring long-term nutritional impacts and shifts in purchase behavior is difficult. In past research, Aouad notes that the short-term effects of food assistance interventions can be significant. However, these effects are often short-lived. “This is a fascinating question that I don’t think we will be able to address within the space of interventions that we will be considering. However, I think it is something I would like to capture in the research, and maybe develop hypotheses for future work around how we can shift nutrition-related behaviors in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his project develops a new methodology to calibrate food assistance programs, large-scale applications are not promised. “A lot of what drives subsidy mechanisms and food assistance programs is also, quite frankly, how easy it is and how cost-effective it is to implement these policies in the first place,” comments Aouad. Cost and infrastructure barriers are unavoidable to this kind of policy research, as well as sustaining these programs. Aouad’s effort will provide insights into customer preferences and subsidy optimization in a pilot setup, but replicating this approach on a real scale may be costly. Aouad hopes to be able to gather proxy information from customers that would both feed into the model and provide insight into a more cost-effective way to collect data for large-scale implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is still much work to be done to ensure food security for all, whether it’s advances in agriculture, food-assistance programs, or ways to boost adequate nutrition.

Artificial intelligence is helping with the former, with tools that comb through catalogs of materials to quickly tag promising candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once a material is made, verifying its quality still involves scanning it with specialized instruments to validate its performance — an expensive and time-consuming step that can hold up the development and distribution of new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a new AI tool developed by MIT engineers could help clear the quality-control bottleneck, offering a faster and cheaper option for certain materials-driven industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href=\"https://www.cell.com/matter/abstract/S2590-2385(25)00477-1\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study appearing today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Matter&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers present “SpectroGen,” a generative AI tool that turbocharges scanning capabilities by serving as a virtual spectrometer. The tool takes in “spectra,” or measurements of a material in one scanning modality, such as infrared, and generates what that material’s spectra would look like if it were&amp;nbsp;scanned in an entirely different modality, such as X-ray. The AI-generated spectral results match, with 99 percent accuracy, the results obtained from physically scanning the material with the new instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain spectroscopic modalities reveal specific properties in a material: Infrared reveals a material’s molecular groups, while X-ray diffraction visualizes the material’s crystal structures, and Raman scattering illuminates a material’s molecular vibrations. Each of these properties is essential in gauging a material’s quality and typically requires tedious workflows on multiple expensive and distinct instruments to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With SpectroGen, the researchers envision that a diversity of measurements can be made using a single and cheaper physical scope. For instance, a manufacturing line could carry out quality control of materials by scanning them with a single infrared camera. Those infrared spectra could then be fed into SpectroGen to automatically generate the material’s X-ray spectra, without the factory having to house and operate a separate, often more expensive X-ray-scanning laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new AI tool generates spectra in less than one minute, a thousand times faster compared to traditional approaches that can take several hours to days to measure and validate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think that you don’t have to do the physical measurements in all the modalities you need, but perhaps just in a single, simple, and cheap modality,” says study co-author Loza Tadesse, assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “Then you can use SpectroGen to generate the rest. And this could improve productivity, efficiency, and quality of manufacturing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s lead author is former MIT postdoc Yanmin Zhu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond bonds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tadesse’s interdisciplinary group at MIT pioneers technologies that advance human and planetary health, developing innovations for applications ranging from rapid disease diagnostics to sustainable agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diagnosing diseases, and material analysis in general, usually involves scanning samples and collecting spectra in different modalities, with different instruments that are bulky and expensive and that you might not all find in one lab,” Tadesse says. “So, we were brainstorming about how to miniaturize all this equipment and how to streamline the experimental pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhu noted the increasing use of generative AI tools for discovering new materials and drug candidates, and wondered whether AI could also be harnessed to generate spectral data. In other words, could AI act as a virtual spectrometer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spectroscope probes a material’s properties by sending light of a certain wavelength into the material. That light causes molecular bonds in the material to vibrate in ways that scatter the light back out to the scope, where the light is recorded as a pattern of waves, or spectra, that can then be read as a signature of the material’s structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For AI to generate spectral data, the conventional approach would involve training an algorithm to recognize connections between physical atoms and features in a material, and the spectra they produce. Given the complexity of molecular structures within just one material, Tadesse says such an approach can quickly become intractable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing this even for just one material is impossible,” she says. “So, we thought, is there another way to interpret spectra?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found an answer with math. They realized that a spectral pattern, which is a sequence of waveforms, can be represented mathematically. For instance, a spectrum that contains a series of bell curves is known as a “Gaussian” distribution, which is associated with a certain mathematical expression, compared to a series of narrower waves, known as a “Lorentzian” distribution, that is described by a separate, distinct algorithm. And as it turns out, for most materials infrared spectra characteristically contain more Lorentzian waveforms, while Raman spectra are more Gaussian, and X-ray spectra is a mix of the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tadesse and Zhu worked this mathematical interpretation of spectral data into an algorithm that they then incorporated into a generative AI model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;It’s a physics-savvy generative AI that understands what spectra are,” Tadesse says. “And the key novelty is, we interpreted spectra not as how it comes about from chemicals and bonds, but that it is actually math — curves and graphs, which an AI tool can understand and interpret.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data co-pilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team demonstrated their SpectroGen AI tool on a large, publicly available dataset of over 6,000 mineral samples. Each sample includes information on the mineral’s properties, such as its elemental composition and crystal structure. Many samples in the dataset also include spectral data in different modalities, such as X-ray, Raman, and infrared. Of these samples, the team fed several hundred to SpectroGen, in a process that trained the AI tool, also known as a neural network, to learn correlations between a mineral’s different spectral modalities. This training enabled SpectroGen to take in spectra of a material in one modality, such as in infrared, and generate what a spectra in a totally different modality, such as X-ray, should look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they trained the AI tool, the researchers fed SpectroGen spectra from a mineral in the dataset that was not included in the training process. They asked the tool to generate a spectra in a different modality, based on this “new” spectra. The AI-generated spectra, they found, was a close match to the mineral’s real spectra, which was originally recorded by a physical instrument. The researchers carried out similar tests with a number of other minerals and found that the AI tool quickly generated spectra, with 99 percent correlation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can feed spectral data into the network and can get another totally different kind of spectral data, with very high accuracy, in less than a minute,” Zhu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team says that SpectroGen can generate spectra for any type of mineral. In a manufacturing setting, for instance, mineral-based materials that are used to make semiconductors and battery technologies could first be quickly scanned by an infrared laser. The spectra from this infrared scanning could be fed into SpectroGen, which would then generate a spectra in X-ray, which operators or a multiagent AI platform can check to assess the material’s quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think of it as having an agent or co-pilot, supporting researchers, technicians, pipelines and industry,” Tadesse says. “We plan to customize this for different industries’ needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team is exploring ways to adapt the AI tool for disease diagnostics, and for agricultural monitoring through an upcoming project funded by Google. Tadesse is also advancing the technology to the field through a new startup and envisions making SpectroGen available for a wide range of sectors, from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors to defense.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-SpectroGen-01-press.jpg?itok=W588Pvu1\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The circle with the chip symbolizes SpectroGen, with the connecting threads depicting the process of generating a material’s spectrum. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: Courtesy of the researchers</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/imaging\">Imaging</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/light\">Light</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/manufacturing\">Manufacturing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/materialsscienceandengineering\">Materials science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Helping scientists run complex data analyses without writing code</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/helping-scientists-run-complex-data-analyses-without-writing-code-1014</link>\n  <description>Co-founded by an MIT alumnus, Watershed Bio offers researchers who aren’t software engineers a way to run large-scale analyses to accelerate biology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 10:15:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/helping-scientists-run-complex-data-analyses-without-writing-code-1014</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As costs for diagnostic and sequencing technologies have plummeted in recent years, researchers have collected an unprecedented amount of data around disease and biology. Unfortunately, scientists hoping to go from data to new cures often require help from someone with experience in software engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Watershed Bio is helping scientists and bioinformaticians run experiments and get insights with a platform that lets users analyze complex datasets regardless of their computational skills. The cloud-based platform provides workflow templates and a customizable interface to help users explore and share data of all types, including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, high-content imaging, protein folding, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Scientists want to learn about the software and data science parts of the field, but they don’t want to become software engineers writing code just to understand their data,” co-founder and CEO Jonathan Wang ’13, SM ’15 says. “With Watershed, they don’t have to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watershed is being used by large and small research teams across industry and academia to drive discovery and decision-making. When new advanced analytic techniques are described in scientific journals, they can be added to Watershed’s platform immediately as templates, making cutting-edge tools more accessible and collaborative for researchers of all backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data in biology is growing exponentially, and the sequencing technologies generating this data are only getting better and cheaper,” Wang says. “Coming from MIT, this issue was right in my wheelhouse: It’s a tough technical problem. It’s also a meaningful problem because these people are working to treat diseases. They know all this data has value, but they struggle to use it. We want to help them unlock more insights faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No code discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang expected to major in biology at MIT, but he quickly got excited by the possibilities of building solutions that scaled to millions of people with computer science. He ended up earning both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). Wang also interned at a biology lab at MIT, where he was surprised how slow and labor-intensive experiments were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I saw the difference between biology and computer science, where you had these dynamic environments [in computer science] that let you get feedback immediately,” Wang says. “Even as a single person writing code, you have so much at your fingertips to play with.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While working on machine learning and high-performance computing at MIT, Wang also co-founded a high frequency trading firm with some classmates. His team hired researchers with PhD backgrounds in areas like math and physics to develop new trading strategies, but they quickly saw a bottleneck in their process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Things were moving slowly because the researchers were used to building prototypes,” Wang says. “These were small approximations of models they could run locally on their machines. To put those approaches into production, they needed engineers to make them work in a high-throughput way on a computing cluster. But the engineers didn’t understand the nature of the research, so there was a lot of back and forth. It meant ideas you thought could have been implemented in a day took weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve the problem, Wang’s team developed a software layer that made building production-ready models as easy as building prototypes on a laptop. Then, a few years after graduating MIT, Wang noticed technologies like DNA sequencing had become cheap and ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The bottleneck wasn’t sequencing anymore, so people said, ‘Let’s sequence everything,’” Wang recalls. “The limiting factor became computation. People didn’t know what to do with all the data being generated. Biologists were waiting for data scientists and bioinformaticians to help them, but those people didn’t always understand the biology at a deep enough level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation looked familiar to Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was exactly like what we saw in finance, where researchers were trying to work with engineers, but the engineers never fully understood, and you had all this inefficiency with people waiting on the engineers,” Wang says. “Meanwhile, I learned the biologists are hungry to run these experiments, but there is such a big gap they felt they had to become a software engineer or just focus on the science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang officially founded Watershed in 2019 with physician Mark Kalinich ’13, a former classmate at MIT who is no longer involved in day-to-day operations of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang has since heard from biotech and pharmaceutical executives about the growing complexity of biology research. Unlocking new insights increasingly involves analyzing data from entire genomes, population studies, RNA sequencing, mass spectrometry, and more. Developing personalized treatments or selecting patient populations for a clinical study can also require huge datasets, and there are new ways to analyze data being published in scientific journals all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, companies can run large-scale analyses on Watershed without having to set up their own servers or cloud computing accounts. Researchers can use ready-made templates that work with all the most common data types to accelerate their work. Popular AI-based tools like AlphaFold and Geneformer are also available, and Watershed’s platform makes sharing workflows and digging deeper into results easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The platform hits a sweet spot of usability and customizability for people of all backgrounds,” Wang says. “No science is ever truly the same. I avoid the word product because that implies you deploy something and then you just run it at scale forever. Research isn’t like that. Research is about coming up with an idea, testing it, and using the outcome to come up with another idea. The faster you can design, implement, and execute experiments, the faster you can move on to the next one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating biology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang believes Watershed is helping biologists keep up with the latest advances in biology and accelerating scientific discovery in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can help scientists unlock insights not a little bit faster, but 10 or 20 times faster, it can really make a difference,” Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watershed is being used by researchers in academia and in companies of all sizes. Executives at biotech and pharmaceutical companies also use Watershed to make decisions about new experiments and drug candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve seen success in all those areas, and the common thread is people understanding research but not being an expert in computer science or software engineering,” Wang says. “It’s exciting to see this industry develop. For me, it’s great being from MIT and now to be back in Kendall Square where Watershed is based. This is where so much of the cutting-edge progress is happening. We’re trying to do our part to enable the future of biology.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Watershed-Bio-01-PRESS.jpg?itok=0AN-NkrH\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Watershed Informatics offers researchers who aren’t developers a way to run large-scale analyses to accelerate biology.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/alumni\">Alumni/ae</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/disease\">Disease</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Ray Kurzweil ’70 reinforces his optimism in tech progress</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ray-kurzwei-reinforces-his-optimism-tech-progress-1010</link>\n  <description>Receiving the Robert A.

Muh Alumni Award from the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil offered his signature high-profile forecasts about how AI and computing will entirely blend with human functionality, and proposed that AI will lead to monumental gains in longevity, medicine, and other realms of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People do not appreciate that the rate of progress is accelerating,” Kurzweil said, forecasting “incredible breakthroughs” over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil delivered his lecture, titled “Reinventing Intelligence,” in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, which opened earlier in 2025 on the MIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Muh Award was founded and endowed by Robert A. Muh ’59 and his wife Berit, and is one of the leading alumni honors granted by SHASS and MIT. Muh, a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation, established the award, which is granted every two years for “extraordinary contributions” by alumni in the humanities, arts, and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert and Berit Muh were both present at the lecture, along with their daughter Carrie Muh ’96, ’97, SM ’97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agustín Rayo, dean of SHASS, offered introductory remarks, calling Kurzweil “one of the most prolific thinkers of our time.” Rayo added that Kurzweil “has built his life and career on the belief that ideas change the world, and change it for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has been an innovator in language recognition technologies, developing advances and founding companies that have served people who are blind or low-vision, and helped in music creation. He is also a best-selling author who has heralded advances in computing capabilities, and even the merging of human and machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial segment of Kurzweil’s lecture was autobiographical in focus, reflecting on his family and early years. The families of both of Kurzweil’s parents fled the Nazis in Europe, seeking refuge in the U.S., with the belief that people could create a brighter future for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My parents taught me the power of ideas can really change the world,” Kurzweil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing an early interest in how things worked, Kurzweil had decided to become an inventor by about the age of 7, he recalled. He also described his mother as being tremendously encouraging to him as a child. The two would take walks together, and the young Kurzweil would talk about all the things he imagined inventing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would tell her my ideas and no matter how fantastical they were, she believed them,” he said. “Now other parents might have simply chuckled … but she actually believed my ideas, and that actually gave me my confidence, and I think confidence is important in succeeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became interested in computing by the early 1960s and majored in both computer science and literature as an MIT undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has a long-running association with MIT extending far beyond his undergraduate studies. He served as a member of the MIT Corporation from 2005 to 2012 and was the 2001 recipient of the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize, an award for innovation, for his development of reading technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT has played a major role in my personal and professional life over the years,” Kurzweil said, calling himself “truly honored to receive this award.” Addressing Muh, he added: “Your longstanding commitment to our alma mater is inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from MIT, Kurzweil launched a successful career developing innovative computing products, including one that recognized text across all fonts and could produce an audio reading. He also developed leading-edge music synthesizers, among many other advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a corresponding part of his career, Kurzweil has become an energetic author, whose best-known books include “The Age of Intelligent Machines” (1990), “The Age of Spiritual Machines” (1999), “The Singularity Is Near” (2005), and “The Singularity Is Nearer” (2024), among many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil was recently named chief AI officer of Beyond Imagination, a robotics firm he co-founded; he has also held a position at Google in recent years, working on natural language technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Kurzweil underscored his view that, as exemplified and enabled by the growth of computing power over time, technological innovation moves at an exponential pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t really think about exponential growth; they think about linear growth,” Kurzweil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept, he said, makes him confident that a string of innovations will continue at remarkable speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the bigger transformations we’re going to see from AI in the near term is health and medicine,” Kurweil said, forecasting that human medical trials will be replaced by simulated “digital trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil also believes computing and AI advances can lead to so many medical advances it will soon produce a drastic improvement in human longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These incredible breakthroughs are going to lead to what we’ll call longevity escape velocity,” Kurzweil said. “By roughly 2032 when you live through a year, you’ll get back an entire year from scientific progress, and beyond that point you’ll get back more than a year for every year you live, so you’ll be going back into time as far as your health is concerned,” Kurweil said. He did offer that these advances will “start” with people who are the most diligent about their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil also outlined one of his best-known forecasts, that AI and people will be combined. “As we move forward, the lines between humans and technology will blur, until we are … one and the same,” Kurzweil said. “This is how we learn to merge with AI. In the 2030s, robots the size of molecules will go into our brains, noninvasively, through the capillaries, and will connect our brains directly to the cloud. Think of it like having a phone, but in your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By 2045, once we have fully merged with AI, our intelligence will no longer be constrained … it will expand a millionfold,” he said. “This is what we call the singularity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Kurzweil acknowledged, “Technology has always been a double-edged sword,” given that a drone can deliver either medical supplies or weaponry. “Threats of AI are real, must be taken seriously, [and] I think we are doing that,” he said. In any case, he added, we have “a moral imperative to realize the promise of new technologies while controlling the peril.” He concluded: “We are not doomed to fail to control any of these risks.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-KurzweilMuh-01-press.jpg?itok=e9r9_zj1\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Ray Kurzweil delivered his lecture, titled “Reinventing Intelligence,” in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building on Wednesday.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Hanley Valentin</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/special-events\">Special events and guest speakers</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/alumni\">Alumni/ae</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-corporation\">MIT Corporation</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MBZUAI launch international collaboration to shape the future of AI</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-schwarzman-college-computing-mbzuai-launch-collaboration-shape-future-ai-1008</link>\n  <description>The MIT–MBZUAI Collaborative Research Program will unite faculty and students from both institutions to advance AI and accelerate its use in pressing scientific and societal challenges.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:10:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-schwarzman-college-computing-mbzuai-launch-collaboration-shape-future-ai-1008</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Terri Park | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the &lt;a href=\"https://mbzuai.ac.ae/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (MBZUAI) recently celebrated the launch of the MIT–MBZUAI Collaborative Research Program, a new effort to strengthen the building blocks of artificial intelligence and accelerate its use in pressing scientific and societal challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the five-year agreement, faculty, students, and research staff from both institutions will collaborate on fundamental research projects to advance the technological foundations of AI and its applications in three core areas: scientific discovery, human thriving, and the health of the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Artificial intelligence is transforming nearly every aspect of human endeavor. MIT’s leadership in AI is greatly enriched through collaborations with leading academic institutions in the U.S. and around the world,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Our collaboration with MBZUAI reflects a shared commitment to advancing AI in ways that are responsible, inclusive, and globally impactful. Together, we can explore new horizons in AI and bring broad benefits to society.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This agreement will unite the efforts of researchers at two world-class institutions to advance frontier AI research across scientific discovery, human thriving, and the health of the planet. By combining MBZUAI’s focus on foundational models and real-world deployment with MIT’s depth in computing and interdisciplinary innovation, we are creating a transcontinental bridge for discovery. Together, we will not only expand the boundaries of AI science, but also ensure that these breakthroughs are pursued responsibly and applied where they matter most — improving human health, enabling intelligent robotics, and driving sustainable AI at scale,” says Eric Xing, president and university professor at MBZUAI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each institution has appointed an academic director to oversee the program on its campus. At MIT, &lt;a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;Philip Isola&lt;/a&gt;, the Class of 1948 Career Development Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, will serve as program lead.

The findings will be openly publishable, and each project will be led by a principal investigator from MIT and one from MBZUAI, with project selections made by a steering committee composed of representatives from both institutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/mit-mbzuai.jpg?itok=6N9WCIQx\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Dan Huttenlocher (left), dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing; Eric Xing (standing), president of MBZUAI; and Sami Haddadin, VP of research at MBZUAI, held a signing ceremony officially launching the MIT-MBZUAI Collaborative Research Program.

Whether you’re writing Shakespearean sonnets, debugging code, or need an answer to an obscure trivia question, artificial intelligence systems seem to have you covered. The source of this versatility? Billions, or even trillions, of textual data points across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Those data aren’t enough to teach a robot to be a helpful household or factory assistant, though. To understand how to handle, stack, and place various arrangements of objects across diverse environments, robots need demonstrations. You can think of robot training data as a collection of how-to videos that walk the systems through each motion of a task. Collecting these demonstrations on real robots is time-consuming and not perfectly repeatable, so engineers have created training data by generating simulations with AI (which don’t often reflect real-world physics), or tediously handcrafting each digital environment from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Toyota Research Institute may have found a way to create the diverse, realistic training grounds robots need. Their “&lt;a href=\"https://steerable-scene-generation.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;steerable scene generation&lt;/a&gt;” approach creates digital scenes of things like kitchens, living rooms, and restaurants that engineers can use to simulate lots of real-world interactions and scenarios. Trained on over 44 million 3D rooms filled with models of objects such as tables and plates, the tool places existing assets in new scenes, then refines each one into a physically accurate, lifelike environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Steerable scene generation creates these 3D worlds by “steering” a diffusion model — an AI system that generates a visual from random noise — toward a scene you’d find in everyday life. The researchers used this generative system to “in-paint” an environment, filling in particular elements throughout the scene. You can imagine a blank canvas suddenly turning into a kitchen scattered with 3D objects, which are gradually rearranged into a scene that imitates real-world physics. For example, the system ensures that a fork doesn’t pass through a bowl on a table — a common glitch in 3D graphics known as “clipping,” where models overlap or intersect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How exactly steerable scene generation guides its creation toward realism, however, depends on the strategy you choose. Its main strategy is “Monte Carlo tree search” (MCTS), where the model creates a series of alternative scenes, filling them out in different ways toward a particular objective (like making a scene more physically realistic, or including as many edible items as possible). It’s used by the AI program AlphaGo to beat human opponents in Go (a game similar to chess), as the system considers potential sequences of moves before choosing the most advantageous one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are the first to apply MCTS to scene generation by framing the scene generation task as a sequential decision-making process,” says MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) PhD student Nicholas Pfaff, who is a CSAIL researcher and a lead author on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://steerable-scene-generation.github.io/\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; presenting the work. “We keep building on top of partial scenes to produce better or more desired scenes over time. As a result, MCTS creates scenes that are more complex than what the diffusion model was trained on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In one particularly telling experiment, MCTS added the maximum number of objects to a simple restaurant scene. It featured as many as 34 items on a table, including massive stacks of dim sum dishes, after training on scenes with only 17 objects on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Steerable scene generation also allows you to generate diverse training scenarios via reinforcement learning — essentially, teaching a diffusion model to fulfill an objective by trial-and-error. After you train on the initial data, your system undergoes a second training stage, where you outline a reward (basically, a desired outcome with a score indicating how close you are to that goal). The model automatically learns to create scenes with higher scores, often producing scenarios that are quite different from those it was trained on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users can also prompt the system directly by typing in specific visual descriptions (like “a kitchen with four apples and a bowl on the table”). Then, steerable scene generation can bring your requests to life with precision. For example, the tool accurately followed users’ prompts at rates of 98 percent when building scenes of pantry shelves, and 86 percent for messy breakfast tables. Both marks are at least a 10 percent improvement over comparable methods like&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21066\"&gt;MiDiffusion&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14207\"&gt;DiffuScene&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system can also complete specific scenes via prompting or light directions (like “come up with a different scene arrangement using the same objects”). You could ask it to place apples on several plates on a kitchen table, for instance, or put board games and books on a shelf. It’s essentially “filling in the blank” by slotting items in empty spaces, but preserving the rest of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;According to the researchers, the strength of their project lies in its ability to create many scenes that roboticists can actually use. “A key insight from our findings is that it’s OK for the scenes we pre-trained on to not exactly resemble the scenes that we actually want,” says Pfaff. “Using our steering methods, we can move beyond that broad distribution and sample from a ‘better’ one. In other words, generating the diverse, realistic, and task-aligned scenes that we actually want to train our robots in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Such vast scenes became the testing grounds where they could record a virtual robot interacting with different items. The machine carefully placed forks and knives into a cutlery holder, for instance, and rearranged bread onto plates in various 3D settings. Each simulation appeared fluid and realistic, resembling the real-world, adaptable robots steerable scene generation could help train, one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;While the system could be an encouraging path forward in generating lots of diverse training data for robots, the researchers say their work is more of a proof of concept. In the future, they’d like to use generative AI to create entirely new objects and scenes, instead of using a fixed library of assets. They also plan to incorporate articulated objects that the robot could open or twist (like cabinets or jars filled with food) to make the scenes even more interactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To make their virtual environments even more realistic, Pfaff and his colleagues may incorporate real-world objects by using a library of objects and scenes pulled from images on the internet and using their previous work on “&lt;a href=\"https://scalable-real2sim.github.io/\"&gt;Scalable Real2Sim&lt;/a&gt;.” By expanding how diverse and lifelike AI-constructed robot testing grounds can be, the team hopes to build a community of users that’ll create lots of data, which could then be used as a massive dataset to teach dexterous robots different skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today, creating realistic scenes for simulation can be quite a challenging endeavor; procedural generation can readily produce a large number of scenes, but they likely won’t be representative of the environments the robot would encounter in the real world. Manually creating bespoke scenes is both time-consuming and expensive,” says Jeremy Binagia, an applied scientist at Amazon Robotics who wasn’t involved in the paper. “Steerable scene generation offers a better approach: train a generative model on a large collection of pre-existing scenes and adapt it (using a strategy such as reinforcement learning) to specific downstream applications. Compared to previous works that leverage an off-the-shelf vision-language model or focus just on arranging objects in a 2D grid, this approach guarantees physical feasibility and considers full 3D translation and rotation, enabling the generation of much more interesting scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Steerable scene generation with post training and inference-time search provides a novel and efficient framework for automating scene generation at scale,” says Toyota Research Institute roboticist Rick Cory SM ’08, PhD ’10, who also wasn’t involved in the paper. “Moreover, it can generate ‘never-before-seen’ scenes that are deemed important for downstream tasks. In the future, combining this framework with vast internet data could unlock an important milestone towards efficient training of robots for deployment in the real world.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfaff wrote the paper with senior author Russ Tedrake, the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT; a senior vice president of large behavior models at the Toyota Research Institute; and CSAIL principal investigator. Other authors were Toyota Research Institute robotics researcher Hongkai Dai SM ’12, PhD ’16; team lead and Senior Research Scientist Sergey Zakharov; and Carnegie Mellon University PhD student Shun Iwase. Their work was supported, in part, by Amazon and the Toyota Research Institute.

The biennial journeys activated in her a motivation that continues to shape her research and her teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting her family home in Massachusetts, Donti — now the Silverman Family Career Development Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems — was struck by the disparities in how people live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very clear to me the extent to which inequity is a rampant issue around the world,” Donti says. “From a young age, I knew that I definitely wanted to address that issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That motivation was further stoked by a high school biology teacher, who focused his class on climate and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned that climate change, this huge, important issue, would exacerbate inequity,” Donti says. “That really stuck with me and put a fire in my belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when Donti enrolled at Harvey Mudd College, she thought she would direct her energy toward the study of chemistry or materials science to create next-generation solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those plans, however, were jilted. Donti “fell in love” with computer science, and then discovered work by researchers in the United Kingdom who were arguing that artificial intelligence and machine learning would be essential to help integrate renewables into power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the first time I’d seen those two interests brought together,” she says. “I got hooked and have been working on that topic ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pursuing a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, Donti was able to design her degree to include computer science and public policy. In her research, she explored the need for fundamental algorithms and tools that could manage, at scale, power grids relying heavily on renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to have a hand in developing those algorithms and tool kits by creating new machine learning techniques grounded in computer science,” she says. “But I wanted to make sure that the way I was doing the work was grounded both in the actual energy systems domain and working with people in that domain” to provide what was actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donti was working on her PhD, she co-founded a nonprofit called Climate Change AI. Her objective, she says, was to help the community of people involved in climate and sustainability — “be they computer scientists, academics, practitioners, or policymakers” — to come together and access resources, connection, and education “to help them along that journey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the climate space,” she says, “you need experts in particular climate change-related sectors, experts in different technical and social science tool kits, problem owners, affected users, policymakers who know the regulations — all of those — to have on-the-ground scalable impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Donti came to MIT in September 2023, it was not surprising that she was drawn by its initiatives directing the application of computer science toward society’s biggest problems, especially the current threat to the health of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really thinking about where technology has a much longer-horizon impact and how technology, society, and policy all have to work together,” Donti says. “Technology is not just one-and-done and monetizable in the context of a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work uses deep learning models to incorporate the physics and hard constraints of electric power systems that employ renewables for better forecasting, optimization, and control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is already really widely used for things like solar power forecasting, which is a prerequisite to managing and balancing power grids,” she says. “My focus is, how do you improve the algorithms for actually balancing power grids in the face of a range of time-varying renewables?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Donti’s breakthroughs is a promising solution for power grid operators to be able to optimize for cost, taking into account the actual physical realities&amp;nbsp;of the grid, rather than relying on approximations. While the solution is not yet deployed, it appears to work 10 times faster, and far more cheaply, than previous technologies, and has attracted the attention of grid operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another technology she is developing works to provide data that can be used in training machine learning systems for power system optimization. In general, much data related to the systems is private, either because it is proprietary or because of security concerns. Donti and her research group are working to create synthetic data and benchmarks that, Donti says, “can help to expose some of the underlying problems” in making power systems more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is,” Donti says, “can we bring our datasets to a point such that they are just hard enough to drive progress?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her efforts, Donti has been awarded the U.S. Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. She was recognized as part of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 2021 list of “35 Innovators Under 35” and Vox’s 2023 “Future Perfect 50.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next spring, Donti will co-teach a class called AI for Climate Action with Sara Beery, EECS assistant professor, whose focus is AI for biodiversity and ecosystems, and Abigail Bodner, an assistant professor in Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, holding an MIT Schwarzman College of Computing shared position with EECS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re all super-excited about it,” Donti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to MIT, Donti says, “I knew that there would be an ecosystem of people who really cared, not just about success metrics like publications and citation counts, but about the impact of our work on society.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-LIDS-Priya-Donti.jpg?itok=sHTN9uLy\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“Machine learning is already really widely used for things like solar power forecasting, which is a prerequisite to managing and balancing power grids,” says EECS assistant professor and LIDS PI Priya Donti. “My focus is: How do you improve the algorithms for actually balancing power grids in the face of a range of time-varying renewables?”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Adam Glanzman</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/profile\">Profile</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/renewable-energy\">Renewable energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electric-grid\">Electric grid</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-and-policy\">Technology and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New prediction model could improve the reliability of fusion power plants</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-prediction-model-could-improve-reliability-fusion-power-plants-1007</link>\n  <description>The approach combines physics and machine learning to avoid damaging disruptions when powering down tokamak fusion machines.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-prediction-model-could-improve-reliability-fusion-power-plants-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are machines that are meant to hold and harness the power of the sun. These fusion machines use powerful magnets to contain a plasma hotter than the sun’s core and push the plasma’s atoms to fuse and release energy. If tokamaks can operate safely and efficiently, the machines could one day provide clean and limitless fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are a number of experimental tokamaks in operation around the world, with more underway. Most are small-scale research machines built to investigate how the devices can spin up plasma and harness its energy. One of the challenges that tokamaks face is how to safely and reliably turn off a plasma current that is circulating at speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second, at temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such “rampdowns” are necessary when a plasma becomes unstable. To prevent the plasma from further disrupting and potentially damaging the device’s interior, operators ramp down the plasma current. But occasionally the rampdown itself can destabilize the plasma. In some machines, rampdowns have caused scrapes and scarring to the tokamak’s interior — minor damage that still requires considerable time and resources to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at MIT have developed a method to predict how plasma in a tokamak will behave during a rampdown. The team combined machine-learning tools with a physics-based model of plasma dynamics to simulate a plasma’s behavior and any instabilities that may arise as the plasma is ramped down and turned off. The researchers trained and tested the new model on plasma data from an experimental tokamak in Switzerland. They found the method quickly learned how plasma would evolve as it was tuned down in different ways. What’s more, the method achieved a high level of accuracy using a relatively small amount of data. This training efficiency is promising, given that each experimental run of a tokamak is expensive and quality data is limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which the team highlights this week in an &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63917-x\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;open-access &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, could improve the safety and reliability of future fusion power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For fusion to be a useful energy source it’s going to have to be reliable,” says lead author Allen Wang, a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics and a member of the &lt;a href=\"https://disruptions.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Disruption Group&lt;/a&gt; at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). “To be reliable, we need to get good at managing our plasmas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include PSFC Principal Research Scientist and Disruptions Group leader Cristina Rea, and members of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) Oswin So, Charles Dawson, and Professor Chuchu Fan, along with Mark (Dan) Boyer of Commonwealth Fusion Systems and collaborators from the Swiss Plasma Center in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A delicate balance”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are experimental fusion devices that were first built in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The device gets its name from a Russian acronym that translates to a “toroidal chamber with magnetic coils.” Just as its name describes, a tokamak is toroidal, or donut-shaped, and uses powerful magnets to contain and spin up a gas to temperatures and energies high enough that atoms in the resulting plasma can fuse and release energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, tokamak experiments are relatively low-energy in scale, with few approaching the size and output needed to generate safe, reliable, usable energy. Disruptions in experimental, low-energy tokamaks are generally not an issue. But as fusion machines scale up to grid-scale dimensions, controlling much higher-energy plasmas at all phases will be paramount to maintaining a machine’s safe and efficient operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uncontrolled plasma terminations, even during rampdown, can generate intense heat fluxes damaging the internal walls,” Wang notes. “Quite often, especially with the high-performance plasmas, rampdowns actually can push the plasma closer to some instability limits. So, it’s a delicate balance. And there’s a lot of focus now on how to manage instabilities so that we can routinely and reliably take these plasmas and safely power them down. And there are relatively few studies done on how to do that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing down the pulse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang and his colleagues developed a model to predict how a plasma will behave during tokamak rampdown. While they could have simply applied machine-learning tools such as a neural network to learn signs of instabilities in plasma data, “you would need an ungodly amount of data” for such tools to discern the very subtle and ephemeral changes in extremely high-temperature, high-energy plasmas, Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers paired a neural network with an existing model that simulates plasma dynamics according to the fundamental rules of physics. With this combination of machine learning and a physics-based plasma simulation, the team found that only a couple hundred pulses at low performance, and a small handful of pulses at high performance, were sufficient to train and validate the new model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data they used for the new study came from the TCV, the Swiss “variable configuration tokamak” operated by the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). The TCV is a small experimental fusion experimental device that is used for research purposes, often as test bed for next-generation device solutions. Wang used the data from several hundred TCV plasma pulses that included properties of the plasma such as its temperature and energies during each pulse’s ramp-up, run, and ramp-down. He trained the new model on this data, then tested it and found it was able to accurately predict the plasma’s evolution given the initial conditions of a particular tokamak run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed an algorithm to translate the model’s predictions into practical “trajectories,” or plasma-managing instructions that a tokamak controller can automatically carry out to for instance adjust the magnets or temperature maintain the plasma’s stability. They implemented the algorithm on several TCV runs and found that it produced trajectories that safely ramped down a plasma pulse, in some cases faster and without disruptions compared to runs without the new method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point the plasma will always go away, but we call it a disruption when the plasma goes away at high energy. Here, we ramped the energy down to nothing,” Wang notes. “We did it a number of times. And we did things much better across the board. So,&amp;nbsp;we had statistical confidence that we made things better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinout that intends to build the world’s first compact, grid-scale fusion power plant. The company is developing a demo tokamak, SPARC, designed to produce net-energy plasma, meaning that it should generate more energy than it takes to heat up the plasma. Wang and his colleagues are working with CFS on ways that the new prediction model and tools like it can better predict plasma behavior and prevent costly disruptions to enable safe and reliable fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to tackle the science questions to make fusion routinely useful,” Wang says. “What we’ve done here is the start of what is still a long journey. But I think we’ve made some nice progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional support for the research came from the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, via the Euratom Research and Training Program and funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Tokamak-Tuning-01.jpg?itok=9QY6-LY8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT researchers have developed a prediction model that could improve the safety and reliability of tokamak fusion reactors.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/fusion\">Fusion</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/fluid-dynamics\">Fluid dynamics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/plasma-science-and-fusion-center\">Plasma Science and Fusion Center</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/renewable-energy\">Renewable energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-power-and-reactors\">Nuclear power and reactors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Printable aluminum alloy sets strength records, may enable lighter aircraft parts</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/printable-aluminum-alloy-sets-strength-records-may-enable-lighter-aircraft-parts-1007</link>\n  <description>Incorporating machine learning, MIT engineers developed a way to 3D print alloys that are much stronger than conventionally manufactured versions.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/printable-aluminum-alloy-sets-strength-records-may-enable-lighter-aircraft-parts-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a printable aluminum alloy that can withstand high temperatures and is five times stronger than traditionally manufactured aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new printable metal is made from a mix of aluminum and other elements that the team identified using a combination of simulations and machine learning, which significantly pruned the number of possible combinations of materials to search through. While traditional methods would require simulating over 1 million possible combinations of materials, the team’s new machine learning-based approach needed only to evaluate 40 possible compositions before identifying an ideal mix for a high-strength, printable aluminum alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they printed the alloy and tested the resulting material, the team confirmed that, as predicted, the aluminum alloy was as strong as the strongest aluminum alloys that are manufactured today using traditional casting methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;researchers envision that the new printable aluminum could be made into stronger, more lightweight and temperature-resistant products, such as fan blades in jet engines. Fan blades are traditionally&amp;nbsp;cast from titanium — a material that is more than 50 percent heavier and up to 10 times costlier than aluminum — or made from advanced composites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can use lighter, high-strength material, this would save a considerable amount of energy for the transportation industry,” says&amp;nbsp;Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi, who led the work as a postdoc at MIT and is now an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because 3D printing can produce complex geometries, save material, and enable unique designs, we see this printable alloy as something that could also be used in advanced vacuum pumps, high-end automobiles, and cooling devices for data centers,” adds John Hart, the Class of 1922 Professor and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart and Taheri-Mousavi provide details on the new printable aluminum design in a &lt;a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202509507\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s MIT co-authors include Michael Xu, Clay Houser, Shaolou Wei, James LeBeau, and Greg Olson, along with Florian Hengsbach and Mirko Schaper of Paderborn University in Germany, and Zhaoxuan Ge and Benjamin Glaser of Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro-sizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work grew out of an MIT class that Taheri-Mousavi took in 2020, which was taught by Greg Olson, professor of the practice in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. As part of the class, students learned to use computational simulations to design high-performance alloys. Alloys are materials that are made from a mix of different elements, the combination of which imparts exceptional strength and other unique properties to the material as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson challenged the class to design an aluminum alloy that would be stronger than the strongest printable aluminum alloy designed to date. As with most materials, the strength of aluminum depends in large part on its microstructure: The smaller and more densely packed its microscopic constituents, or “precipitates,” the stronger the alloy would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the class used computer simulations to methodically combine aluminum with various types and concentrations of elements, to simulate and predict the resulting alloy’s strength. However, the exercise failed to produce a stronger result. At the end of the class, Taheri-Mousavi wondered: Could machine learning do better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, there are a lot of things that contribute nonlinearly to a material’s properties, and you are lost,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “With machine-learning tools, they can point you to where you need to focus, and tell you for example, these two elements are controlling this feature. It lets you explore the design space more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer by layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Taheri-Mousavi continued where Olson’s class left off, this time looking to identify a stronger recipe for aluminum alloy. This time, she used machine-learning techniques designed to efficiently comb through data such as the properties of elements, to identify key connections and correlations that should lead to a more desirable outcome or product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She found that, using just 40 compositions mixing aluminum with different elements, their machine-learning approach quickly homed in on a recipe for an aluminum alloy with higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and therefore higher strength, than what the previous studies identified. The alloy’s strength was even higher than what they could identify after simulating over 1 million possibilities without using machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To physically produce this new strong, small-precipitate alloy, the team realized 3D printing would be the way to go instead of traditional metal casting, in which molten liquid aluminum is poured into a mold and is left to cool and harden. The longer this cooling time is, the more likely the individual precipitate is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that 3D printing, broadly also known as additive manufacturing, can be a faster way to cool and solidify the aluminum alloy. Specifically, they considered laser bed powder fusion (LBPF) — a technique by which a powder is deposited, layer by layer, on a surface in a desired pattern and then quickly melted by a laser that traces over the pattern. The melted pattern is thin enough that it solidfies quickly before another layer is deposited and similarly “printed.” The team found that LBPF’s inherently rapid cooling and solidification enabled the small-precipitate, high-strength aluminum alloy that their machine learning method predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes we have to think about how to get a material to be compatible with 3D printing,” says study co-author John Hart. “Here, 3D printing opens a new door because of the unique characteristics of the process — particularly, the fast cooling rate. Very rapid freezing of the alloy after it’s melted by the laser creates this special set of properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting their idea into practice, the researchers ordered a formulation of printable powder, based on their new aluminum alloy recipe. They sent the powder — a mix of aluminum and five other elements — to collaborators in Germany, who printed small samples of the alloy using their in-house LPBF system. The samples were then sent to MIT where the team ran multiple tests to measure the alloy’s strength and image the samples’ microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results confirmed the predictions made by their initial machine learning search: The printed alloy was five times stronger than a casted counterpart and 50 percent stronger than alloys designed using conventional simulations without machine learning. The new alloy’s microstructure also consisted of a higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and was stable at high temperatures of up to 400 degrees Celsius — a very high temperature for aluminum alloys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are applying similar machine-learning techniques to further optimize other properties of the alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our methodology opens new doors for anyone who wants to do 3D printing alloy design,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “My dream is that one day, passengers looking out their airplane window will see fan blades of engines made from our aluminum alloys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was carried out, in part, using MIT.nano’s characterization facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Printing-Aluminum-01-press.jpg?itok=WsN06Kug\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new 3-D-printed aluminum alloy is stronger than traditional aluminum, due to a key recipe that, when printed, produces aluminum (illustrated in brown) with nanometer scale precipitates (in light blue).

The broad-spectrum drugs often prescribed for gut flare-ups can kill helpful microbes alongside harmful ones, sometimes worsening symptoms over time. When fighting gut inflammation, you don’t always want to bring a sledgehammer to a knife fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and McMaster University have &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02142-0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;identified a new compound&lt;/a&gt; that takes a more targeted approach. The molecule, called enterololin, suppresses a group of bacteria linked to Crohn’s disease flare-ups while leaving the rest of the microbiome largely intact. Using a generative AI model, the team mapped how the compound works, a process that usually takes years but was accelerated here to just months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This discovery speaks to a central challenge in antibiotic development,” says Jon Stokes, senior author of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02142-0\"&gt;new paper on the work&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster, and research affiliate at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. “The problem isn’t finding molecules that kill bacteria in a dish — we’ve been able to do that for a long time. A major hurdle is figuring out what those molecules actually do inside bacteria. Without that detailed understanding, you can’t develop these early-stage antibiotics into safe and effective therapies for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enterololin is a stride toward precision antibiotics: treatments designed to knock out only the bacteria causing trouble. In mouse models of Crohn’s-like inflammation, the drug zeroed in on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, a gut-dwelling bacterium that can worsen flares, while leaving most other microbial residents untouched. Mice given enterololin recovered faster and maintained a healthier microbiome than those treated with vancomycin, a common antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Pinning down a drug’s mechanism of action, the molecular target it binds inside bacterial cells, normally requires years of painstaking experiments. Stokes’ lab discovered enterololin using a high-throughput screening approach, but determining its target would have been the bottleneck. Here, the team turned to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/speeding-drug-discovery-with-diffusion-generative-models-diffdock-0331\"&gt;DiffDock&lt;/a&gt;, a generative AI model developed at CSAIL by MIT PhD student Gabriele Corso and MIT Professor Regina Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;DiffDock was designed to predict how small molecules fit into the binding pockets of proteins, a notoriously difficult problem in structural biology. Traditional docking algorithms search through possible orientations using scoring rules, often producing noisy results. DiffDock instead frames docking as a probabilistic reasoning problem: a diffusion model iteratively refines guesses until it converges on the most likely binding mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“In just a couple of minutes, the model predicted that enterololin binds to a protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential for transporting lipoproteins in certain bacteria,” says Barzilay, who also co-leads the Jameel Clinic. “That was a very concrete lead — one that could guide experiments, rather than replace them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Stokes’ group then put that prediction to the test. Using DiffDock predictions as an experimental GPS, they first evolved enterololin-resistant mutants of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in the lab, which revealed that changes in the mutant’s DNA mapped to lolCDE, precisely where DiffDock had predicted enterololin to bind. They also performed RNA sequencing to see which bacterial genes switched on or off when exposed to the drug, as well as used CRISPR to selectively knock down expression of the expected target. These laboratory experiments all revealed disruptions in pathways tied to lipoprotein transport, exactly what DiffDock had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“When you see the computational model and the wet-lab data pointing to the same mechanism, that’s when you start to believe you’ve figured something out,” says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For Barzilay, the project highlights a shift in how AI is used in the life sciences. “A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active,” she says. “What we’re showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;That distinction matters because mechanism-of-action studies are often a major rate-limiting step in drug development. Traditional approaches can take 18 months to two years, or more, and cost millions of dollars. In this case, the MIT–McMaster team cut the timeline to about six months, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enterololin is still in the early stages of development, but translation is already underway. Stokes’ spinout company, Stoked Bio, has licensed the compound and is optimizing its properties for potential human use. Early work is also exploring derivatives of the molecule against other resistant pathogens, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. If all goes well, clinical trials could begin within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers also see broader implications. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have long been sought as a way to treat infections without collateral damage to the microbiome, but they have been difficult to discover and validate. AI tools like DiffDock could make that process more practical, rapidly enabling a new generation of targeted antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For patients with Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel conditions, the prospect of a drug that reduces symptoms without destabilizing the microbiome could mean a meaningful improvement in quality of life. And in the bigger picture, precision antibiotics may help tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“What excites me is not just this compound, but the idea that we can start thinking about the mechanism of action elucidation as something we can do more quickly, with the right combination of AI, human intuition, and laboratory experiments,” says Stokes. “That has the potential to change how we approach drug discovery for many diseases, not just Crohn’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“One of the greatest challenges to our health is the increase of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that evade even our best antibiotics,” adds Yves Brun, professor at the University of Montreal and distinguished professor emeritus at Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “AI is becoming an important tool in our fight against these bacteria. This study uses a powerful and elegant combination of AI methods to determine the mechanism of action of a new antibiotic candidate, an important step in its potential development as a therapeutic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corso, Barzilay, and Stokes wrote the paper with McMaster researchers Denise B.

Bakshi started in the role earlier this month at the start of the school year and will collaborate closely with the managing director, Ethernet Inventors Professor of the Practice Bill Aulet, to elevate the center to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ana is uniquely qualified for this role through her knowledge and experience in entrepreneurship education at the highest levels, paired with her exceptional leadership and execution skills,” says Aulet. “Ana is committed to creating the highest-quality centers and institutes for entrepreneurs, first at King’s College London, where we met over 10 years ago, and then at Oxford University. This ideal skill set is compounded by her experience in leading high-growth companies, most recently as the chief operation officer in an award-winning AI startup. I’m honored and thrilled to welcome her to MIT — her knowledge and energy will greatly elevate our community, and the field as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rapidly changing environment creates imperative for raising the bar for entrepreneurship education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to raise the bar for innovation-driven entrepreneurship education is of utmost importance in today's world. The rate of change is getting faster and faster every day, especially with artificial intelligence, and is generating new problems that need to be solved, as well as exacerbating existing problems in climate, health care, manufacturing, future of work, education, and economic stratification, to name but a few. The world needs more entrepreneurs and better entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi joins the Trust Center at a time when MIT is at the forefront of helping to develop people and systems that can turn challenges into opportunities using an entrepreneurial mindset, skill set, and way of operating.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi’s deep experience and success will be key to unlocking this opportunity. “I am honored to be joining MIT and the Trust Center at a time when education and entrepreneurship have the chance to shape the greatest good for the greatest number,” Bakshi says. “In an era defined by both extraordinary challenges and extraordinary possibilities, the future will be built by those bold enough to try, and MIT will be at the forefront of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating academic research into real-world impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi has built two world-class entrepreneurship centers from the ground up. She served as the founding director at King’s College and then at Oxford. In this role, she was responsible for all aspects of these centers, including fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at Oxford, she authored a data-driven approach to determining efficacy of outcomes for their programs, as evidenced by a 61-page study, “Universities: Drivers of Prosperity and Economic Recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the director of the Oxford Foundry (Oxford’s cross-university entrepreneurship center), Bakshi focused on investing in ambitious founders and talent. The center was backed by global entrepreneurial leaders such as the founders of LinkedIn and Twitter, with corporate partnerships including Santander and EY, and investment funds including Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE). As of 2021, the startups supported by the Foundry and King’s College have raised over $500 million and have created nearly 3,000 jobs, spanning diverse industries including health tech, climate tech, cybersecurity, fintech, and deep tech spinouts focusing on world-class science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she built the highly successful and economically sustainable&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/centres-and-initiatives/oxford-said-entrepreneurship-centre/e-school\"&gt;Entrepreneurship School&lt;/a&gt;, Oxford’s first digital online learning platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi comes to MIT after having worked in the private sector as the chief operating officer (COO) in a rapidly growing artificial intelligence startup for almost two years,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.quench.ai/\"&gt;Quench.ai&lt;/a&gt;, with offices in London and New York City. She was the first C-suite employee at Quench.ai, serving as COO and now senior advisor, helping companies unlock value from their knowledge through AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right place, right time, right person moving at the speed of MIT AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, then turbocharged in the 1940s with the creation and operation of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Radiation_Laboratory\"&gt;RadLab&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing to this day, entrepreneurship is at the core of MIT’s identity and mission.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"MIT has been a leader in entrepreneurship for decades. It’s now the third leg of the school, alongside teaching and research,” says Mark Gorenberg ’76, chair of the MIT Corporation. “I’m excited to have such a transformative leader as Ana join the Trust Center team, and I look forward to the impact she will have on the students and the wider academic community at MIT as we enter an exciting new phase in company building, driven by the accelerated use of AI and emerging technologies.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a time where we are rethinking management education, entrepreneurship as an interdisciplinary field to create impact is even more important to our future. To have such an experienced and accomplished leader in academia and the startup world, especially in AI, reinforces our commitment to be a global leader in this field,” says Richard M. Locke, John C Head III Dean at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is a unique hub of research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and that special mix creates massive positive impact that ripples around the world,” says Frederic Kerrest, MIT Sloan MBA ’09, co-founder of Okta, and member of the MIT Corporation. “In a rapidly changing, AI-driven world, Ana has the skills and experience to further accelerate MIT’s global leadership in entrepreneurship education to ensure that our students launch and scale the next generation of groundbreaking, innovation-driven startups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to her time at Oxford and King’s College, Bakshi served as an elected councilor representing 6,000-plus constituents, held roles in international nongovernmental organizations, and led product execution strategy at MAHI, an award-winning family-led craft sauce startup, available in thousands of major retailers across the U.K.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi sits on the&amp;nbsp;advisory council for conservation charity&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://savetheelephants.org/\"&gt;Save the Elephants&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging AI-driven and scientific approaches to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect elephant populations.&amp;nbsp;Her work and impact have been featured across &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, BBC, &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;. Bakshi was twice honored as a Top 50 Woman in Tech (U.K.), most recently in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI changes how we learn, how we build, and how we scale, my focus will be on helping MIT expand its support for phenomenal talent — students and faculty — with the skills, ecosystem, and backing to turn knowledge into impact,” Bakshi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 years of impact to date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center was founded in 1990 by the late Professor Edward Roberts and serves all MIT students across all schools and all disciplines.&amp;nbsp;It supports 60-plus courses and extensive extracurricular programming, including the delta v academic accelerator. Much of the work of the center is generated through the Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology, which offers a proven approach to create new ventures. Over a thousand schools and other organizations across the world use Disciplined Entrepreneurship books and resources to teach entrepreneurship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with AI-powered tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/orbit/\"&gt;Orbit&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-ai-jetpack-accelerates-entrepreneurial-process-0919\"&gt;JetPack&lt;/a&gt;, the Trust Center is changing the way that entrepreneurship is taught and practiced. Its mission is to produce the next generation of innovation-driven entrepreneurs while advancing the field more broadly to make it both rigorous and practical. This approach of leveraging proven evidence-based methodology, emerging technology, the ingenuity of MIT students, and responding to industry shifts is similar to how MIT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cheme.mit.edu/about/history/\"&gt;established the field of chemical engineering in the 1890s&lt;/a&gt;. The desired result in both cases was to create a comprehensive, integrated, scalable, rigorous, and practical curriculum to create a new workforce to address the nation’s and world’s greatest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-martintrust-bakshi.jpg?itok=GiAfFGg-\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Ana Bakshi is the new executive director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Chris Burns</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/leadership\">Leadership</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/staff\">Staff</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/business\">Business and management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/martin-trust-center-mit-entrepreneurship\">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Lincoln Lab unveils the most powerful AI supercomputer at any US university</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/lincoln-lab-unveils-most-powerful-ai-supercomputer-at-any-us-university-1002</link>\n  <description>Optimized for generative AI, TX-GAIN is driving innovation in biodefense, materials discovery, cybersecurity, and other areas of research and development.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 15:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/lincoln-lab-unveils-most-powerful-ai-supercomputer-at-any-us-university-1002</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Kylie Foy | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The new TX-Generative AI Next (TX-GAIN) computing system at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center&lt;/a&gt;  (LLSC) is the most powerful AI supercomputer at any U.S. university. With its recent ranking from  &lt;a href=\"https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;TOP500&lt;/a&gt;, which biannually publishes a list of the top supercomputers in various categories, TX-GAIN joins the ranks of other powerful systems at the LLSC, all supporting research and development at Lincoln Laboratory and across the MIT campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"TX-GAIN will enable our researchers to achieve scientific and engineering breakthroughs. The system will play a large role in supporting generative AI, physical simulation, and data analysis across all research areas,\" says Lincoln Laboratory Fellow&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jeremy Kepner&lt;/a&gt;, who heads the LLSC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC is a key resource for accelerating innovation at Lincoln Laboratory. Thousands of researchers tap into the LLSC to analyze data, train models, and run simulations for federally funded research projects. The supercomputers have been used, for example,&amp;nbsp;to simulate billions of aircraft encounters to develop collision-avoidance systems for the Federal Aviation Administration, and to train models in the complex tasks of autonomous navigation for the Department of Defense. Over the years, LLSC capabilities have been essential to numerous&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/#AwardsEnabled\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;award-winning technologies&lt;/a&gt;, including those that have improved  airline safety,  prevented the spread of new diseases, and  aided in hurricane responses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, TX-GAIN is especially equipped for developing and applying generative AI. Whereas traditional AI focuses on categorization tasks, like identifying whether a photo depicts a dog or cat, generative AI produces entirely new outputs. Kepner describes it as a mathematical combination of interpolation (filling in the gaps between known data points) and extrapolation (extending data beyond known points). Today, generative AI is widely known for its use of large language models to create human-like responses to user prompts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lincoln Laboratory, teams are applying generative AI to various domains beyond large language models. They are using the technology, for instance, to evaluate radar signatures, supplement weather data where coverage is missing, root out anomalies in network traffic, and explore chemical interactions to design new medicines and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable such intense computations, TX-GAIN is powered by more than 600 NVIDIA graphics processing unit accelerators specially designed for AI operations, in addition to traditional high-performance computing hardware. With a peak performance of two AI exaflops (two quintillion floating-point operations per second), TX-GAIN is the top AI system at a university, and in the Northeast.&amp;nbsp;Since TX-GAIN came online this summer, researchers have taken notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"TX-GAIN is allowing us to model not only significantly more protein interactions than ever before, but also much larger proteins with more atoms. This new computational capability is a game-changer for protein characterization efforts in biological defense,\" says Rafael Jaimes, a researcher in Lincoln Laboratory's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/counter-weapons-mass-destruction-systems\"&gt;Counter–Weapons of Mass Destruction Systems Group&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC's focus on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/impact/world-leader-interactive-supercomputing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;interactive supercomputing&lt;/a&gt; makes it especially useful to researchers. For years, the LLSC has pioneered software that lets users access its powerful systems without needing to be experts in configuring algorithms for parallel processing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The LLSC has always tried to make supercomputing feel like working on your laptop,\" Kepner says. \"The amount of data and the sophistication of analysis methods needed to be competitive today are well beyond what can be done on a laptop. But with our user-friendly approach, people can run their model and get answers quickly from their workspace.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond supporting programs solely at Lincoln Laboratory, TX-GAIN is enhancing research collaborations with MIT's campus. Such collaborations include the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.haystack.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Haystack Observatory&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cqe.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Quantum Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Beaver Works&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://aia.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Department of Air Force–MIT AI Accelerator.&lt;/a&gt; The latter initiative is rapidly prototyping, scaling, and applying AI technologies for the U.S. Air Force and Space Force,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/us-air-force-pilots-artificial-intelligence-assist-scheduling-aircrews-0708\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;optimizing flight scheduling&lt;/a&gt; for global operations as one fielded example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC systems are housed in an energy-efficient data center and facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Research staff in the LLSC are also tackling the immense&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/qa-vijay-gadepally-climate-impact-generative-ai\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;energy needs of AI&lt;/a&gt; and leading research into various&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/ai-models-are-devouring-energy-tools-reduce-consumption-are-here-if-data-centers-will-adopt\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;power-reduction methods&lt;/a&gt;. One software tool they developed can reduce the energy of training an AI model by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581784.3607034\"&gt;as much as 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The LLSC provides the capabilities needed to do leading-edge research, while in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner,\" Kepner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the supercomputers at the LLSC use the \"TX\" nomenclature in homage&amp;nbsp;to Lincoln Laboratory's Transistorized Experimental Computer Zero (TX-0) of 1956. TX-0 was one of the world's first transistor-based machines, and its 1958 successor,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/page/doc/2018-05/LookingBack_19_1.pdf\"&gt;TX-2&lt;/a&gt;, is storied for its role in pioneering human-computer interaction and AI.

While not all operations performed in a data center are AI-related, this total amount is slightly more than the energy consumption of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an August 2025 analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-ai-is-transforming-data-centers-and-ramping-up-power-demand\"&gt;global carbon emissions by about 220 million tons&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison, driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles produces about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics are staggering, but at the same time, scientists and engineers at MIT and around the world are studying innovations and interventions to mitigate AI’s ballooning carbon footprint, from boosting the efficiency of algorithms to rethinking the design of data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of reducing generative AI’s carbon footprint is typically centered on “operational carbon” — the emissions used by the powerful processors, known as GPUs, inside a data center. It often ignores “embodied carbon,” which are emissions created by building the data center in the first place, says Vijay Gadepally, senior scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who leads research projects in the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructing and retrofitting a data center, built from tons of steel and concrete and filled with air conditioning units, computing hardware, and miles of cable, consumes a huge amount of carbon. In fact, the environmental impact of building data centers is one reason companies like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.constructiondive.com/news/meta-piloting-mass-timber-for-sustainable-data-center-construction-clt-green-building/756919/\"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.esgdive.com/news/microsoft-swaps-concrete-steel-with-wood-in-data-centers-to-cut-emissions/731912/\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are exploring more sustainable building materials. (Cost is another factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, data centers are enormous buildings — the world’s largest, the China Telecomm-Inner Mongolia Information Park, engulfs&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://datacentremagazine.com/top10/top-10-biggest-data-centres\"&gt;roughly 10 million square feet&lt;/a&gt; — with about 10 to 50 times the energy density of a normal office building, Gadepally adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The operational side is only part of the story. Some things we are working on to reduce operational emissions may lend themselves to reducing embodied carbon, too, but we need to do more on that front in the future,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing operational carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures. For one, we can simply turn down the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have the worst lightbulbs in your house from an efficiency standpoint, turning them off or dimming them will always use less energy than leaving them running at full blast,” Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same fashion, research from the Supercomputing Center has shown that “turning down” the GPUs in a data center so they consume about &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/qa-vijay-gadepally-climate-impact-generative-ai-0113\"&gt;three-tenths the energy&lt;/a&gt; has minimal impacts on the performance of AI models, while also making the hardware easier to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to use less energy-intensive computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demanding generative AI workloads, such as training new reasoning models like GPT-5, usually need many GPUs working simultaneously. The Goldman Sachs analysis estimates that a state-of-the-art system could soon have as many as 576 connected GPUs operating at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But engineers can sometimes achieve similar results by reducing the precision of computing hardware, perhaps by switching to less powerful processors that have been tuned to handle a specific AI workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also measures that boost the efficiency of training power-hungry deep-learning models before they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gadepally’s group found that about half the electricity used for training an AI model is spent to get the last 2 or 3 percentage points in accuracy. Stopping the training process early can save a lot of that energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be cases where 70 percent accuracy is good enough for one particular application, like a recommender system for e-commerce,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also take advantage of efficiency-boosting measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a postdoc in the Supercomputing Center realized the group might run a thousand simulations during the training process to pick the two or three best AI models for their project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building a tool that allowed them to avoid about 80 percent of those wasted computing cycles, they dramatically reduced the energy demands of training with no reduction in model accuracy, Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging efficiency improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constant innovation in computing hardware, such as denser arrays of transistors on semiconductor chips, is still enabling dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though energy efficiency improvements have been slowing for most chips since about 2005, the amount of computation that GPUs can do per joule of energy has been improving by 50 to 60 percent each year, says Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a principal investigator at MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The still-ongoing ‘Moore’s Law’ trend of getting more and more transistors on chip still matters for a lot of these AI systems, since running operations in parallel is still very valuable for improving efficiency,” says Thomspon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significant, his group’s research indicates that efficiency gains from new model architectures that can solve complex problems faster, consuming less energy to achieve the same or better results, is doubling every eight or nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson coined the term “&lt;a href=\"https://ide.mit.edu/insights/the-importance-of-aigorithm-efficiency-can-nflops-hold-the-key-to-efficiency-gains/\"&gt;negaflop&lt;/a&gt;” to describe this effect. The same way a “negawatt” represents electricity saved due to energy-saving measures, a “negaflop” is a computing operation that doesn’t need to be performed due to algorithmic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could be things like “&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-techniques-efficiently-accelerate-sparse-tensors-1030\"&gt;pruning&lt;/a&gt;” away unnecessary components of a neural network or employing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2022/machine-learning-edge-microcontroller-1004\"&gt;compression techniques&lt;/a&gt; that enable users to do more with less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you need to use a really powerful model today to complete your task, in just a few years, you might be able to use a significantly smaller model to do the same thing, which would carry much less environmental burden. Making these models more efficient is the single-most important thing you can do to reduce the environmental costs of AI,” Thompson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing energy savings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reducing the overall energy use of AI algorithms and computing hardware will cut greenhouse gas emissions, not all energy is the same, Gadepally adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amount of carbon emissions in 1 kilowatt hour varies quite significantly, even just during the day, as well as over the month and year,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions. For instance, some generative AI workloads don’t need to be performed in their entirety at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting computing operations so some are performed later, when more of the electricity fed into the grid is from renewable sources like solar and wind, can go a long way toward reducing a data center’s carbon footprint, says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in the MIT Energy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deka and his team are also studying “smarter” data centers where the AI workloads of multiple companies using the same computing equipment are flexibly adjusted to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By looking at the system as a whole, our hope is to minimize energy use as well as dependence on fossil fuels, while still maintaining reliability standards for AI companies and users,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and others at MITEI are building a flexibility model of a data center that considers the differing energy demands of training a deep-learning model versus deploying that model. Their hope is to uncover the best strategies for scheduling and streamlining computing operations to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also exploring the use of long-duration energy storage units at data centers, which store excess energy for times when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these systems in place, a data center could use stored energy that was generated by renewable sources during a high-demand period, or avoid the use of diesel backup generators if there are fluctuations in the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-duration energy storage could be a game-changer here because we can design operations that really change the emission mix of the system to rely more on renewable energy,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers at MIT and Princeton University are developing a software tool for investment planning in the power sector, called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://energy.mit.edu/genx/\"&gt;GenX&lt;/a&gt;, which could be used to help companies determine the ideal place to locate a data center to minimize environmental impacts and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location can have a big impact on reducing a data center’s carbon footprint. For instance, Meta operates a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://datacenters.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Meta_s-Lulea-Data-Center.pdf\"&gt;data center in Lulea&lt;/a&gt;, a city on the coast of northern Sweden where cooler temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed to cool computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking farther outside the box (way farther), some governments are even exploring the construction of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-on-the-moon\"&gt;data centers on the moon&lt;/a&gt; where they could potentially be operated with nearly all renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-based solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the expansion of renewable energy generation here on Earth isn’t keeping pace with the rapid growth of AI, which is one major roadblock to reducing its carbon footprint, says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, a short-term lecturer, former Sloan Fellow, and former practice leader of climate and energy AI at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local, state, and federal review processes required for a new renewable energy projects can take years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are exploring the use of AI to speed up the process of connecting new renewable energy systems to the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a generative AI model could streamline interconnection studies that determine how a new project will impact the power grid, a step that often takes years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to &lt;a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128\"&gt;accelerating the development and implementation of clean energy technologies&lt;/a&gt;, AI could play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is great for tackling complex situations, and the electrical grid is said to be one of the largest and most complex machines in the world,” Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI could help optimize the prediction of solar and wind energy generation or identify ideal locations for new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also be used to perform predictive maintenance and fault detection for solar panels or other green energy infrastructure, or to monitor the capacity of transmission wires to maximize efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By helping researchers gather and analyze huge amounts of data, AI could also inform targeted policy interventions aimed at getting the biggest “bang for the buck” from areas such as renewable energy, Turliuk says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score is a framework that can be used to help determine the net climate impact of AI projects, considering emissions and other environmental costs along with potential environmental benefits in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the most effective solutions will likely result from collaborations among companies, regulators, and researchers, with academia leading the way, Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day counts. We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT_AI-Climate-01.jpg?itok=--5jq5Ns\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it,” says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, who is working to help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of generative AI. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense.”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainable-computing\">Sustainable computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/supercomputing\">Supercomputing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy-storage\">Energy storage</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/infrastructure\">Infrastructure</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-energy-initiative\">MIT Energy Initiative</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lincoln-laboratory-0\">Lincoln Laboratory</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>AI system learns from many types of scientific information and runs experiments to discover new materials</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-system-learns-many-types-scientific-information-and-runs-experiments-discovering-new-materials-0925</link>\n  <description>The new “CRESt” platform could help find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-system-learns-many-types-scientific-information-and-runs-experiments-discovering-new-materials-0925</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine-learning models can speed up the discovery of new materials by making predictions and suggesting experiments. But most models today only consider a few specific types of data or variables. Compare that with human scientists, who work in a collaborative environment and consider experimental results, the broader scientific literature, imaging and structural analysis, personal experience or intuition, and input from colleagues and peer reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a method for optimizing materials recipes and planning experiments that incorporates information from diverse sources like insights from the literature, chemical compositions, microstructural images, and more. The approach is part of a new platform, named Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), that also uses robotic equipment for high-throughput materials testing, the results of which are fed back into large multimodal models to further optimize materials recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human researchers can converse with the system in natural language, with no coding required, and the system makes its own observations and hypotheses along the way. Cameras and visual language models also allow the system to monitor experiments, detect issues, and suggest corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the field of AI for science, the key is designing new experiments,” says Ju Li, School of Engineering Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. “We use multimodal feedback — for example information from previous literature on how palladium behaved in fuel cells at this temperature, and human feedback — to complement experimental data and design new experiments. We also use robots to synthesize and characterize the material’s structure and to test performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is described in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09640-5\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers used CRESt to explore more than 900 chemistries and conduct 3,500 electrochemical tests, leading to the discovery of a catalyst material that delivered record power density in a fuel cell that runs on formate salt to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Li on the paper as first authors are&amp;nbsp;PhD student Zhen Zhang, Zhichu Ren PhD ’24, PhD student Chia-Wei Hsu, and postdoc&amp;nbsp;Weibin Chen. Their coauthors are MIT Assistant Professor Iwnetim Abate; Associate Professor Pulkit Agrawal; JR East Professor of Engineering Yang Shao-Horn; MIT.nano researcher Aubrey Penn; Zhang-Wei Hong PhD ’25, Hongbin Xu PhD ’25; Daniel Zheng PhD ’25; MIT graduate students Shuhan Miao and Hugh Smith; MIT postdocs Yimeng Huang, Weiyin Chen, Yungsheng Tian, Yifan Gao, and Yaoshen Niu; former MIT postdoc Sipei Li; and collaborators including Chi-Feng Lee, Yu-Cheng Shao, Hsiao-Tsu Wang, and Ying-Rui Lu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A smarter system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can be time-consuming and expensive. They require researchers to carefully design workflows, make new material, and run a series of tests and analysis to understand what happened. Those results are then used to decide how to improve the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve the process, some researchers have turned to a machine-learning strategy known as active learning to make efficient use of previous experimental data points and explore or exploit those data. When paired with a statistical technique known as Bayesian optimization (BO), active learning has helped researchers identify new materials for things like batteries and advanced semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bayesian optimization is like Netflix recommending the next movie to watch based on your viewing history, except instead it recommends the next experiment to do,” Li explains. “But basic Bayesian optimization is too simplistic. It uses a boxed-in design space, so if I say I’m going to use platinum, palladium, and iron, it only changes the ratio of those elements in this small space. But real materials have a lot more dependencies, and BO often gets lost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most active learning approaches also rely on single data streams that don’t capture everything that goes on in an experiment. To equip computational systems with more human-like knowledge, while still taking advantage of the speed and control of automated systems, Li and his collaborators built CRESt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRESt’s robotic equipment includes a liquid-handling robot, a carbothermal shock system to rapidly synthesize materials, an automated electrochemical workstation for testing, characterization equipment including automated electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and auxiliary devices such as pumps and gas valves, which can also be remotely controlled.&amp;nbsp; Many processing parameters can also be tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the user interface, researchers can chat with CRESt and tell it to use active learning to find promising materials recipes for different projects. CRESt can include up to 20 precursor molecules and substrates into its recipe. To guide material designs, CRESt’s models search through scientific papers for descriptions of elements or precursor molecules that might be useful. When human researchers tell CRESt to pursue new recipes, it kicks off a robotic symphony of sample preparation, characterization, and testing. The researcher can also ask CRESt to perform image analysis from scanning electron microscopy imaging, X-ray diffraction, and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information from those processes is used to train the active learning models, which use both literature knowledge and current experimental results to suggest further experiments and accelerate materials discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For each recipe we use previous literature text or databases, and it creates these huge representations of every recipe based on the previous knowledge base before even doing the experiment,” says Li. “We perform principal component analysis in this knowledge embedding space to get a reduced search space that captures most of the performance variability. Then we use Bayesian optimization in this reduced space to design the new experiment. After the new experiment, we feed newly acquired multimodal experimental data and human feedback into a large language model to augment the knowledgebase and redefine the reduced search space, which gives us a big boost in active learning efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can also face reproducibility challenges. To address the problem, CRESt monitors its experiments with cameras, looking for potential problems and suggesting solutions via text and voice to human researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used CRESt to develop an electrode material for an advanced type of high-density fuel cell known as a direct formate fuel cell. After exploring more than 900 chemistries over three months, CRESt discovered a catalyst material made from eight elements that achieved a 9.3-fold improvement in power density per dollar over pure palladium, an expensive precious metal. In further tests, CRESTs material was used to deliver a record power density to a working direct formate fuel cell even though the cell contained just one-fourth of the precious metals of previous devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show the potential for CRESt to find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A significant challenge for fuel-cell catalysts is the use of precious metal,” says Zhang. “For fuel cells, researchers have used various precious metals like palladium and platinum. We used a multielement catalyst that also incorporates many other cheap elements to create the optimal coordination environment for catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning species such as carbon monoxide and adsorbed hydrogen atom. People have been searching low-cost options for many years. This system greatly accelerated our search for these catalysts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A helpful assistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, poor reproducibility emerged as a major problem that limited the researchers’ ability to perform their new active learning technique on experimental datasets. Material properties can be influenced by the way the precursors are mixed and processed, and any number of problems can subtly alter experimental conditions, requiring careful inspection to correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To partially automate the process, the researchers coupled computer vision and vision language models with domain knowledge from the scientific literature, which allowed the system to hypothesize sources of irreproducibility and propose solutions. For example, the models can notice when there’s a millimeter-sized deviation in a sample’s shape or when a pipette moves something out of place. The researchers incorporated some of the model’s suggestions, leading to improved consistency, suggesting the models already make good experimental assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that humans still performed most of the debugging in their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CREST is an assistant, not a replacement, for human researchers,” Li says. “Human researchers are still indispensable. In fact, we use natural language so the system can explain what it is doing and present observations and hypotheses. But this is a step toward more flexible, self-driving labs.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Crest-01-press.jpg?itok=7kYJbO5h\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The CRESt user interface allows researchers to chat with the platform and tell it to deliver promising material recipes, start sample preparation, or perform image analysis on SEM images.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; figures courtesy of the researchers; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/materialsscienceandengineering\">Materials science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nanotech\">Nanoscience and nanotechnology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dmse\">DMSE</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitnano\">MIT.nano</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New AI system could accelerate clinical research</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925</link>\n  <description>By enabling rapid annotation of areas of interest in medical images, the tool can help scientists study new treatments or map disease progression.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Annotating regions of interest in medical images, a process known as segmentation, is often one of the first steps clinical researchers take when running a new study involving biomedical images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, to determine how the size of the brain’s hippocampus changes as patients age, the scientist first outlines each hippocampus in a series of brain scans. For many structures and image types, this is often a manual process that can be extremely time-consuming, especially if the regions being studied are challenging to delineate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To streamline the process, MIT researchers developed an artificial intelligence-based system that enables a researcher to rapidly segment new biomedical imaging datasets by clicking, scribbling, and drawing boxes on the images. This new AI model uses these interactions to predict the segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the user marks additional images, the number of interactions they need to perform decreases, eventually dropping to zero. The model can then segment each new image accurately without user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can do this because the model’s architecture has been specially designed to use information from images it has already segmented to make new predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other medical image segmentation models, this system allows the user to segment an entire dataset without repeating their work for each image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the interactive tool does not require a presegmented image dataset for training, so users don’t need machine-learning expertise or extensive computational resources. They can use the system for a new segmentation task without retraining the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, this tool could accelerate studies of new treatment methods and reduce the cost of clinical trials and medical research. It could also be used by physicians to improve the efficiency of clinical applications, such as radiation treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many scientists might only have time to segment a few images per day for their research because manual image segmentation is so time-consuming. Our hope is that this system will enable new science by allowing clinical researchers to conduct studies they were prohibited from doing before because of the lack of an efficient tool,” says Hallee Wong, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student and lead author of a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15058\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper on this new tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz PhD ’24; John Guttag, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; and senior author Adrian Dalca, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and MGH, and a research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The research will be presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlining segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are primarily two methods researchers use to segment new sets of medical images. With interactive segmentation, they input an image into an AI system and use an interface to mark areas of interest. The model predicts the segmentation based on those interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tool previously developed by the MIT researchers,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/scribbleprompt-helping-doctors-annotate-medical-scans-0909\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ScribblePrompt&lt;/a&gt;, allows users to do this, but they must repeat the process for each new image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to develop a task-specific AI model to automatically segment the images. This approach requires the user to manually segment hundreds of images to create a dataset, and then train a machine-learning model. That model predicts the segmentation for a new image. But the user must start the complex, machine-learning-based process from scratch for each new task, and there is no way to correct the model if it makes a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new system,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://multiverseg.csail.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;MultiverSeg&lt;/a&gt;, combines the best of each approach. It predicts a segmentation for a new image based on user interactions, like scribbles, but also keeps each segmented image in a context set that it refers to later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the user uploads a new image and marks areas of interest, the model draws on the examples in its context set to make a more accurate prediction, with less user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed the model’s architecture to use a context set of any size, so&amp;nbsp;the user doesn’t need to have a certain number of images. This gives MultiverSeg the flexibility to be used in a range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, for many tasks, you shouldn’t need to provide any interactions. If you have enough examples in the context set, the model can accurately predict the segmentation on its own,” Wong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers carefully engineered and trained the model on a diverse collection of biomedical imaging data to ensure it had the ability to incrementally improve its predictions based on user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user doesn’t need to retrain or customize the model for their data. To use MultiverSeg for a new task, one can upload a new medical image and start marking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers compared MultiverSeg to state-of-the-art tools for in-context and interactive image segmentation, it outperformed each baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer clicks, better results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike these other tools, MultiverSeg requires less user input with each image. By the ninth new image, it needed only two clicks from the user to generate a segmentation more accurate than a model designed specifically for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some image types, like X-rays, the user might only need to segment one or two images manually before the model becomes accurate enough to make predictions on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool’s interactivity also enables the user to make corrections to the model’s prediction, iterating until it reaches the desired level of accuracy. Compared to the researchers’ previous system, MultiverSeg reached 90 percent accuracy with roughly 2/3 the number of scribbles and 3/4 the number of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With MultiverSeg, users can always provide more interactions to refine the AI predictions. This still dramatically accelerates the process because it is usually faster to correct something that exists than to start from scratch,” Wong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers want to test this tool in real-world situations with clinical collaborators and improve it based on user feedback. They also want to enable MultiverSeg to segment 3D biomedical images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is supported, in part, by Quanta Computer, Inc. and the National Institutes of Health, with hardware support from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Scalable-Segmentation-01.jpg?itok=JP7l2Ede\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT researchers have developed a new AI-based tool that rapidly annotates areas of interest in medical images and can help in the study of new treatments or map disease progression.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/imaging\">Imaging</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health-care\">Health care</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Improving the workplace of the future</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/improving-workplace-future-whitney-zhang-0924</link>\n  <description>Economics doctoral student Whitney Zhang investigates how technologies and organizational decisions shape labor markets.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/improving-workplace-future-whitney-zhang-0924</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Benjamin Daniel | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Whitney Zhang ’21 believes in the importance of valuing workers regardless of where they fit into an organizational chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang is a PhD student in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/\"&gt;Department of Economics&lt;/a&gt; studying labor economics. She explores how the technological and managerial decisions companies make affect workers across the pay spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“I’ve been interested in economics, economic impacts, and related social issues for a long time,” says Zhang, who majored in mathematical economics as an undergraduate. “I wanted to apply my math skills to see how we could improve policies and their effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang is interested in how to improve conditions for workers. She believes it’s important to build relationships with policymakers, focusing on an evidence-driven approach to policy, while always remembering to center those the policies may affect. “We have to remember the people whose lives are impacted by business operations and legislation,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;She’s also aware of the complex intermixture of politics, social status, and financial obligations organizations and their employees have to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Though I’m studying workers, it’s important to consider the entire complex ecosystem when solving for these kinds of challenges, including firm incentives and global economic conditions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intersection of tech and labor policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang began investigating employee productivity, artificial intelligence, and related economic and labor market phenomena early in her time as a doctoral student, collaborating frequently with fellow PhD students in the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;A collaboration with economics doctoral student Shakked Noy yielded the 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating ChatGPT as a tool to improve productivity. Their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/study-finds-chatgpt-boosts-worker-productivity-writing-0714\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found it substantially increased workers’ productivity on writing tasks, most so for workers who initially performed the worst on the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This was one of the earliest pieces of evidence on the productivity effects of generative AI, and contributed to providing concrete data on how impactful these types of tools might be in the workplace and on the labor market,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In other ongoing research&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;“Determinants of Irregular Worker Schedules” —&amp;nbsp;Zhang is using data from a payroll provider to examine scheduling unpredictability, investigating why companies employ unpredictable schedules and how these schedules affect low-wage employees’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The scheduling project, conducted with MIT economics PhD student Nathan Lazarus, is motivated, in part, by existing sociological evidence that low-wage workers’ unpredictable schedules are associated with worse sleep and well-being. “We’ve seen a relationship between higher turnover and inconsistent, inadequate schedules, which suggests workers dis-prefer these kinds of schedules,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;At an academic roundtable, Zhang presented her results to Starbucks employees involved in scheduling and staffing. The attendees wanted to learn more about how different scheduling practices impacted workers and their productivity. “These are the kinds of questions that could reveal useful information for small businesses, large corporations, and others,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;By conducting this research, Zhang hopes to better understand whether or not scheduling regulations can improve affected employees’ quality of life, while also considering potential unintended consequences. “Why are these schedules set the way they’re set?” she asks. “Do businesses with these kinds of schedules require increased regulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Another project, conducted with MIT economics doctoral student Arjun Ramani, examines the linkages between offshoring, remote work, and related outcomes. “Do the technological and managerial practices that have made remote work possible further facilitate offshoring?” she asks. “Do organizations see significant gains in efficiency? What are the impacts on U.S. and offshore workers?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Her work is being funded through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program\"&gt;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://equitablegrowth.org/equitable-growth-awards-funding-to-early-career-scholars-studying-the-effects-of-economic-inequality/\"&gt;Washington Center for Equitable Growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting people at the center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang has observed the different kinds of people economics and higher education could bring together. She followed a dual enrollment track in high school, completing college-level courses with students from across a variety of demographic identities. “I enjoyed centering people in my work,” she says. “Taking classes with a diverse group of students, including veterans and mothers returning to school to complete their studies, made me more curious about socioeconomic issues and the policies relevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;She later enrolled at MIT, where she participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (&lt;a href=\"https://urop.mit.edu/\"&gt;UROP&lt;/a&gt;). She also completed an internship at the World Bank, worked as a summer analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and worked as an assistant for a diverse faculty cohort including MIT economists&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/david-h-autor\"&gt;David Autor&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-gruber\"&gt;Jon Gruber&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nina-roussille\"&gt;Nina Roussille&lt;/a&gt;. Autor is her primary advisor on her doctoral research, a mentor she cites as a significant influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“[Autor’s] course, 14.03 (Microeconomics and Public Policy), cemented connections between theory and practice,” she says. “I thought the class was revelatory in showing the kinds of questions economics can answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Doctoral study has revealed interesting pathways of investigation for Zhang, as have her relationships with her student peers and other faculty. She has, for example, leveraged faculty connections to gain access to hourly wage data in support of her scheduling and employee impacts work. “Generally, economists have had administrative data on earnings, but not on hours,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang’s focus on improving others’ lives extends to her work outside the classroom. She’s a mentor for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bcnc.net/find-a-program/child-and-youth-services/youth-program/\"&gt;Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center College Access Program&lt;/a&gt; and a member of MIT’s Graduate Christian Fellowship group. When she’s not enjoying spicy soups or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://harvarddb.com/\"&gt;paddling&lt;/a&gt; on the Charles, she takes advantage of opportunities to decompress with her art at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://arts.mit.edu/start/studios/\"&gt;W20 Arts Studios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“I wanted to create time for myself outside of research and the classroom,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang cites the benefits of MIT’s focus on cross-collaboration and encouraging students to explore other disciplines. As an undergraduate, Zhang minored in computer science, which taught her coding skills critical to her data work. Exposure to engineering also led her to become more interested in questions around how technology and workers interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Working with other scholars in the department has improved how Zhang conducts inquiries. “I’ve become the kind of well-rounded student and professional who can identify and quantify impacts, which is invaluable for future projects,” she says. Exposure to different academic and research areas, Zhang argues, helps increase access to ideas and information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-Whitney-Zhang.jpg?itok=2XIoq8ag\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“I’ve been interested in economics, economic impacts, and related social issues for a long time,” says Whitney Zhang.

With AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), the barrier to entry for these formal tools is dropping rapidly, making formal verification frameworks accessible to working mathematicians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathlib is a large, community-driven mathematical library for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" title=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" data-outlook-id=\"aec284c5-6738-43e8-a293-7ec08de2a2e8\"&gt;Lean&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;theorem prover, a formal system that verifies the correctness of every step in a proof.&amp;nbsp;Mathlib currently contains on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; mathematical results (such as lemmas, propositions, and theorems). The LMFDB,&amp;nbsp;a massive, collaborative online resource that serves as a kind of “encyclopedia” of modern number theory,&amp;nbsp;contains more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concrete statements.&amp;nbsp;Sutherland&amp;nbsp;and Roe are managing editors of the LMFDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roe and Sutherland’s grant will be used for a&amp;nbsp;project that aims to augment both systems, making the LMFDB’s results available within mathlib as assertions that have not yet been formally proved, and providing precise formal definitions of the numerical data stored within the LMFDB. This bridge will benefit both human mathematicians and AI agents, and provide a framework for connecting other mathematical databases to formal theorem-proving systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main obstacles to automating mathematical discovery and proof are the limited amount of formalized math knowledge, the high cost of formalizing complex results, and the gap between what is computationally accessible and what is feasible to formalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these obstacles, the researchers will use the funding to build tools for accessing the LMFDB from mathlib, making a large database of unformalized mathematical knowledge accessible to a formal proof system. This approach enables proof assistants to identify specific targets for formalization without the need to formalize the entire LMFDB corpus in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a large database of unformalized number-theoretic facts available within mathlib will provide a powerful technique for mathematical discovery, because the set of facts an agent might wish to consider while searching for a theorem or proof is exponentially larger than the set of facts that eventually need to be formalized in actually proving the theorem,” says Roe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that proving new theorems at the frontier of mathematical knowledge often&amp;nbsp;involves steps that rely on a nontrivial computation. For example, Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem uses what is known as the “3-5 trick” at a crucial point in the proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trick depends on the fact that the modular curve X_0(15) has only finitely many rational points, and none of those rational points correspond to a semi-stable elliptic curve,” according to&amp;nbsp;Sutherland. “This fact was known well before Wiles’ work, and is easy to verify using computational tools available in modern computer algebra systems, but it is not something one can realistically prove using pencil and paper, nor is it necessarily easy to formalize.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While formal theorem provers are being connected to computer algebra systems for more efficient verification, tapping into computational outputs in existing mathematical databases offers several other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stored results leverages the thousands of CPU-years of computation time already spent in creating the LMFDB, saving money that would be needed to redo these computations. Having precomputed information available also makes it feasible to search for examples or counterexamples without knowing ahead of time how broad the search can be. In addition, mathematical databases are curated repositories, not simply a random collection of facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that number theorists emphasized the role of the conductor in databases of elliptic curves has already proved to be crucial to one notable mathematical discovery made using machine learning tools:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/\" title=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/\" data-outlook-id=\"05d200f2-ffa0-4277-92e5-3fcf85b00cb9\"&gt;murmurations&lt;/a&gt;,” says&amp;nbsp;Sutherland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next steps are to build a team, engage with both the LMFDB and mathlib communities, start to formalize the definitions that underpin the elliptic curve, number field, and modular form sections of the LMFDB, and make it possible to run LMFDB searches from within mathlib,” says Roe. “If you are an MIT student interested in getting involved, feel free to reach out!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-mathematics-roe-sutherland.jpg?itok=GaIs7BPh\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Department of Mathematics researchers David Roe (left) and Andrew Sutherland</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Sandi Miller</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/awards\">Awards, honors and fellowships</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/funding\">Funding</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/staff\">Staff</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New tool makes generative AI models more likely to create breakthrough materials</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922</link>\n  <description>With SCIGEN, researchers can steer AI models to create materials with exotic properties for applications like quantum computing.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence models that turn text into images are also useful for generating new materials. Over the last few years, generative materials models from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have drawn on their training data to help researchers design tens of millions of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to designing materials with exotic quantum properties like superconductivity or unique magnetic states, those models struggle. That’s too bad, because humans could use the help. For example, after a decade of research into a class of materials that could revolutionize quantum computing, called quantum spin liquids, only a dozen material candidates have been identified. The bottleneck means there are fewer materials to serve as the basis for technological breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a technique that lets popular generative materials models create promising quantum materials by following specific design rules. The rules, or constraints, steer models to create materials with unique structures that give rise to quantum properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The models from these large companies generate materials optimized for stability,” says Mingda Li, MIT’s Class of 1947 Career Development Professor. “Our perspective is that’s not usually how materials science advances. We don’t need 10 million new materials to change the world. We just need one really good material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is described today in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02355-y\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published by &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties. From that pool, they synthesized two actual materials with exotic magnetic traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People in the quantum community really care about these geometric constraints, like the Kagome lattices that are two overlapping, upside-down triangles. We created materials with Kagome lattices because those materials can mimic the behavior of rare earth elements, so they are of high technical importance.” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li is the senior author of the paper. His MIT co-authors include PhD students Ryotaro Okabe,&amp;nbsp;Mouyang Cheng, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, and Denisse Cordova Carrizales; postdoc Manasi Mandal; undergraduate researchers Kiran Mak and Bowen Yu; visiting scholar Nguyen Tuan Hung; Xiang Fu ’22, PhD ’24; and professor of electrical engineering and computer science Tommi Jaakkola, who is an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. Additional co-authors include Yao Wang of Emory University, Weiwei Xie of Michigan State University, YQ Cheng of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Robert Cava of Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steering models toward impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A material’s properties are determined by its structure, and quantum materials are no different. Certain atomic structures are more likely to give rise to exotic quantum properties than others. For instance, square lattices can serve as a platform for high-temperature superconductors, while other shapes known as Kagome and Lieb lattices can support the creation of materials that could be useful for quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help a popular class of generative models known as a diffusion models produce materials that conform to particular geometric patterns, the researchers created SCIGEN (short for Structural Constraint Integration in GENerative model). SCIGEN is a computer code that ensures diffusion models adhere to user-defined constraints at each iterative generation step. With SCIGEN, users can give any generative AI diffusion model geometric structural rules to follow as it generates materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI diffusion models work by sampling from their training dataset to generate structures that reflect the distribution of structures found in the dataset. SCIGEN blocks generations that don’t align with the structural rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test SCIGEN, the researchers applied it to a popular AI materials generation model known as DiffCSP. They had the SCIGEN-equipped model generate materials with unique geometric patterns known as Archimedean lattices, which are collections of 2D lattice tilings of different polygons. Archimedean lattices can lead to a range of quantum phenomena and have been the focus of much research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Archimedean lattices give rise to quantum spin liquids and so-called flat bands, which can mimic the properties of rare earths without rare earth elements, so they are extremely important,” says Cheng, a co-corresponding author of the work. “Other Archimedean lattice materials have large pores that could be used for carbon capture and other applications, so it’s a collection of special materials. In some cases, there are no known materials with that lattice, so I think it will be really interesting to find the first material that fits in that lattice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model generated over 10 million material candidates with Archimedean lattices. One million of those materials survived a screening for stability. Using the supercomputers in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the researchers then took a smaller sample of 26,000 materials and ran detailed simulations to understand how the materials’ underlying atoms behaved. The researchers found magnetism in 41 percent of those structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that subset, the researchers synthesized two previously undiscovered compounds, TiPdBi and TiPbSb, at Xie and Cava’s labs. Subsequent experiments showed the AI model’s predictions largely aligned with the actual material’s properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to discover new materials that could have a huge potential impact by incorporating these structures that have been known to give rise to quantum properties,” says Okabe, the paper’s first author. “We already know that these materials with specific geometric patterns are interesting, so it’s natural to start with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating material breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum spin liquids could unlock quantum computing by enabling stable, error-resistant qubits that serve as the basis of quantum operations. But no quantum spin liquid materials have been confirmed. Xie and Cava believe SCIGEN could accelerate the search for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big search for quantum computer materials and topological superconductors, and these are all related to the geometric patterns of materials,” Xie says. “But experimental progress has been very, very slow,” Cava adds. “Many of these quantum spin liquid materials are subject to constraints: They have to be in a triangular lattice or a Kagome lattice. If the materials satisfy those constraints, the quantum researchers get excited; it’s a necessary but not sufficient condition. So, by generating many, many materials like that, it immediately gives experimentalists hundreds or thousands more candidates to play with to accelerate quantum computer materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work presents a new tool, leveraging machine learning, that can predict which materials will have specific elements in a desired geometric pattern,” says Drexel University Professor Steve May, who was not involved in the research. “This should speed up the development of previously unexplored materials for applications in next-generation electronic, magnetic, or optical technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that experimentation is still critical to assess whether AI-generated materials can be synthesized and how their actual properties compare with model predictions. Future work on SCIGEN could incorporate additional design rules into generative models, including chemical and functional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who want to change the world care about material properties more than the stability and structure of materials,” Okabe says. “With our approach, the ratio of stable materials goes down, but it opens the door to generate a whole bunch of promising materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the National Science Foundation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-genmaterial-01-press.jpg?itok=3ST3EvZG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties.

Over the last few years, no technology has changed that craft more than artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are predicting a rapid and complete transformation in how startups are built, the Trust Center’s leaders have a more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fundamentals of entrepreneurship haven’t changed with AI,” says Trust Center Entrepreneur in Residence Macauley Kenney. “There’s been a shift in how entrepreneurs accomplish tasks, and that trickles down into how you build a company, but we’re thinking of AI as another new tool in the toolkit. In some ways the world is moving a lot faster, but we also need to make sure the fundamental principles of entrepreneurship are well-understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach was on display during this summer’s delta v startup accelerator program, where many students regularly turned to AI tools but still ultimately relied on talking to their customers to make the right decisions for their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in this year’s cohort used AI tools to accelerate their coding, draft presentations, learn about new industries, and brainstorm ideas. The Trust Center is encouraging students to use AI as they see fit while also staying mindful of the technology’s limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center itself has also embraced AI, most notably through Jetpack, its generative AI app that walks users through the 24 steps of disciplined entrepreneurship outlined in Managing Director Bill Aulet’s &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2013/disciplined-entrepreneurship-bill-aulet-0826\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. When students input a startup idea, the tool can suggest customer segments, early markets to pursue, business models, pricing, and a product plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways the Trust Center wants students to use Jetpack is apparent in its name: It’s inspired by the acceleration a jetpack provides, but users still need to guide its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with AI technology’s current limitations, the Trust Center’s leaders acknowledge it can be a powerful tool for people at any stage of building a business, and their use of AI will continue to evolve with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s undeniable we’re in the midst of an AI revolution right now,” says Entrepreneur in Residence Ben Soltoff. “AI is reshaping a lot of things we do, and it’s also shaping how we do entrepreneurship and how students build companies. The Trust Center has recognized that for years, and we’ve welcomed AI into how we teach entrepreneurship at all levels, from the earliest stages of idea formation to exploring and testing those ideas and understanding how to commercialize and scale them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI’s strengths and weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, when the Trust Center’s delta v staff get together for strategic retreats, AI has been a central topic. The delta v program’s organizers think about how students can get the most out of the technology each year as they plan their summer-long curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with Orbit, the mobile app designed to help students find entrepreneurial resources, network with peers, access mentorship, and identify events and jobs. Jetpack was added to Orbit last year. It is trained on Aulet’s “Disciplined Entrepreneurship” as well as former Trust Center Executive Director Paul Cheek’s “&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-paul-cheek-startup-tactics-book-0503\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Startup Tactics&lt;/a&gt;” book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center describes Jetpack’s outputs as first drafts designed to help students brainstorm their next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to verify everything when you are using AI to build a business,” says Kenney, who is also a lecturer at MIT Sloan and MIT D-Lab. “I have yet to meet anyone who will base their business on the output of something like ChatGPT without verifying everything first. Sometimes, the verification can take longer than if you had done the research yourself from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company in this year’s cohort, Mendhai Health, uses AI and telehealth to offer personalized physical therapy for women struggling with pelvic floor dysfunction before and after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI has definitely made the entrepreneurial process more efficient and faster,” says MBA student Aanchal Arora. “Still, overreliance on AI, at least at this point, can hamper your understanding of customers. You need to be careful with every decision you make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney notes the way large language models are built can make them less useful for entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some AI tools can increase your speed by doing things like automatically sorting your email or helping you vibe code apps, but many AI tools are built off averages, and those can be less effective when you’re trying to connect with a very specific demographic,” Kenney says. “It’s not helpful to have AI tell you about an average person, you need to personally have strong validation that your specific customer exists. If you try to build a tool for an average person, you may build a tool for no one at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students eager to embrace AI may also be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tools available today. Fortunately, MIT students have a long history of being at the forefront of any new technology, and this year’s delta v cohort featured teams leveraging AI at the core of their solutions and in every step of their entrepreneurial journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Sloan MBA candidate Murtaza Jameel, whose company Cognify uses AI to simulates user interactions with websites and apps to improve digital experiences, describes his firm as an AI-native business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re building a design intelligence tool that replaces product testing with instant, predictive simulations of user behavior,” Jameel explains. “We’re trying to integrate AI into all of our processes: ideation, go to market, programming. All of our building has been done with AI coding tools. I have a custom bot that I’ve fed tons of information about our company to, and it’s a thought partner I’m speaking to every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more things change…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamentals the Trust Center doesn’t see changing is the need for students to get out of the lab or the classroom to talk to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are ways that AI can unlock new capabilities and make things move faster, but we haven’t turned our curriculum on its head because of AI,” Soltoff says. “In delta v, we stress first and foremost: What are you building and who are you building it for? AI alone can’t tell you who your customer is, what they want, and how you can better serve their needs. You need to go out into the world to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many of the biggest hurdles delta v teams faced this summer looked a lot like the hurdles entrepreneurs have always faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were prepared at the Trust Center to see a big change and to adapt to that, but the companies are still building and encountering the same challenges of customer identification, beachhead market identification, team dynamics,” Kenney says. “Those are still the big meaty challenges they’ve always been working on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid endless hype about AI agents and the future of work, many founders this summer still said the human side of delta v is what makes the program special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came to MIT with one goal: to start a technology company,” Jameel says. “The delta v program was on my radar when I was applying to MIT. The program gives you incredible access to resources — networks, mentorship, advisors. Some of the top folks in our industry are advising us now on how to build our company. It’s really unique. These are folks who have done what you’re doing 10 or 20 years ago, all just rooting for you. That’s why I came to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Entrepreneurs-01-press.jpg?itok=WovQMRvc\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The 2025 delta v accelerator cohort poses on stage for a group photo at the delta v demo day.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the Martin Trust Center</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/business\">Business and management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/martin-trust-center-mit-entrepreneurship\">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>What does the future hold for generative AI?</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919</link>\n  <description>At the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium Symposium, researchers and business leaders discussed potential advancements centered on this powerful technology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world in 2022, it brought generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and started a snowball effect that led to its rapid integration into industry, scientific research, health care, and the everyday lives of people who use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes next for this powerful but imperfect tool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that question in mind, hundreds of researchers, business leaders, educators, and students gathered at MIT’s Kresge Auditorium for the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium (MGAIC) Symposium on Sept. 17 to share insights and discuss the potential future of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal moment — generative AI is moving fast. It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/introducing-mit-generative-ai-impact-consortium-0203\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;consortium&lt;/a&gt; of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT_MGAIC_01-press.jpg?itok=RAAJ5NOt\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: Gretchen Ertl</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/special-events\">Special events and guest speakers</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/robotics\">Robotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/industry\">Industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/president-sally-kornbluth\">President Sally Kornbluth</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/provost\">Provost</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>How to build AI scaling laws for efficient LLM training and budget maximization</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-build-ai-scaling-laws-efficient-llm-training-budget-maximization-0916</link>\n  <description>MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers have developed a universal guide for estimating how large language models will perform based on smaller models in the same family.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-build-ai-scaling-laws-efficient-llm-training-budget-maximization-0916</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Lauren Hinkel | MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When researchers are building large language models (LLMs), they aim to maximize performance under a particular computational and financial budget. Since training a model can amount to millions of dollars, developers need to be judicious with cost-impacting decisions about, for instance, the model architecture, optimizers, and training datasets before committing to a model. To anticipate the quality and accuracy of a large model’s predictions, practitioners often turn to scaling laws: using smaller, cheaper models to try to approximate the performance of a much larger target model. The challenge, however, is that there are thousands of ways to create a scaling law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work from MIT and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers addresses this by amassing and releasing a collection of hundreds of models and metrics concerning training and performance to approximate more than a thousand scaling laws. From this, the team developed a meta-analysis and guide for how to select small models and estimate scaling laws for different LLM model families, so that the budget is optimally applied toward generating reliable performance predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The notion that you might want to try to build mathematical models of the training process is a couple of years old, but I think what was new here is that most of the work that people had been doing before is saying, ‘can we say something post-hoc about what happened when we trained all of these models, so that when we’re trying to figure out how to train a new large-scale model, we can make the best decisions about how to use our compute budget?’” says Jacob Andreas, associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and principal investigator with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning by Andreas, along with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers Leshem Choshen and Yang Zhang of IBM Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrapolating performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how you slice it, developing LLMs is an expensive endeavor: from decision-making regarding the numbers of parameters and tokens, data selection and size, and training techniques to determining output accuracy and tuning to the target applications and tasks. Scaling laws offer a way to forecast model behavior by relating a large model’s loss to the performance of smaller, less-costly models from the same family, avoiding the need to fully train every candidate. Mainly, the differences between the smaller models are the number of parameters and token training size. According to Choshen, elucidating scaling laws not only enable better pre-training decisions, but also democratize the field by enabling researchers without vast resources to understand and build effective scaling laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functional form of scaling laws is relatively simple, incorporating components from the small models that capture the number of parameters and their scaling effect, the number of training tokens and their scaling effect, and the baseline performance for the model family of interest. Together, they help researchers estimate a target large model’s performance loss; the smaller the loss, the better the target model’s outputs are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These laws allow research teams to weigh trade-offs efficiently and to test how best to allocate limited resources. They’re particularly useful for evaluating scaling of a certain variable, like the number of tokens, and for A/B testing of different pre-training setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, scaling laws aren’t new; however, in the field of AI, they emerged as models grew and costs skyrocketed. “It’s like scaling laws just appeared at some point in the field,” says Choshen. “They started getting attention, but no one really tested how good they are and what you need to do to make a good scaling law.” Further, scaling laws were themselves also a black box, in a sense. “Whenever people have created scaling laws in the past, it has always just been one model, or one model family, and one dataset, and one developer,” says Andreas. “There hadn’t really been a lot of systematic meta-analysis, as everybody is individually training their own scaling laws. So, [we wanted to know,] are there high-level trends that you see across those things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, Choshen, Andreas, and Zhang created a large dataset. They collected LLMs from 40 model families, including Pythia, OPT, OLMO, LLaMA, Bloom, T5-Pile, ModuleFormer mixture-of-experts, GPT, and other families. These included 485 unique, pre-trained models, and where available, data about their training checkpoints, computational cost (FLOPs), training epochs, and the seed, along with 1.9 million performance metrics of loss and downstream tasks. The models differed in their architectures, weights, and so on. Using these models, the researchers fit over 1,000 scaling laws and compared their accuracy across architectures, model sizes, and training regimes, as well as testing how the number of models, inclusion of intermediate training checkpoints, and partial training impacted the predictive power of scaling laws to target models. They used measurements of absolute relative error (ARE); this is the difference between the scaling law’s prediction and the observed loss of a large, trained model. With this, the team compared the scaling laws, and after analysis, distilled practical recommendations for AI practitioners about what makes effective scaling laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their shared guidelines walk the developer through steps and options to consider and expectations. First, it’s critical to decide on a compute budget and target model accuracy. The team found that 4 percent ARE is about the best achievable accuracy one could expect due to random seed noise, but up to 20 percent ARE is still useful for decision-making. The researchers identified several factors that improve predictions, like including intermediate training checkpoints, rather than relying only on final losses; this made scaling laws more reliable. However, very early training data before 10 billion tokens are noisy, reduce accuracy, and should be discarded. They recommend prioritizing training more models across a spread of sizes to improve robustness of the scaling law’s prediction, not just larger models; selecting five models provides a solid starting point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, including larger models improves prediction, but costs can be saved by partially training the target model to about 30 percent of its dataset and using that for extrapolation. If the budget is considerably constrained, developers should consider training one smaller model within the target model family and borrow scaling law parameters from a model family with similar architecture; however, this may not work for encoder–decoder models. Lastly, the MIT-IBM research group found that when scaling laws were compared across model families, there was strong correlation between two sets of hyperparameters, meaning that three of the five hyperparameters explained nearly all of the variation and could likely capture the model behavior. Together, these guidelines provide a systematic approach to making scaling law estimation more efficient, reliable, and accessible for AI researchers working under varying budget constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several surprises arose during this work: small models partially trained are still very predictive, and further, the intermediate training stages from a fully trained model can be used (as if they are individual models) for prediction of another target model. “Basically, you don’t pay anything in the training, because you already trained the full model, so the half-trained model, for instance, is just a byproduct of what you did,” says Choshen. Another feature Andreas pointed out was that, when aggregated, the variability across model families and different experiments jumped out and was noisier than expected. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that it’s possible to utilize the scaling laws on large models to predict performance down to smaller models. Other research in the field has hypothesized that smaller models were a “different beast” compared to large ones; however, Choshen disagrees. “If they’re totally different, they should have shown totally different behavior, and they don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this work focused on model training time, the researchers plan to extend their analysis to model inference. Andreas says it’s not, “how does my model get better as I add more training data or more parameters, but instead as I let it think for longer, draw more samples. I think there are definitely lessons to be learned here about how to also build predictive models of how much thinking you need to do at run time.” He says the theory of inference time scaling laws might become even more critical because, “it’s not like I'm going to train one model and then be done. [Rather,] it’s every time a user comes to me, they’re going to have a new query, and I need to figure out how hard [my model needs] to think to come up with the best answer. So, being able to build those kinds of predictive models, like we’re doing in this paper, is even more important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and a Sloan Research Fellowship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/Increasing-LLM-size.jpg?itok=I-0gEXtr\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Scaling laws enable researchers to use smaller LLMs to predict the performance of a significantly bigger target model, thus allowing better allocation of computational power.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: AdobeStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab\">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Machine-learning tool gives doctors a more detailed 3D picture of fetal health</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-tool-gives-doctors-more-detailed-3d-picture-fetal-health-0915</link>\n  <description>MIT CSAIL researchers developed a tool that can model the shape and movements of fetuses in 3D, potentially assisting doctors in finding abnormalities and making diagnoses.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-tool-gives-doctors-more-detailed-3d-picture-fetal-health-0915</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Alex Shipps | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-9f9513be-7fff-adbc-e573-265de5f3d249\"&gt;For pregnant women, ultrasounds are an informative (and sometimes necessary) procedure. They typically produce two-dimensional black-and-white scans of fetuses that can reveal key insights, including biological sex, approximate size, and abnormalities like heart issues or cleft lip. If your doctor wants a closer look, they may use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields to capture images that can be combined to create a 3D view of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MRIs aren’t a catch-all, though; the 3D scans are difficult for doctors to interpret well enough to diagnose problems because our visual system is not accustomed to processing 3D volumetric scans (in other words, a wrap-around look that also shows us the inner structures of a subject). Enter machine learning, which could help model a fetus’s development more clearly and accurately from data — although no such algorithm has been able to model their somewhat random movements and various body shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;That is, until a new approach called “Fetal SMPL” from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), and Harvard Medical School presented clinicians with a more detailed picture of fetal health. It was adapted from “SMPL” (Skinned Multi-Person Linear model), a 3D model developed in computer graphics to capture adult body shapes and poses, as a way to represent fetal body shapes and poses accurately. Fetal SMPL was then trained on 20,000 MRI volumes to predict the location and size of a fetus and create sculpture-like 3D representations. Inside each model is a skeleton with 23 articulated joints called a “kinematic tree,” which the system uses to pose and move like the fetuses it saw during training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The extensive, real-world scans that Fetal SMPL learned from helped it develop pinpoint accuracy. Imagine stepping into a stranger’s footprint while blindfolded, and not only does it fit perfectly, but you correctly guess what shoe they wore — similarly, the tool closely matched the position and size of fetuses in MRI frames it hadn’t seen before. Fetal SMPL was only misaligned by an average of about 3.1 millimeters, a gap smaller than a single grain of rice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approach could enable doctors to precisely measure things like the size of a baby’s head or abdomen and compare these metrics with healthy fetuses at the same age. Fetal SMPL has demonstrated its clinical potential in early tests, where it achieved accurate alignment results on a small group of real-world scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“It can be challenging to estimate the shape and pose of a fetus because they’re crammed into the tight confines of the uterus,” says lead author, MIT PhD student, and CSAIL researcher Yingcheng Liu SM ’21. “Our approach overcomes this challenge using a system of interconnected bones under the surface of the 3D model, which represent the fetal body and its motions realistically. Then, it relies on a coordinate descent algorithm to make a prediction, essentially alternating between guessing pose and shape from tricky data until it finds a reliable estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In utero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fetal SMPL was tested on shape and pose accuracy against the closest baseline the researchers could find: a system that models infant growth called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://files.is.tue.mpg.de/black/papers/miccai18.pdf\"&gt;“SMIL.”&lt;/a&gt; Since babies out of the womb are larger than fetuses, the team shrank those models by 75 percent to level the playing field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system outperformed this baseline on a dataset of fetal MRIs between the gestational ages of 24 and 37 weeks taken at Boston Children’s Hospital. Fetal SMPL was able to recreate real scans more precisely, as its models closely lined up with real MRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The method was efficient at lining up their models to images, only needing three iterations to arrive at a reasonable alignment. In an experiment that counted how many incorrect guesses Fetal SMPL had made before arriving at a final estimate, its accuracy plateaued from the fourth step onward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers have just begun testing their system in the real world, where it produced similarly accurate models in initial clinical tests. While these results are promising, the team notes that they’ll need to apply their results to larger populations, different gestational ages, and a variety of disease cases to better understand the system’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only skin deep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Liu also notes that their system only helps analyze what doctors can see on the surface of a fetus, since only bone-like structures lie beneath the skin of the models. To better monitor babies’ internal health, such as liver, lung, and muscle development, the team intends to make their tool volumetric, modeling the fetus’s inner anatomy from scans. Such upgrades would make the models more human-like, but the current version of Fetal SMPL already presents a precise (and unique) upgrade to 3D fetal health analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This study introduces a method specifically designed for fetal MRI that effectively captures fetal movements, enhancing the assessment of fetal development and health,” says Kiho Im, Harvard Medical School associate professor of pediatrics and staff scientist in the Division of Newborn Medicine at BCH’s Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center. Im, who was not involved with the paper, adds that this approach “will not only improve the diagnostic utility of fetal MRI, but also provide insights into the early functional development of the fetal brain in relation to body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This work reaches a pioneering milestone by extending parametric surface human body models for the earliest shapes of human life: fetuses,” says Sergi Pujades, an associate professor at University Grenoble Alpes, who wasn’t involved in the research. “It allows us to detangle the shape and motion of a human, which has already proven to be key in understanding how adult body shape relates to metabolic conditions and how infant motion relates to neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, the fact that the fetal model stems from, and is compatible with, the adult (SMPL) and infant (SMIL) body models, will allow us to study human shape and pose evolution over long periods of time. This is an unprecedented opportunity to further quantify how human shape growth and motion are affected by different conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu wrote the paper with three CSAIL members: Peiqi Wang SM ’22, PhD ’25; MIT PhD student Sebastian Diaz; and senior author Polina Golland, the Sunlin and Priscilla Chou Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a principal investigator in MIT CSAIL, and the leader of the Medical Vision Group. BCH assistant professor of pediatrics Esra Abaci Turk, Inria researcher Benjamin Billot, and Harvard Medical School professor of pediatrics and professor of radiology Patricia Ellen Grant are also authors on the paper.

The center will be part of the fourth phase of NNSA's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://psaap.llnl.gov/\"&gt;Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program&lt;/a&gt; (PSAAP-IV), which supports frontier research advancing the predictive capabilities of high-performance computing for open science and engineering applications relevant to national security mission spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://chefsi.mit.edu/\"&gt;Center for the Exascale Simulation of Coupled High-Enthalpy Fluid–Solid Interactions&lt;/a&gt; (CHEFSI) — a joint effort of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cse.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Center for Computational Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://computing.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://isn.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies&lt;/a&gt; (ISN) —&amp;nbsp;plans to harness &lt;a name=\"_Int_hvY0bt2J\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cutting-edge exascale supercomputers and next-generation algorithms to simulate with unprecedented detail how extremely hot, fast-moving gaseous and solid materials interact. The understanding of these extreme environments — characterized by temperatures of more than 1,500 degrees Celsius and speeds as high as Mach&amp;nbsp;25 — and their effect on vehicles is central to national security, space exploration, and the development of advanced thermal protection systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CHEFSI will capitalize on MIT’s deep strengths in predictive modeling, high-performance computing, and STEM education to help ensure the United States remains at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation,” says Ian A. Waitz, MIT’s vice president for research. “The center’s particular relevance to national security and advanced technologies exemplifies MIT’s commitment to advancing research with broad societal benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI is one of five new Predictive Simulation Centers announced by the NNSA as part of a program expected to provide up to $17.5 million to each center over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI’s research aims to couple detailed simulations of high-enthalpy gas flows with models of the chemical, thermal, and mechanical behavior of solid materials, capturing phenomena such as oxidation, nitridation, ablation, and fracture. Advanced computational models — validated by carefully designed experiments — can address the limitations of flight testing by providing critical insights into material performance and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating high-fidelity physics models with artificial intelligence-based surrogate models, experimental validation, and state-of-the-art exascale computational tools, CHEFSI will help us understand and predict how thermal protection systems perform under some of the harshest conditions encountered in engineering systems,” says Raúl Radovitzky, the Jerome C. Hunsaker Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, associate director of the ISN, and director of CHEFSI. “This knowledge will help in the design of resilient systems for applications ranging from reusable spacecraft to hypersonic vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radovitzky will be joined on the center’s leadership team by Youssef Marzouk, the Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, co-director of the MIT Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE), and recently named the associate dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing; and Nicolas Hadjiconstantinou, the Quentin Berg (1937) Professor of Mechanical Engineering and co-director of CCSE, who will serve as associate directors. The center&amp;nbsp;co-principal investigators include MIT faculty members across the departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Materials Science and Engineering, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering. Franklin Hadley will lead center operations, with administration and finance under the&amp;nbsp;purview of Joshua Freedman. Hadley and Freedman are both members of the ISN headquarters team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI expects to collaborate extensively with the DoE/NNSA national laboratories —&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories — and, in doing so, offer graduate students and postdocs immersive research experiences and internships at these facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/orion-reentry-00.jpg?itok=GkvaXXWN\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers in the new MIT Center for the Exascale Simulation of Coupled High-Enthalpy Fluid–Solid Interactions will study environments and material interactions such as those involved in the reentry of spacecraft into Earth's atmosphere.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Illustration: NASA</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/supercomputing\">Supercomputing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/space\">Space</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/security-studies\">Security studies and military</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dmse\">DMSE</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/doe\">Department of Energy (DoE)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>AI and machine learning for engineering design</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-machine-learning-for-engineering-design-0907</link>\n  <description>Popular mechanical engineering course applies machine learning and AI theory to real-world engineering design.</description>\n  <pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-machine-learning-for-engineering-design-0907</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Wilson | Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence optimization offers a host of benefits for mechanical engineers, including faster and more accurate designs and simulations, improved efficiency, reduced development costs through process automation, and enhanced predictive maintenance and quality control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people think about mechanical&amp;nbsp;engineering, they're thinking about basic mechanical tools like&amp;nbsp;hammers and … hardware like cars, robots, cranes, but mechanical engineering is very broad,” says Faez Ahmed, the Doherty Chair in Ocean Utilization and associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “Within mechanical engineering,&amp;nbsp;machine learning, AI, and optimization are playing a big role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ahmed’s course, &lt;a href=\"https://meche.mit.edu/featured-classes/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-engineering-design\"&gt;2.155/156&lt;/a&gt; (AI and Machine Learning for Engineering Design), students use tools and techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning for mechanical engineering design, focusing on the creation of new products and addressing engineering design challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of reason for mechanical engineers to think about machine learning and AI to essentially expedite the design process,” says Lyle Regenwetter, a teaching assistant for the course and a PhD candidate in Ahmed’s Design Computation and Digital Engineering Lab (DeCoDE), where research focuses on developing new machine learning and optimization methods to study complex engineering design problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First offered in 2021, the class has quickly become one of the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE)’s most popular non-core offerings, attracting students from departments across the Institute, including mechanical and civil and environmental engineering, aeronautics and astronautics, the MIT Sloan School of Management, and nuclear and computer science, along with cross-registered students from Harvard University and other schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course, which is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, focuses on the implementation of advanced machine learning and optimization strategies in the context of real-world mechanical design problems.&amp;nbsp;From designing&amp;nbsp;bike frames to city grids, students participate in contests related to AI for physical systems and&amp;nbsp;tackle optimization challenges in a class environment fueled by friendly competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students are given challenge problems and starter code that “gave a solution, but [not] the best solution …” explains Ilan Moyer, a graduate student in MechE. “Our task was to [determine],&amp;nbsp;how can we do better?” Live leaderboards encourage students to continually refine their methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Em Lauber, a system design and management graduate student, says the process gave space to explore the application of what students were learning and the practice skill of “literally how to code it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curriculum incorporates discussions on research papers, and students also pursue hands-on exercises in machine learning tailored to specific engineering issues including robotics, aircraft, structures, and metamaterials. For their final project, students work together on a team project that employs AI techniques for design on a complex problem of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is wonderful to see the diverse breadth and high quality of class projects,” says Ahmed. “Student projects from this course often lead to research publications, and have even led to awards.” He cites the example of a recent paper, titled “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23287\"&gt;GenCAD-Self-Repairing&lt;/a&gt;,” that went on to win the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Systems Engineering, Information and Knowledge Management 2025 Best Paper Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best part about the final project was that it gave every student the opportunity to apply what they’ve learned in the class to an area that interests them a lot,” says Malia Smith, a graduate student in MechE. Her project chose “markered motion captured data” and looked at predicting ground force for runners, an effort she called “really gratifying” because it worked so much better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauber took the framework of a “cat tree” design with different modules of poles, platforms, and ramps to create customized solutions for individual cat households, while Moyer created software that is designing a new type of 3D printer architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you see machine learning in popular culture, it’s very abstracted, and you have the sense that there’s something very complicated going on,” says Moyer. “This class has opened the curtains.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-AI-Design-B_0.jpg?itok=MPVjWyPQ\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT mechanical engineering graduate student Malia Smith (left) asks teaching assistant Noah Bagazinski for feedback on her final project for course 2.155/156 (AI and Machine Learning for Engineering Design).</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Lauren Futami</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/students\">Students</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/design\">Design</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/civil-engineering\">Civil and environmental engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A greener way to 3D print stronger stuff</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/greener-way-3d-print-stronger-stuff-0904</link>\n  <description>MIT CSAIL researchers developed SustainaPrint, a system that reinforces only the weakest zones of eco-friendly 3D prints, achieving strong results with less plastic.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/greener-way-3d-print-stronger-stuff-0904</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-8a16a100-7fff-866e-17d3-0c98f0ab7768\"&gt;3D printing has come a long way since its invention in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who pioneered stereolithography, a technique that solidifies liquid resin into solid objects using ultraviolet lasers. Over the decades, 3D printers have evolved from experimental curiosities into tools capable of producing everything from custom prosthetics to complex food designs, architectural models, and even functioning human organs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;But as the technology matures, its environmental footprint has become increasingly difficult to set aside. The vast majority of consumer and industrial 3D printing still relies on petroleum-based plastic filament. And while “greener” alternatives made from biodegradable or recycled materials exist, they come with a serious trade-off: they’re often not as strong. These eco-friendly filaments tend to become brittle under stress, making them ill-suited for structural applications or load-bearing parts — exactly where strength matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;This trade-off between sustainability and mechanical performance prompted researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Hasso Plattner Institute to ask: Is it possible to build objects that are mostly eco-friendly, but still strong where it counts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Their answer is &lt;a href=\"https://maxineaps.github.io/sustainaprint-project-site/\"&gt;SustainaPrint&lt;/a&gt;, a new software and hardware toolkit designed to help users strategically combine strong and weak filaments to get the best of both worlds. Instead of printing an entire object with high-performance plastic, the system analyzes a model through finite element analysis simulations, predicts where the object is most likely to experience stress, and then reinforces just those zones with stronger material. The rest of the part can be printed using greener, weaker filament, reducing plastic use while preserving structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Our hope is that SustainaPrint can be used in industrial and distributed manufacturing settings one day, where local material stocks may vary in quality and composition,” says MIT PhD student and CSAIL researcher Maxine Perroni-Scharf, who is a lead author on a &lt;a href=\"https://maxineaps.github.io/sustainaprint-project-site/\"&gt;paper presenting the project&lt;/a&gt;. “In these contexts, the testing toolkit could help ensure the reliability of available filaments, while the software’s reinforcement strategy could reduce overall material consumption without sacrificing function.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For their experiments, the team used Polymaker’s PolyTerra PLA as the eco-friendly filament, and standard or Tough PLA from Ultimaker for reinforcement. They used a 20 percent reinforcement threshold to show that even a small amount of strong plastic goes a long way. Using this ratio, SustainaPrint was able to recover up to 70 percent of the strength of an object printed entirely with high-performance plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;They printed dozens of objects, from simple mechanical shapes like rings and beams to more functional household items such as headphone stands, wall hooks, and plant pots. Each object was printed three ways: once using only eco-friendly filament, once using only strong PLA, and once with the hybrid SustainaPrint configuration. The printed parts were then mechanically tested by pulling, bending, or otherwise breaking them to measure how much force each configuration could withstand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In many cases, the hybrid prints held up nearly as well as the full-strength versions. For example, in one test involving a dome-like shape, the hybrid version outperformed the version printed entirely in Tough PLA. The team believes this may be due to the reinforced version’s ability to distribute stress more evenly, avoiding the brittle failure sometimes caused by excessive stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This indicates that in certain geometries and loading conditions, mixing materials strategically may actually outperform a single homogenous material,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It’s a reminder that real-world mechanical behavior is full of complexity, especially in 3D printing, where interlayer adhesion and tool path decisions can affect performance in unexpected ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lean, green, eco-friendly printing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;SustainaPrint starts off by letting a user upload their 3D model into a custom interface. By selecting fixed regions and areas where forces will be applied, the software then uses an approach called “Finite Element Analysis” to simulate how the object will deform under stress. It then creates a map showing pressure distribution inside the structure, highlighting areas under compression or tension, and applies heuristics to segment the object into two categories: those that need reinforcement, and those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Recognizing the need for accessible and low-cost testing, the team also developed a DIY testing toolkit to help users assess strength before printing. The kit has a 3D-printable device with modules for measuring both tensile and flexural strength. Users can pair the device with common items like pull-up bars or digital scales to get rough, but reliable performance metrics. The team benchmarked their results against manufacturer data and found that their measurements consistently fell within one standard deviation, even for filaments that had undergone multiple recycling cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Although the current system is designed for dual-extrusion printers, the researchers believe that with some manual filament swapping and calibration, it could be adapted for single-extruder setups, too. In current form, the system simplifies the modeling process by allowing just one force and one fixed boundary per simulation. While this covers a wide range of common use cases, the team sees future work expanding the software to support more complex and dynamic loading conditions. The team also sees potential in using AI to infer the object’s intended use based on its geometry, which could allow for fully automated stress modeling without manual input of forces or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D for free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers plan to release SustainaPrint open-source, making both the software and testing toolkit available for public use and modification. Another initiative they aspire to bring to life in the future: education. “In a classroom, SustainaPrint isn’t just a tool, it’s a way to teach students about material science, structural engineering, and sustainable design, all in one project,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It turns these abstract concepts into something tangible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;As 3D printing becomes more embedded in how we manufacture and prototype everything from consumer goods to emergency equipment, sustainability concerns will only grow. With tools like SustainaPrint, those concerns no longer need to come at the expense of performance. Instead, they can become part of the design process: built into the very geometry of the things we make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Co-author Patrick Baudisch, who is a professor at the Hasso Plattner Institute, adds that “the project addresses a key question: What is the point of collecting material for the purpose of recycling, when there is no plan to actually ever use that material? Maxine presents the missing link between the theoretical/abstract idea of 3D printing material recycling and what it actually takes to make this idea relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Perroni-Scharf and Baudisch wrote the paper with CSAIL research assistant Jennifer Xiao; MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science master’s student Cole Paulin ’24; master’s student Ray Wang SM ’25 and PhD student Ticha Sethapakdi SM ’19 (both CSAIL members); Hasso Plattner Institute PhD student Muhammad Abdullah; and Associate Professor Stefanie Mueller, lead of the Human-Computer Interaction Engineering Group at CSAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers’ work was supported by a Designing for Sustainability Grant from the Designing for Sustainability MIT-HPI Research Program.

These have had limited success, in part because until now they have not been grounded in an understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the laws of conservation of mass. Now, a team of researchers at MIT has come up with a way of incorporating these physical constraints on a reaction prediction model, and thus greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work was &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09426-9\"&gt;reported Aug. 20 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by recent postdoc Joonyoung Joung (now an assistant professor at Kookmin University, South Korea); former software engineer Mun Hong Fong (now at Duke University); chemical engineering graduate student Nicholas Casetti; postdoc Jordan Liles; physics undergraduate student Ne Dassanayake; and senior author Connor Coley, who is the Class of 1957 Career Development Professor in the MIT departments of Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prediction of reaction outcomes is a very important task,” Joung explains. For example, if you want to make a new drug, “you need to know how to make it. So, this requires us to know what product is likely” to result from a given set of chemical inputs to a reaction. But most previous efforts to carry out such predictions look only at a set of inputs and a set of outputs, without looking at the intermediate steps or considering the constraints of ensuring that no mass is gained or lost in the process, which is not possible in actual reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joung points out that while large language models such as ChatGPT have been very successful in many areas of research, these models do not provide a way to limit their outputs to physically realistic possibilities, such as by requiring them to adhere to conservation of mass. These models use computational “tokens,” which in this case represent individual atoms, but “if you don’t conserve the tokens, the LLM model starts to make new atoms, or deletes atoms in the reaction.” Instead of being grounded in real scientific understanding, “this is kind of like alchemy,” he says. While many attempts at reaction prediction only look at the final products, “we want to track all the chemicals, and how the chemicals are transformed” throughout the reaction process from start to end, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to address the problem, the team made use of a method developed back in the 1970s by chemist Ivar Ugi, which uses a bond-electron matrix to represent the electrons in a reaction. They used this system as the basis for their new program, called FlowER (Flow matching for Electron Redistribution), which allows them to explicitly keep track of all the electrons in the reaction to ensure that none are spuriously added or deleted in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses a matrix to represent the electrons in a reaction, and uses nonzero values to represent bonds or lone electron pairs and zeros to represent a lack thereof. “That helps us to conserve both atoms and electrons at the same time,” says Fong. This representation, he says, was one of the key elements to including mass conservation in their prediction system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system they developed is still at an early stage, Coley says. “The system as it stands is a demonstration — a proof of concept that this generative approach of flow matching is very well suited to the task of chemical reaction prediction.” While the team is excited about this promising approach, he says, “we’re aware that it does have specific limitations as far as the breadth of different chemistries that it’s seen.” Although the model was trained using data on more than a million chemical reactions, obtained from a U.S. Patent Office database, those data do not include certain metals and some kinds of catalytic reactions, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re incredibly excited about the fact that we can get such reliable predictions of chemical mechanisms” from the existing system, he says. “It conserves mass, it conserves electrons, but we certainly acknowledge that there’s a lot more expansion and robustness to work on in the coming years as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even in its present form, which is being made freely available through the online platform GitHub, “we think it will make accurate predictions and be helpful as a tool for assessing reactivity and mapping out reaction pathways,” Coley says. “If we’re looking toward the future of really advancing the state of the art of mechanistic understanding and helping to invent new reactions, we’re not quite there. But we hope this will be a steppingstone toward that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all open source,” says Fong. “The models, the data, all of them are up there,” including a previous dataset developed by Joung that exhaustively lists the mechanistic steps of known reactions. “I think we are one of the pioneering groups making this dataset, and making it available open-source, and making this usable for everyone,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlowER model matches or outperforms existing approaches in finding standard mechanistic pathways, the team says, and makes it possible to generalize to previously unseen reaction types. They say the model could potentially be relevant for predicting reactions for medicinal chemistry, materials discovery, combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and electrochemical systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their comparisons with existing reaction prediction systems, Coley says, “using the architecture choices that we’ve made, we get this massive increase in validity and conservation, and we get a matching or a little bit better accuracy in terms of performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that “what’s unique about our approach is that while we are using these textbook understandings of mechanisms to generate this dataset, we’re anchoring the reactants and products of the overall reaction in experimentally validated data from the patent literature.”&amp;nbsp;They are inferring the underlying mechanisms, he says, rather than just making them up. “We’re imputing them from experimental data, and that’s not something that has been done and shared at this kind of scale before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step, he says, is “we are quite interested in expanding the model’s understanding of metals and catalytic cycles. We’ve just scratched the surface in this first paper,” and most of the reactions included so far don’t include metals or catalysts, “so that’s a direction we’re quite interested in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, he says, “a lot of the excitement is in using this kind of system to help discover new complex reactions and help elucidate new mechanisms. I think that the long-term potential impact is big, but this is of course just a first step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis consortium and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-flower.jpg?itok=xtPoC4hU\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The FlowER (Flow matching for Electron Redistribution) system allows a researcher to explicitly keep track of all the electrons in a reaction to ensure that none are spuriously added or deleted in the process of predicting the outcome of a chemical reaction.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image courtesy of the researchers.</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-source\">Open source</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nsf\">National Science Foundation (NSF)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>3 Questions: The pros and cons of synthetic data in AI </title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-pros-cons-synthetic-data-ai-kalyan-veeramachaneni-0903</link>\n  <description>Artificially created data offer benefits from cost savings to privacy preservation, but their limitations require careful planning and evaluation, Kalyan Veeramachaneni says.  </description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-pros-cons-synthetic-data-ai-kalyan-veeramachaneni-0903</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthetic data are artificially generated by algorithms to mimic the statistical properties of actual data, without containing any information from real-world sources. While concrete numbers are hard to pin down, some estimates suggest that more than 60 percent of data used for AI applications in 2024 was synthetic, and this figure is expected to grow across industries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because synthetic data don’t contain real-world information, they hold the promise of safeguarding privacy while reducing the cost and increasing the speed at which new AI models are developed. But&amp;nbsp;using synthetic data requires careful&amp;nbsp;evaluation, planning, and checks and balances to prevent loss of performance when AI models are deployed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To unpack some pros and cons of using synthetic data,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a principal research scientist in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems&amp;nbsp;and co-founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://datacebo.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DataCebo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;whose open-core platform,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Synthetic Data Vault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;users generate and test synthetic data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;How are synthetic data created?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Synthetic data are algorithmically generated but do not come from a real situation. Their value lies in their statistical similarity to real data. If we’re talking about language, for instance, synthetic data look very much as if a human had written those sentences. While researchers have created synthetic data for a long time, what has changed in the past few years is our ability to build generative models out of data and use them to create realistic synthetic data. We can take a little bit of real data and build a generative model from that, which we can use to create as much synthetic data as we want. Plus, the model creates synthetic data in a way that captures all the underlying rules and infinite patterns that exist in the real data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are essentially&amp;nbsp;four&amp;nbsp;different data modalities: language, video or images,&amp;nbsp;audio,&amp;nbsp;and tabular data. All four&amp;nbsp;of them have slightly different ways of building the generative models to create synthetic data. An LLM, for instance, is nothing but a generative model from which you are sampling synthetic data when you ask it a question.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of language and image data are publicly available on the internet. But tabular data, which is the data collected when we interact with physical and social systems, is often locked up behind enterprise firewalls. Much of it is sensitive or private, such as customer transactions stored by a bank. For this type of data, platforms like the Synthetic Data Vault provide software that can be used to build generative models. Those models then create synthetic data that preserve customer privacy and can be shared more widely.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One powerful thing about this generative modeling approach for synthesizing data is that enterprises can now build a customized, local model for their own data. Generative AI automates what used to be a manual process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What are some benefits of using synthetic data, and which use-cases and applications are they particularly well-suited for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One fundamental application which has grown tremendously over the past decade is using synthetic data to test software applications. There is data-driven logic behind many software applications, so you need data to test that software and its functionality. In the past, people have resorted to manually generating data, but now we can use generative models to create as much data as we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also create specific data for application testing. Say I work for an e-commerce company. I can generate synthetic data that mimics real customers who live in Ohio and made transactions pertaining to one particular product in February or March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because synthetic data aren’t drawn from real situations, they are also privacy-preserving. One of the biggest problems in software testing has been getting access to sensitive real data for testing software in non-production environments, due to privacy concerns.&amp;nbsp;Another immediate benefit is in performance testing. You can create a billion transactions from a generative model and test how fast your system can process them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another application where synthetic data hold a lot of promise is in training machine-learning models. Sometimes, we want an AI model to help us predict an event that is less frequent. A bank may want to use an AI model to predict fraudulent transactions, but there may be too few real examples to train a model that can identify fraud accurately.&amp;nbsp;Synthetic data provide data augmentation — additional data examples that are similar to the real data. These can significantly improve the accuracy of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes users don’t have time or the financial resources to collect all the data. For instance, collecting data about customer intent would require conducting many surveys. If you end up with limited data and then try to train a model, it won’t perform well. You can augment by adding synthetic data to train those models better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What are some of the risks or potential pitfalls of using synthetic data, and are there steps users can take to prevent or mitigate those problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the biggest questions people often have in their mind is, if the data are synthetically created, why should I trust them? Determining whether you can trust the data often comes down to evaluating the overall system where you are using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of aspects of synthetic data we have been able to evaluate for a long time. For instance, there are existing methods to measure how close synthetic data are to real data, and we can measure their quality and whether they preserve privacy. But there are other important considerations if you are using those synthetic data to train a machine-learning model for a new use case. How would you know the data are going to lead to models that still make valid conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New efficacy metrics are emerging, and the emphasis is now on efficacy for a particular task. You must really dig into your workflow to ensure the synthetic data you add to the system still allow you to draw valid conclusions. That is something that must be done carefully on an application-by-application basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bias can also be an issue. Since it is created from a small amount of real data, the same bias that exists in the real data can carry over into the synthetic data. Just like with real data, you would need to purposefully make sure the bias is removed through different sampling techniques, which can create balanced datasets. It takes some careful planning, but you can calibrate the data generation to prevent the proliferation of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with the evaluation process, our group created the &lt;a href=\"https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Synthetic Data Metrics Library&lt;/a&gt;. We worried that people would use synthetic data in their environment and it would give different conclusions in the real world. We created a metrics and evaluation library to&amp;nbsp;ensure&amp;nbsp;checks and balances. The machine learning community has faced a lot of challenges in ensuring models can generalize to new situations. The use of synthetic data adds a whole new dimension to that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect that the old systems of working with data, whether to build software applications, answer analytical questions, or train models, will dramatically change as we get more sophisticated at building these generative models. A lot of things we have never been able to do before will now be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-3Q-Synthetic-01-press.jpg?itok=kGcQGLUI\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Kalyan Veeramachaneni spoke with MIT News about the pros and cons of using synthetic data.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/interview\">Interview</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>3 Questions: On biology and medicine’s “data revolution”</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-caroline-uhler-biology-medicine-data-revolution-0902</link>\n  <description>Professor Caroline Uhler discusses her work at the Schmidt Center, thorny problems in math, and the ongoing quest to understand some of the most complex interactions in biology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:45:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-caroline-uhler-biology-medicine-data-revolution-0902</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jane Halpern | Elvira Forte | Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caroline Uhler is&amp;nbsp;an Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Engineering at MIT; a professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the Institute for Data, Science, and Society (IDSS);&amp;nbsp;and director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she is also a core institute and scientific leadership team member.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uhler is interested in all the methods by which scientists can uncover causality in biological systems, ranging from causal discovery on observed variables to causal feature learning and representation learning.&amp;nbsp;In this interview, she discusses machine learning in biology, areas that are ripe for problem-solving, and cutting-edge research coming out of the Schmidt Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center has four distinct areas of focus structured around four natural levels of biological organization: proteins, cells, tissues, and organisms. What, within the current landscape of machine learning, makes&amp;nbsp;now the right time to work on these specific problem classes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Biology and medicine are currently undergoing a “data revolution.” The availability of large-scale, diverse datasets — ranging from genomics and multi-omics to high-resolution imaging and electronic health records — makes this an opportune time. Inexpensive and accurate DNA sequencing is a reality, advanced molecular imaging has become routine, and single cell genomics is allowing the profiling of millions of cells. These innovations — and the massive datasets they produce — have brought us to the threshold of a new era in biology, one where we will be able to move beyond characterizing the units of life (such as all proteins, genes, and cell types) to understanding the `programs of life’, such as the logic of gene circuits and cell-cell communication that underlies tissue patterning and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the genotype-phenotype map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;At the same time, in the past decade, machine learning has seen remarkable progress with models like BERT, GPT-3, and ChatGPT demonstrating advanced capabilities in text understanding and generation, while vision transformers and multimodal models like CLIP have achieved human-level performance in image-related tasks. These breakthroughs provide powerful architectural blueprints and training strategies that can be adapted to biological data. For instance, transformers can model genomic sequences similar to language, and vision models can analyze medical and microscopy images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Importantly, biology is poised to be not just a beneficiary of machine learning, but also a significant source of inspiration for new ML research. Much like agriculture and breeding spurred modern statistics, biology has the potential to inspire new and perhaps even more profound avenues of ML research. Unlike fields such as recommender systems and internet advertising, where there are no natural laws to discover and predictive accuracy is the ultimate measure of value, in biology, phenomena are physically interpretable, and causal mechanisms are the ultimate goal. Additionally, biology boasts genetic and chemical tools that enable perturbational screens on an unparalleled scale compared to other fields. These combined features make biology uniquely suited to both benefit greatly from ML and serve as a profound wellspring of inspiration for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Taking a somewhat different tack, what problems in biology are still really resistant to our current tool set? Are there areas, perhaps specific challenges in disease or in wellness, which you feel are ripe for problem-solving?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable success in predictive tasks across domains such as image classification, natural language processing, and clinical risk modeling. However, in the biological sciences, predictive accuracy is often insufficient. The fundamental questions in these fields are inherently causal: How does a perturbation to a specific gene or pathway affect downstream cellular processes? What is the mechanism by which an intervention leads to a phenotypic change? Traditional machine learning models, which are primarily optimized for capturing statistical associations in observational data, often fail to answer such interventional queries.There is a strong need for biology and medicine to also inspire new foundational developments in machine learning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field is now equipped with high-throughput perturbation technologies — such as pooled CRISPR screens, single-cell transcriptomics, and spatial profiling — that generate rich datasets under systematic interventions. These data modalities naturally call for the development of models that go beyond pattern recognition to support causal inference, active experimental design, and representation learning in settings with complex, structured latent variables. From a mathematical perspective, this requires tackling core questions of identifiability, sample efficiency, and the integration of combinatorial, geometric, and probabilistic tools. I believe that addressing these challenges will not only unlock new insights into the mechanisms of cellular systems, but also push the theoretical boundaries of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to foundation models, a consensus in the field is that we are still far from creating a holistic foundation model for biology across scales, similar to what ChatGPT represents in the language domain — a sort of digital organism capable of simulating all biological phenomena. While new foundation models emerge almost weekly, these models have thus far been specialized for a specific scale and question, and focus on one or a few modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant progress has been made in predicting protein structures from their sequences. This success has highlighted the importance of iterative machine learning challenges, such as CASP (critical assessment of structure prediction), which have been instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms for protein structure prediction and driving their improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schmidt Center is organizing challenges to increase awareness in the ML field and make progress in the development of methods to solve causal prediction problems that are so critical for the biomedical sciences. With the increasing availability of single-gene perturbation data at the single-cell level,&amp;nbsp;I believe predicting the effect of single or combinatorial perturbations, and which perturbations could drive a desired phenotype, are solvable problems. With our Cell Perturbation Prediction Challenge (CPPC), we aim to provide the means to objectively test and benchmark algorithms for predicting the effect of new perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the field has made remarkable strides is disease diagnostic and patient triage. Machine learning algorithms can integrate different sources of patient information (data modalities), generate missing modalities, identify patterns that may be difficult for us to detect, and help stratify patients based on their disease risk. While we must remain cautious about potential biases in model predictions, the danger of models learning shortcuts instead of true correlations, and the risk of automation bias in clinical decision-making, I believe this is an area where machine learning is already having a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s talk about some of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/news\"&gt;headlines coming out of the Schmidt Center&lt;/a&gt; recently. What current research do you think people should be particularly excited about, and why?&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;In collaboration with Dr. Fei Chen at the Broad Institute, we have recently developed a method for the prediction of unseen proteins’ subcellular location, called PUPS. Many existing methods can only make predictions based on the specific protein and cell data on which they were trained. PUPS, however, combines a protein language model with an image in-painting model to utilize both protein sequences and cellular images. We demonstrate that the protein sequence input enables generalization to unseen proteins, and the cellular image input captures single-cell variability, enabling cell-type-specific predictions. The model learns how relevant each amino acid residue is for the predicted sub-cellular localization, and it can predict changes in localization due to mutations in the protein sequences. Since proteins’ function is strictly related to their subcellular localization, our predictions could provide insights into potential mechanisms of disease. In the future, we aim to extend this method to predict the localization of multiple proteins in a cell and possibly understand protein-protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with Professor G.V. Shivashankar, a long-time collaborator at ETH Zürich, we have previously shown how simple images of cells stained with fluorescent DNA-intercalating dyes to label the chromatin can yield a lot of information about the state and fate of a cell in health and disease, when combined with machine learning algorithms. Recently, we have furthered this observation and proved the deep link between chromatin organization and gene regulation by developing Image2Reg, a method that enables the prediction of unseen genetically or chemically perturbed genes from chromatin images. Image2Reg utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn an informative representation of the chromatin images of perturbed cells. It also employs a graph convolutional network to create a gene embedding that captures the regulatory effects of genes based on protein-protein interaction data, integrated with cell-type-specific transcriptomic data. Finally, it learns a map between the resulting physical and biochemical representation of cells, allowing us to predict the perturbed gene modules based on chromatin images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we recently finalized the development of a method for predicting the outcomes of unseen combinatorial gene perturbations and identifying the types of interactions occurring between the perturbed genes. MORPH can guide the design of the most informative perturbations for lab-in-a-loop experiments. Furthermore, the attention-based framework provably enables our method to identify causal relations among the genes, providing insights into the underlying gene regulatory programs. Finally, thanks to its modular structure, we can apply MORPH to perturbation data measured in various modalities, including not only transcriptomics, but also imaging. We are very excited about the potential of this method to enable the efficient exploration of the perturbation space to advance our understanding of cellular programs by bridging causal theory to important applications, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-caroline-uhler.jpg?itok=-Tnd3ZSd\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“The current landscape of machine learning presents a unique opportunity to address problems across different levels of biological organization, from proteins to organisms, due to a data revolution in biology and significant advancements in AI,” says Caroline Uhler. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Jiin Kang</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/interview\">Interview</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health\">Health sciences and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/genomics\">Genomics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cells\">Cells</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/proteins\">Proteins</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dna\">DNA</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/crispr\">CRISPR</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT researchers develop AI tool to improve flu vaccine strain selection</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/vaxseer-ai-tool-to-improve-flu-vaccine-strain-selection-0828</link>\n  <description>VaxSeer uses machine learning to predict virus evolution and antigenicity, aiming to make vaccine selection more accurate and less reliant on guesswork.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:50:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/vaxseer-ai-tool-to-improve-flu-vaccine-strain-selection-0828</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2ef4ad7e-7fff-c28e-41c1-d61ce18592ae\"&gt;Every year, global health experts are faced with a high-stakes decision: Which influenza strains should go into the next seasonal vaccine? The choice must be made months in advance, long before flu season even begins, and it can often feel like a race against the clock. If the selected strains match those that circulate, the vaccine will likely be highly effective. But if the prediction is off, protection can drop significantly, leading to (potentially preventable) illness and strain on health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;This challenge became even more familiar to scientists in the years during the Covid-19 pandemic. Think back to the time (and time and time again), when new variants emerged just as vaccines were being rolled out. Influenza behaves like a similar, rowdy cousin, mutating constantly and unpredictably. That makes it hard to stay ahead, and therefore harder to design vaccines that remain protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To reduce this uncertainty, scientists at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health set out to make vaccine selection more accurate and less reliant on guesswork. They created an AI system called VaxSeer, designed to predict dominant flu strains and identify the most protective vaccine candidates, months ahead of time. The tool uses deep learning models trained on decades of viral sequences and lab test results to simulate how the flu virus might evolve and how the vaccines will respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Traditional evolution models often analyze the effect of single amino acid mutations independently. “VaxSeer adopts a large protein language model to learn the relationship between dominance and the combinatorial effects of mutations,” explains Wenxian Shi, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, researcher at CSAIL, and lead author of a new paper on the work. “Unlike existing protein language models that assume a static distribution of viral variants, we model dynamic dominance shifts, making it better suited for rapidly evolving viruses like influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;An &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03917-y\"&gt;open-access report on the study&lt;/a&gt; was published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;VaxSeer has two core prediction engines: one that estimates how likely each viral strain is to spread (dominance), and another that estimates how effectively a vaccine will neutralize that strain (antigenicity). Together, they produce a predicted coverage score: a forward-looking measure of how well a given vaccine is likely to perform against future viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The scale of the score could be from an infinite negative to 0. The closer the score to 0, the better the antigenic match of vaccine strains to the circulating viruses. (You can imagine it as the negative of some kind of “distance.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In a 10-year retrospective study, the researchers evaluated VaxSeer’s recommendations against those made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for two major flu subtypes: A/H3N2 and A/H1N1. For A/H3N2, VaxSeer’s choices outperformed the WHO’s in nine out of 10 seasons, based on retrospective empirical coverage scores (a surrogate metric of the vaccine effectiveness, calculated from the observed dominance from past seasons and experimental HI test results). The team used this to evaluate vaccine selections, as the effectiveness is only available for vaccines actually given to the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For A/H1N1, it outperformed or matched the WHO in six out of 10 seasons. In one notable case, for the 2016 flu season, VaxSeer identified a strain that wasn’t chosen by the WHO until the following year. The model’s predictions also showed strong correlation with real-world vaccine effectiveness estimates, as reported by the CDC, Canada’s Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network, and Europe’s I-MOVE program. VaxSeer’s predicted coverage scores aligned closely with public health data on flu-related illnesses and medical visits prevented by vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;So how exactly does VaxSeer make sense of all these data? Intuitively, the model first estimates how rapidly a viral strain spreads over time using a protein language model, and then determines its dominance by accounting for competition among different strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Once the model has calculated its insights, they’re plugged into a mathematical framework based on something called ordinary differential equations to simulate viral spread over time. For antigenicity, the system estimates how well a given vaccine strain will perform in a common lab test called the hemagglutination inhibition assay. This measures how effectively antibodies can&amp;nbsp;inhibit the virus from binding to human red blood cells, which is a widely used proxy for antigenic match/antigenicity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outpacing evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“By modeling how viruses evolve and how vaccines interact with them, AI tools like VaxSeer could help health officials make better, faster decisions — and stay one step ahead in the race between infection and immunity,” says Shi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;VaxSeer currently focuses only on the flu virus’s HA (hemagglutinin) protein,the major antigen of influenza. Future versions could incorporate other proteins like NA (neuraminidase), and factors like immune history, manufacturing constraints, or dosage levels. Applying the system to other viruses would also require large, high-quality datasets that track both viral evolution and immune responses — data that aren’t always publicly available. The team, however is currently working on the methods that can predict viral evolution in low-data regimes building on relations between viral families&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Given the speed of viral evolution, current therapeutic development often lags behind.&amp;nbsp;VaxSeer is our attempt to catch up,” says Regina Barzilay, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor for AI and Health at MIT, AI lead of Jameel Clinic, and CSAIL principal investigator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This paper is impressive, but what excites me perhaps even more is the team’s ongoing work on predicting viral evolution in low-data settings,” says Assistant Professor Jon Stokes of the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “The implications go far beyond influenza. Imagine being able to anticipate how antibiotic-resistant bacteria or drug-resistant cancers might evolve, both of which can adapt rapidly. This kind of predictive modeling opens up a powerful new way of thinking about how diseases change, giving us the opportunity to stay one step ahead and design clinical interventions before escape becomes a major problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Shi and Barzilay wrote the paper with MIT CSAIL postdoc Jeremy Wohlwend ’16, MEng ’17, PhD ’25 and recent CSAIL affiliate Menghua Wu ’19, MEng ’20, PhD ’25.

This could lead someone to believe a deep-learning model makes more accurate predictions when that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a more robust way of evaluating these techniques, which shows that, while simple models are more accurate when estimating regional surface temperatures, deep-learning approaches can be the best choice for estimating local rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used these results to enhance a simulation tool known as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bc3.mit.edu/demos/en-roads/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;climate emulator&lt;/a&gt;, which can rapidly simulate the effect of human activities onto a future climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers see their work as a “cautionary tale” about the risk of deploying large AI models for climate science. While deep-learning models have shown incredible success in domains such as natural language, climate science contains a proven set of physical laws and approximations, and the challenge becomes how to incorporate those into AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to develop models that are going to be useful and relevant for the kinds of things that decision-makers need going forward when making climate policy choices. While it might be attractive to use the latest, big-picture machine-learning model on a climate problem, what this study shows is that stepping back and really thinking about the problem fundamentals is important and useful,” says study senior author Noelle Selin, a professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), and director of the Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selin’s co-authors are lead author Björn Lütjens, a former EAPS postdoc who is now a research scientist at IBM Research; senior author Raffaele Ferrari, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Oceanography in EAPS and co-director of the Lorenz Center; and Duncan Watson-Parris, assistant professor at the University of California at San Diego. Selin and Ferrari are also co-principal investigators of the &lt;a href=\"https://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/flagship-projects/bringing-computation-to-the-climate-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge&lt;/a&gt; project, out of which this research emerged. The &lt;a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024MS004619\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; appears today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing emulators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Earth’s climate is so complex, running a state-of-the-art climate model to predict how pollution levels will impact environmental factors like temperature can take weeks on the world’s most powerful supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often create climate emulators, simpler approximations of a state-of-the art climate model, which are faster and more accessible. A policymaker could use a climate emulator to see how alternative assumptions on greenhouse gas emissions would affect future temperatures, helping them develop regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an emulator isn’t very useful if it makes inaccurate predictions about the local impacts of climate change. While deep learning has become increasingly popular for emulation, few studies have explored whether these models perform better than tried-and-true approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers performed such a study. They compared a traditional technique called linear pattern scaling (LPS) with a deep-learning model using a common benchmark dataset for evaluating climate emulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that LPS outperformed deep-learning models on predicting nearly all parameters they tested, including temperature and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Large AI methods are very appealing to scientists, but they rarely solve a completely new problem, so implementing an existing solution first is necessary to find out whether the complex machine-learning approach actually improves upon it,” says Lütjens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some initial results seemed to fly in the face of the researchers’ domain knowledge. The powerful deep-learning model should have been more accurate when making predictions about precipitation, since those data don’t follow a linear pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the high amount of natural variability in climate model runs can cause the deep learning model to perform poorly on unpredictable long-term oscillations, like El Niño/La Niña. This skews the benchmarking scores in favor of LPS, which averages out those oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructing a new evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the researchers constructed a new evaluation with more data that address natural climate variability. With this new evaluation, the deep-learning model performed slightly better than LPS for local precipitation, but LPS was still more accurate for temperature predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to use the modeling tool that is right for the problem, but in order to do that you also have to set up the problem the right way in the first place,” Selin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the researchers incorporated LPS into a climate emulation platform to predict local temperature changes in different emission scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not advocating that LPS should always be the goal. It still has limitations. For instance, LPS doesn’t predict variability or extreme weather events,”&amp;nbsp;Ferrari adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, they hope their results emphasize the need to develop better benchmarking techniques, which could provide a fuller picture of which climate emulation technique is best suited for a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With an improved climate emulation benchmark, we could use more complex machine-learning methods to explore problems that are currently very hard to address, like the impacts of aerosols or estimations of extreme precipitation,” Lütjens says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, more accurate benchmarking techniques will help ensure policymakers are making decisions based on the best available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope others build on their analysis, perhaps by studying additional improvements to climate emulation methods and benchmarks. Such research could explore impact-oriented metrics like drought indicators and wildfire risks, or new variables like regional wind speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by Schmidt Sciences, LLC, and is part of the MIT Climate Grand Challenges team for “Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Climate-Emulators-01-press.jpg?itok=EtBcQ0D-\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Simple climate prediction models can outperform deep-learning approaches when predicting future temperature changes, but deep learning has potential for estimating more complex variables like rainfall, according to an MIT study.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pollution\">Pollution</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/public-health\">Public health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/earth-atmosphere\">Earth and atmospheric sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/eaps\">EAPS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New technologies tackle brain health assessment for the military</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technologies-tackle-brain-health-assessment-for-military-0825</link>\n  <description>Tools build on years of research at Lincoln Laboratory to develop a rapid brain health screening capability and may also be applicable to civilian settings such as sporting events and medical offices.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technologies-tackle-brain-health-assessment-for-military-0825</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne McGovern | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive readiness denotes a person's ability to respond and adapt to the changes around them. This includes functions like keeping balance after tripping, or making the right decision in a challenging situation based on knowledge and past experiences. For military service members, cognitive readiness is crucial for their health and safety, as well as mission success. Injury to the brain is a major contributor to cognitive impairment, and between 2000 and 2024,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Centers-of-Excellence/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Center-of-Excellence/DOD-TBI-Worldwide-Numbers\"&gt;more than 500,000&lt;/a&gt; military service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) — caused by anything from a fall during training to blast exposure on the battlefield. While impairment from factors like sleep deprivation can be treated through rest and recovery, others caused by injury may require more intense and prolonged medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Current cognitive readiness tests administered to service members lack the sensitivity to detect subtle shifts in cognitive performance that may occur in individuals exposed to operational hazards,\" says Christopher Smalt, a researcher in the laboratory's &lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/human-health-and-performance-systems\"&gt;Human Health and Performance Systems Group.&lt;/a&gt; \"Unfortunately, the cumulative effects of these exposures are often not well-documented during military service or after transition to Veterans Affairs, making it challenging to provide effective support.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smalt is part of a team at the laboratory developing a suite of portable diagnostic tests that provide near-real-time screening for brain injury and cognitive health. One of these tools, called READY, is a smartphone or tablet app that helps identify a potential change in cognitive performance in less than 90 seconds. Another tool, called MINDSCAPE — which is being developed in collaboration with Richard Fletcher, a visiting scientist in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/rapid-prototyping\"&gt;Rapid Prototyping Group&lt;/a&gt; who leads the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://mobilehealthlab.com/\"&gt;Mobile Technology Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://autoid.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Auto-ID Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, and his students — uses virtual reality (VR) technology for a more in-depth analysis to pinpoint specific conditions such as TBI, post-traumatic stress disorder, or sleep deprivation. Using these tests, medical personnel on the battlefield can make quick and effective decisions for treatment triage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both READY and MINDSCAPE are a response to a series of Congressional legislation mandates, military program requirements, and mission-driven health needs to improve brain health screening capabilities for service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive readiness biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The READY and MINDSCAPE platforms incorporate more than a decade of laboratory research on finding the right indicators of cognitive readiness to build into rapid testing applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/biographies/thomas-f-quatieri\"&gt;Thomas Quatieri&lt;/a&gt; oversaw this work and identified balance, eye movement, and speech as three reliable biomarkers. He is leading the effort at Lincoln Laboratory to develop READY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"READY stands for Rapid Evaluation of Attention for DutY, and is built on the premise that attention is the key to being 'ready' for a mission,\" he says. \"In one view, we can think of attention as the mental state that allows you to focus on a task.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone to be attentive, their brain must continuously anticipate and process incoming sensory information and then instruct the body to respond appropriately. For example, if a friend yells \"catch\" and then throws a ball in your direction, in order to catch that ball, your brain must process the incoming auditory and visual data, predict in advance what may happen in the next few moments, and then direct your body to respond with an action that synchronizes those sensory data. The result? You realize from hearing the word \"catch\" and seeing the moving ball that your friend is throwing the ball to you, and you reach out a hand to catch it just in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"An unhealthy or fatigued brain — caused by TBI or sleep deprivation, for example — may have challenges within a neurosensory feed-forward [prediction] or feedback [error] system, thus hampering the person's ability to attend,\" Quatieri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READY's three tests measure a person’s ability to track a moving dot with their eye, balance, and hold a vowel fixed at one pitch. The app then uses the data to calculate a variability or \"wobble\" indicator, which represents changes from the test taker's baseline or from expected results based on others with similar demographics, or the general population. The results are displayed to the user as an indication of the patient's level of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the READY screen shows an impairment, the administrator can then direct the subject to follow up with MINDSCAPE, which stands for Mobile Interface for Neurological Diagnostic Situational Cognitive Assessment and Psychological Evaluation. MINDSCAPE uses VR technology to administer additional, in-depth tests to measure cognitive functions such as reaction time and working memory. These standard neurocognitive tests are recorded with multimodal physiological sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG), photoplethysmography, and pupillometry, to better pinpoint diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic and adaptable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key advantage of READY and MINDSCAPE is their ability to leverage existing technologies, allowing for rapid deployment in the field. By utilizing sensors and capabilities already integrated into smartphones, tablets, and VR devices, these assessment tools can be easily adapted for use in operational settings at a significantly reduced cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We can immediately apply our advanced algorithms to the data collected from these devices, without the need for costly and time-consuming hardware development,\" Smalt says. \"By harnessing the capabilities of commercially available technologies, we can quickly provide valuable insights and improve upon traditional assessment methods.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing new capabilities and AI for brain-health sensing into operational environments is a theme across several projects at the laboratory. Another example is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/fifteen-lincoln-laboratory-technologies-receive-rd-100-awards\"&gt;EYEBOOM&lt;/a&gt; (Electrooculography and Balance Blast Overpressure Monitoring System), a wearable technology developed for the U.S. Special Forces to monitor blast exposure. EYEBOOM continuously monitors a wearer's eye and body movements as they experience blast energy, and warns of potential harm. For this program, the laboratory developed an algorithm that could identify a potential change in physiology resulting from blast exposure during operations, rather than waiting for a check-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three technologies are in development to be versatile, so they can be adapted for other relevant uses. For example, a workflow could pair EYEBOOM's monitoring capabilities with the READY and MINDSCAPE tests: EYEBOOM would continuously monitor for exposure risk and then prompt the wearer to seek additional assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of times, research focuses on one specific modality, whereas what we do at the laboratory is search for a holistic solution that can be applied for many different purposes,\" Smalt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINDSCAPE is undergoing testing at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://walterreed.tricare.mil/\"&gt;Walter Reed National Military Center&lt;/a&gt; this year. READY will be tested with the&amp;nbsp;U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) in 2026 in the context of sleep deprivation. Smalt and Quatieri also see the technologies finding use in civilian settings — on sporting event sidelines, in doctors' offices, or wherever else there is a need to assess brain readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINDSCAPE is being developed with clinical validation and support from Stefanie Kuchinsky at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Quatieri and his team are developing the READY tests in collaboration with Jun Maruta and Jam Ghajar from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://braintrauma.org/\"&gt;Brain Trauma Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (BTF), and Kristin Heaton from USARIEM. The tests are supported by concurrent evidence-based guidelines lead by the BTF and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://mtbi2.usuhs.edu/\"&gt;Military TBI Initiative&lt;/a&gt; at Uniform Services University.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-lincoln-Brain-Health-Military.jpg?itok=gtPYkumz\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Lincoln Laboratory researchers are building rapid brain health screening capabilities for military service members.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Tammy Ko/Lincoln Laboratory</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/brain-cognitive\">Brain and cognitive sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/neuroscience\">Neuroscience</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/diagnostic-devices\">Diagnostic devices</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biomedical-sensors\">Biomedical sensors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/augmented-and-virtual-reality\">Augmented and virtual reality</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/security-studies\">Security studies and military</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mobile-applications\">Mobile applications</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health-care\">Health care</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sports\">Sports and fitness</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lincoln-laboratory-0\">Lincoln Laboratory</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Can large language models figure out the real world?</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-large-language-models-figure-out-real-world-0825</link>\n  <description>New test could help determine if AI systems that make accurate predictions in one area can understand it well enough to apply that ability to a different area.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-large-language-models-figure-out-real-world-0825</guid>\n        <dc:creator>David Chandler | Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in the 17th century, German astronomer Johannes Kepler figured out the laws of motion that made it possible to accurately predict where our solar system’s planets would appear in the sky as they orbit the sun. But it wasn’t until decades later, when Isaac Newton formulated the universal laws of gravitation, that the underlying principles were understood. Although they were inspired by Kepler’s laws, they went much further, and made it possible to apply the same formulas to everything from the trajectory of a cannon ball to the way the moon’s pull controls the tides on Earth — or how to launch a satellite from Earth to the surface of the moon or planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s sophisticated artificial intelligence systems have gotten very good at making the kind of specific predictions that resemble Kepler’s orbit predictions. But do they know why these predictions work, with the kind of deep understanding that comes from basic principles like Newton’s laws? As the world grows ever-more dependent on these kinds of AI systems, researchers are struggling to try to measure just how they do what they do, and how deep their understanding of the real world actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and at Harvard University have devised a new approach to assessing how deeply these predictive systems understand their subject matter, and whether they can apply knowledge from one domain to a slightly different one. And by and large the answer at this point, in the examples they studied, is — not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/44374\"&gt;findings were presented&lt;/a&gt; at the International Conference on Machine Learning, in Vancouver, British Columbia, last month by Harvard postdoc Keyon Vafa, MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and LIDS affiliate Peter G. Chang, MIT assistant professor and LIDS principal investigator Ashesh Rambachan, and MIT professor, LIDS principal investigator, and senior author Sendhil Mullainathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans all the time have been able to make this transition from good predictions to world models,” says Vafa, the study’s lead author. So the question their team was addressing was, “have foundation models — has AI — been able to make that leap from predictions to world models? And we’re not asking are they capable, or can they, or will they. It’s just, have they done it so far?” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know how to test whether an algorithm predicts well. But what we need is a way to test for whether it has understood well,” says Mullainathan, the Peter de Florez Professor with dual appointments in the MIT departments of Economics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the senior author on the study. “Even defining what understanding means was a challenge.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Kepler versus Newton analogy, Vafa says, “they both had models that worked really well on one task, and that worked essentially the same way on that task. What Newton offered was ideas that were able to generalize to new tasks.” That capability, when applied to the predictions made by various AI systems, would entail having it develop a world model so it can “transcend the task that you’re working on and be able to generalize to new kinds of problems and paradigms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another analogy that helps to illustrate the point is the difference between centuries of accumulated knowledge of how to selectively breed crops and animals, versus Gregor Mendel’s insight into the underlying laws of genetic inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of excitement in the field about using foundation models to not just perform tasks, but to learn something about the world,” for example in the natural sciences, he says. “It would need to adapt, have a world model to adapt to any possible task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are AI systems anywhere near the ability to reach such generalizations? To test the question, the team looked at different examples of predictive AI systems, at different levels of complexity. On the very simplest of examples, the systems succeeded in creating a realistic model of the simulated system, but as the examples got more complex that ability faded fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a new metric, a way of measuring quantitatively how well a system approximates real-world conditions. They call the measurement inductive bias — that is, a tendency or bias toward responses that reflect reality, based on inferences developed from looking at vast amounts of data on specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest level of examples they looked at was known as a lattice model. In a one-dimensional lattice, something can move only along a line. Vafa compares it to a frog jumping between lily pads in a row. As the frog jumps or sits, it calls out what it’s doing — right, left, or stay. If it reaches the last lily pad in the row, it can only stay or go back. If someone, or an AI system, can just hear the calls, without knowing anything about the number of lily pads, can it figure out the configuration? The answer is yes: Predictive models do well at reconstructing the “world” in such a simple case. But even with lattices, as you increase the number of dimensions, the systems no longer can make that leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in a two-state or three-state lattice, we showed that the model does have a pretty good inductive bias toward the actual state,” says Chang. “But as we increase the number of states, then it starts to have a divergence from real-world models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complex problem is a system that can play the board game Othello, which involves players alternately placing black or white disks on a grid. The AI models can accurately predict what moves are allowable at a given point, but it turns out they do badly at inferring what the overall arrangement of pieces on the board is, including ones that are currently blocked from play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then looked at five different categories of predictive models actually in use, and again, the more complex the systems involved, the more poorly the predictive modes performed at matching the true underlying world model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new metric of inductive bias, “our hope is to provide a kind of test bed where you can evaluate different models, different training approaches, on problems where we know what the true world model is,” Vafa says. If it performs well on these cases where we already know the underlying reality, then we can have greater faith that its predictions may be useful even in cases “where we don’t really know what the truth is,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are already trying to use these kinds of predictive AI systems to aid in scientific discovery, including such things as properties of chemical compounds that have never actually been created, or of potential pharmaceutical compounds, or for predicting the folding behavior and properties of unknown protein molecules. “For the more realistic problems,” Vafa says, “even for something like basic mechanics, we found that there seems to be a long way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang says, “There’s been a lot of hype around foundation models, where people are trying to build domain-specific foundation models — biology-based foundation models, physics-based foundation models, robotics foundation models, foundation models for other types of domains where people have been collecting a ton of data” and training these models to make predictions, “and then hoping that it acquires some knowledge of the domain itself, to be used for other downstream tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work shows there’s a long way to go, but it also helps to show a path forward. “Our paper suggests that we can apply our metrics to evaluate how much the representation is learning, so that we can come up with better ways of training foundation models, or at least evaluate the models that we’re training currently,” Chang says. “As an engineering field, once we have a metric for something, people are really, really good at optimizing that metric.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/Foundation-models.jpg?itok=IXXXhTI8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers at MIT and Harvard University have devised a new approach to assessing how deeply predictive AI systems understand their subject matter, and whether they can apply knowledge from one domain to a slightly different one. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/economics\">Economics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A new model predicts how molecules will dissolve in different solvents</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819</link>\n  <description>Solubility predictions could make it easier to design and synthesize new drugs, while minimizing the use of more hazardous solvents.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, MIT chemical engineers have created a computational model that can predict how well any given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent — a key step in the synthesis of nearly any pharmaceutical. This type of prediction could make it much easier to develop new ways to produce drugs and other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which predicts how much of a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent, should help chemists to choose the right solvent for any given reaction in their synthesis, the researchers say. Common organic solvents include ethanol and acetone, and there are hundreds of others that can also be used in chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Predicting solubility really is a rate-limiting step in synthetic planning and manufacturing of chemicals, especially drugs, so there’s been a longstanding interest in being able to make better predictions of solubility,” says Lucas Attia, an MIT graduate student and one of the lead authors of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://askcos.mit.edu/solprop?tab=solpred\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; freely available, and many companies and labs have already started using it. The model could be particularly useful for identifying solvents that are less hazardous than some of the most commonly used industrial solvents, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some solvents which are known to dissolve most things. They’re really useful, but they’re damaging to the environment, and they’re damaging to people, so many companies require that you have to minimize the amount of those solvents that you use,” says Jackson Burns, an MIT graduate student who is also a lead author of the paper. “Our model is extremely useful in being able to identify the next-best solvent, which is hopefully much less damaging to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Green, the Hoyt Hottel Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the MIT Energy Initiative, is the senior author of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62717-7\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering, is also an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving solubility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model grew out of a project that Attia and Burns worked on together in an MIT course&amp;nbsp;on applying machine learning to chemical engineering problems. Traditionally, chemists have predicted solubility with a tool known as the Abraham Solvation Model, which can be used to estimate a molecule’s overall solubility by adding up the contributions of chemical structures within the molecule. While these predictions are useful, their accuracy is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, researchers have begun using machine learning to try to make more accurate solubility predictions. Before Burns and Attia began working on their new model, the state-of-the-art model for predicting solubility was a model developed in Green’s lab in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model, known as SolProp, works by predicting a set of related properties and combining them, using thermodynamics, to ultimately predict the solubility. However, the model has difficulty predicting solubility for solutes that it hasn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For drug and chemical discovery pipelines where you’re developing a new molecule, you want to be able to predict ahead of time what its solubility looks like,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that existing solubility models haven’t worked well is because there wasn’t a comprehensive dataset to train them on. However, in 2023 a new dataset called BigSolDB was released, which compiled data from nearly 800 published papers, including information on solubility for about 800 molecules dissolved about more than 100 organic solvents that are commonly used in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia and Burns decided to try training two different types of models on this data. Both of these models represent the chemical structures of molecules using numerical representations known as embeddings, which incorporate information such as the number of atoms in a molecule and which atoms are bound to which other atoms. Models can then use these representations to predict a variety of chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the models used in this study, known as FastProp and developed by Burns and others in Green’s lab, incorporates “static embeddings.” This means that the model already knows the embedding for each molecule before it starts doing any kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other model, ChemProp, learns an embedding for each molecule during the training, at the same time that it learns to associate the features of the embedding with a trait such as solubility. This model, developed across multiple MIT labs, has already been used for tasks such as antibiotic discovery, lipid nanoparticle design, and predicting chemical reaction rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained both types of models on over 40,000 data points from BigSolDB, including information on the effects of temperature, which plays a significant role in solubility. Then, they tested the models on about 1,000 solutes that had been withheld from the training data. They found that the models’ predictions were two to three times more accurate than those of SolProp, the previous best model, and the new models were especially accurate at predicting variations in solubility due to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to accurately reproduce those small variations in solubility due to temperature, even when the overarching experimental noise is very large, was a really positive sign that the network had correctly learned an underlying solubility prediction function,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had expected that the model based on ChemProp, which is able to learn new representations as it goes along, would be able to make more accurate predictions. However, to their surprise, they found that the two models performed essentially the same. That suggests that the main limitation on their performance is the quality of the data, and that the models are performing as well as theoretically possible based on the data that they’re using, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChemProp should always outperform any static embedding when you have sufficient data,” Burns says. “We were blown away to see that the static and learned embeddings were statistically indistinguishable in performance across all the different subsets, which indicates to us that that the data limitations that are present in this space dominated the model performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models could become more accurate, the researchers say, if better training and testing data were available — ideally, data obtained by one person or a group of people all trained to perform the experiments the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big limitations of using these kinds of compiled datasets is that different labs use different methods and experimental conditions when they perform solubility tests. That contributes to this variability between different datasets,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model based on FastProp makes its predictions faster and has code that is easier for other users to adapt, the researchers decided to make that one, known as FastSolv, available to the public. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have already begun using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are applications throughout the drug discovery pipeline,” Burns says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re also excited to see, outside of formulation and drug discovery, where people may use this model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Predict-Solubility-01-press.jpg?itok=NlJyl9z7\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT chemical engineers created a computational model that can predict how well a given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the researchers; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-development\">Drug development</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pharmaceuticals\">Pharmaceuticals</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemistry-0\">Chemistry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cleaner-industry\">Cleaner industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Researchers glimpse the inner workings of protein language models</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-glimpse-inner-workings-protein-language-models-0818</link>\n  <description>A new approach can reveal the features AI models use to predict proteins that might make good drug or vaccine targets.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-glimpse-inner-workings-protein-language-models-0818</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Within the past few years, models that can predict the structure or function of proteins have been widely used for a variety of biological applications, such as identifying drug targets and designing new therapeutic antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models, which are based on large language models (LLMs), can make very accurate predictions of a protein’s suitability for a given application. However, there’s no way to determine how these models make their predictions or which protein features play the most important role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, MIT researchers have used a novel technique to open up that “black box” and allow them to determine what features a protein language model takes into account when making predictions. Understanding what is happening inside that black box&amp;nbsp;could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work has broad implications for enhanced explainability in downstream tasks that rely on these representations,” says Bonnie Berger, the Simons Professor of Mathematics, head of the Computation and Biology group in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the senior author of the study. “Additionally, identifying features that protein language models track has the potential to reveal novel biological insights from these representations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onkar Gujral, an MIT graduate student, is the lead author of the open-access &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2506316122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/em&gt; Mihir Bafna, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, and Eric Alm, an MIT professor of biological engineering, are also authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening the black box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Berger and former MIT graduate student Tristan Bepler PhD ’20 &lt;a href=\"https://openreview.net/revisions?id=SygLehCqtm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; the first protein language model. Their model, like subsequent protein models that accelerated the development of&amp;nbsp;AlphaFold, such as&amp;nbsp;ESM2 and OmegaFold, was based on LLMs. These models, which include ChatGPT, can analyze huge amounts of text and figure out which words are most likely to appear together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein language models use a similar approach, but instead of analyzing words, they analyze amino acid sequences. Researchers have used these models to predict the structure and function of proteins, and for applications such as identifying proteins that might bind to particular drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/model-viruses-escape-immune-0114\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, Berger and colleagues used a protein language model to predict which sections of viral surface proteins are less likely to mutate in a way that enables viral escape. This allowed them to identify possible targets for vaccines against influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in all of these studies, it has been impossible to know how the models were making their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would get out some prediction at the end, but we had absolutely no idea what was happening in the individual components of this black box,” Berger says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers wanted to dig into how protein language models make their predictions. Just like LLMs, protein language models encode information as representations that consist of a pattern of activation of different “nodes” within a neural network. These nodes are analogous to the networks of neurons that store memories and other information within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inner workings of LLMs are not easy to interpret, but within the past couple of years, researchers have begun using a type of algorithm known as a sparse autoencoder to help shed some light on how those models make their predictions. The new study from Berger’s lab is the first to use this algorithm on protein language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparse autoencoders work by adjusting how a protein is represented within a neural network. Typically, a given protein will be represented by a pattern of activation of a constrained number of neurons, for example, 480. A sparse autoencoder will expand that representation into a much larger number of nodes, say 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When information about a protein is encoded by only 480 neurons, each node lights up for multiple features, making it very difficult to know what features each node is encoding. However, when the neural network is expanded to 20,000 nodes, this extra space along with a sparsity constraint gives the information room to “spread out.” Now, a feature of the protein that was previously encoded by multiple nodes can occupy a single node.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sparse representation, the neurons lighting up are doing so in a more meaningful manner,” Gujral says. “Before the sparse representations are created, the networks pack information so tightly together that it's hard to interpret the neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpretable models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers obtained sparse representations of many proteins, they used an AI assistant called Claude (related to the popular Anthropic chatbot of the same name), to analyze the representations. In this case, they asked Claude to compare the sparse representations with the known features of each protein, such as molecular function, protein family, or location within a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing thousands of representations, Claude can determine which nodes correspond to specific protein features, then describe them in plain English. For example, the algorithm might say, “This neuron appears to be detecting proteins involved in transmembrane transport of ions or amino acids, particularly those located in the plasma membrane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process makes the nodes far more “interpretable,” meaning the researchers can tell what each node is encoding. They found that the features most likely to be encoded by these nodes were protein family and certain functions, including several different metabolic and biosynthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you train a sparse autoencoder, you aren’t training it to be interpretable, but it turns out that by incentivizing the representation to be really sparse, that ends up resulting in interpretability,” Gujral says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what features a particular protein model is encoding could help researchers choose the right model for a particular task, or tweak the type of input they give the model, to generate the best results. Additionally, analyzing the features that a model encodes could one day help biologists to learn more about the proteins that they are studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point when the models get a lot more powerful, you could learn more biology than you already know, from opening up the models,” Gujral says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-model-interpret-01-press.jpg?itok=nA-s3rBF\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Understanding what is happening inside the “black box” of large protein models could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/proteins\">Proteins</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-discovery\">Drug discovery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>How AI could speed the development of RNA vaccines and other RNA therapies</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-ai-could-speed-development-rna-vaccines-and-other-rna-therapies-0815</link>\n  <description>MIT engineers used a machine-learning model to design nanoparticles that can deliver RNA to cells more efficiently.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-ai-could-speed-development-rna-vaccines-and-other-rna-therapies-0815</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have come up with a new way to design nanoparticles that can more efficiently deliver RNA vaccines and other types of RNA therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training a machine-learning model to analyze thousands of existing delivery particles, the researchers used it to predict new materials that would work even better. The model also enabled the researchers to identify particles that would work well in different types of cells, and to discover ways to incorporate new types of materials into the particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we did was apply machine-learning tools to help accelerate the identification of optimal ingredient mixtures in lipid nanoparticles to help target a different cell type or help incorporate different materials, much faster than previously was possible,” says Giovanni Traverso,&amp;nbsp;an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital,&amp;nbsp;and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could dramatically speed the process of developing new RNA vaccines, as well as therapies that could be used to treat obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvin Chan, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University, and Ameya Kirtane, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, are the lead authors of the new open-access study, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01975-4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particle predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA vaccines, such as the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, are usually packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for delivery. These particles protect mRNA from being broken down in the body and help it to enter cells once injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating particles that handle these jobs more efficiently could help researchers to develop even more effective vaccines. Better delivery vehicles could also make it easier to develop mRNA therapies that encode genes for proteins that could help to treat a variety of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Traverso’s lab launched a multiyear&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-led-team-receives-funding-new-treatments-metabolic-disease-0205\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;research program&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), to develop new ingestible devices that could achieve oral delivery of RNA treatments and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of what we’re trying to do is develop ways of producing more protein, for example, for therapeutic applications. Maximizing the efficiency is important to be able to boost how much we can have the cells produce,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical LNP consists of four components — a cholesterol, a helper lipid, an ionizable lipid, and a lipid that is attached to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Different variants of each of these components can be swapped in to create a huge number of possible combinations. Changing up these formulations and testing each one individually is very time-consuming, so Traverso, Chan, and their colleagues decided to turn to artificial intelligence to help speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most AI models in drug discovery focus on optimizing a single compound at a time, but that approach doesn’t work for lipid nanoparticles, which are made of multiple interacting components,” Chan says. “To tackle this, we developed a new model called COMET, inspired by the same transformer architecture that powers large language models like ChatGPT. Just as those models understand how words combine to form meaning, COMET learns how different chemical components come together in a nanoparticle to influence its properties — like how well it can deliver RNA into cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate training data for their machine-learning model, the researchers created a library of about 3,000 different LNP formulations. The team tested each of these 3,000 particles in the lab to see how efficiently they could deliver their payload to cells, then fed all of this data into a machine-learning model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the model was trained, the researchers asked it to predict new formulations that would work better than existing LNPs. They tested those predictions by using the new formulations to deliver mRNA encoding a fluorescent protein to mouse skin cells grown in a lab dish. They found that the LNPs predicted by the model did indeed work better than the particles in the training data, and in some cases better than LNP formulations that are used commercially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerated development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers showed that the model could accurately predict particles that would efficiently deliver mRNA, they began asking additional questions. First, they wondered if they could train the model on nanoparticles that incorporate a fifth component: a type of polymer known as branched poly beta amino esters (PBAEs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by Traverso and his colleagues has shown that these polymers can effectively deliver nucleic acids on their own, so they wanted to explore whether adding them to LNPs could improve LNP performance. The MIT team created a set of about 300 LNPs that also include these polymers, which they used to train the model. The resulting model could then predict additional formulations with PBAEs that would work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers set out to train the model to make predictions about LNPs that would work best in different types of cells, including a type of cell called Caco-2, which is derived from colorectal cancer cells. Again, the model was able to predict LNPs that would efficiently deliver mRNA to these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the researchers used the model to predict which LNPs could best withstand lyophilization — a freeze-drying process often used to extend the shelf-life of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a tool that allows us to adapt it to a whole different set of questions and help accelerate development. We did a large training set that went into the model, but then you can do much more focused experiments and get outputs that are helpful on very different kinds of questions,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues are now working on incorporating some of these particles into potential treatments for diabetes and obesity, which are two of the primary targets of the ARPA-H funded project. Therapeutics that could be delivered using this approach include GLP-1 mimics with similar effects to Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by the GO Nano Marble Center at the Koch Institute, the Karl van Tassel Career Development Professorship, the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and ARPA-H.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-AI-Nanoparticles-01-press.jpg?itok=s93vqVvn\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“What we did was apply machine-learning tools to help accelerate the identification of optimal ingredient mixtures in lipid nanoparticles to help target a different cell type or help incorporate different materials, much faster than previously was possible,” says Giovanni Traverso.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the researchers; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/rna\">RNA</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/vaccines\">Vaccines</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-delivery\">Drug delivery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-discovery\">Drug discovery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Using generative AI, researchers design compounds that can kill drug-resistant bacteria</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/using-generative-ai-researchers-design-compounds-kill-drug-resistant-bacteria-0814</link>\n  <description>The team used two different AI approaches to design novel antibiotics, including one that showed promise against MRSA.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/using-generative-ai-researchers-design-compounds-kill-drug-resistant-bacteria-0814</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have designed novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; and multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(MRSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI algorithms, the research team designed more than 36 million possible compounds and computationally screened them for antimicrobial properties. The top candidates they discovered are structurally distinct from any existing antibiotics, and they appear to work by novel mechanisms that disrupt bacterial cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed the researchers to generate and evaluate theoretical compounds that have never been seen before — a strategy that they now hope to apply to identify and design compounds with activity against other species of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the new possibilities that this project opens up for antibiotics development. Our work shows the power of AI from a drug design standpoint, and enables us to exploit much larger chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible,” says James Collins,&amp;nbsp;the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering, and a member of the Broad Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00855-4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are MIT postdoc Aarti Krishnan, former postdoc Melis Anahtar ’08, and Jacqueline Valeri PhD ’23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring chemical space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 45 years, a few dozen&amp;nbsp;new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, but most of these are variants of existing antibiotics. At the same time, bacterial resistance to many of these drugs has been growing. Globally, it is estimated that drug-resistant bacterial infections cause nearly 5 million deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of finding new antibiotics to fight this growing problem, Collins and others at MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/collins-lab\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Antibiotics-AI Project&lt;/a&gt; have harnessed the power of AI to screen huge libraries of existing chemical compounds. This work has yielded several promising drug candidates, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;halicin&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/using-ai-scientists-combat-drug-resistant-infections-0525\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;abaucin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on that progress, Collins and his colleagues decided to expand their search into molecules that can’t be found in any chemical libraries. By using AI to generate hypothetically possible molecules that don’t exist or haven’t been discovered, they realized that it should be possible to explore a much greater diversity of potential drug compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers employed two different approaches: First, they directed generative AI algorithms to design molecules based on a specific chemical fragment that showed antimicrobial activity, and second, they let the algorithms freely generate molecules, without having to include a specific fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fragment-based approach, the researchers sought to identify molecules that could kill &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhea. They began by assembling a library of about 45 million known chemical fragments, consisting of all possible combinations of 11 atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur, along with fragments from Enamine’s REadily AccessibLe (REAL) space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they screened the library using machine-learning models that Collins’ lab has previously trained to predict antibacterial activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This resulted in nearly 4 million fragments. They narrowed down that pool by removing any fragments predicted to be cytotoxic to human cells, displayed chemical liabilities, and were known to be similar to existing antibiotics. This left them with about 1 million candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get rid of anything that would look like an existing antibiotic, to help address the antimicrobial resistance crisis in a fundamentally different way. By venturing into underexplored areas of chemical space, our goal was to uncover novel mechanisms of action,” Krishnan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through several rounds of additional experiments and computational analysis, the researchers identified a fragment they called F1 that appeared to have promising activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. They used this fragment as the basis for generating additional compounds, using two different generative AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those algorithms, known as chemically reasonable mutations (CReM), works by starting with a particular molecule containing F1 and then generating new molecules by adding, replacing, or deleting atoms and chemical groups. The second algorithm, F-VAE (fragment-based variational autoencoder), takes a chemical fragment and builds it into a complete molecule. It does so by learning patterns of how fragments are commonly modified, based on its pretraining on more than 1 million molecules from the ChEMBL database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two algorithms generated about 7 million candidates containing F1, which the researchers then computationally screened for activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This screen yielded about 1,000 compounds, and the researchers selected 80 of those to see if they could be produced by chemical synthesis vendors. Only two of these could be synthesized, and one of them, named NG1, was very effective at killing &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; in a lab dish and in a mouse model of drug-resistant gonorrhea infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional experiments revealed that NG1 interacts with a protein called LptA, a novel drug target involved in the synthesis of the bacterial outer membrane. It appears that the drug works by interfering with membrane synthesis, which is fatal to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconstrained design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second round of studies, the researchers explored the potential of using generative AI to freely design molecules, using Gram-positive bacteria, &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; as their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the researchers used CReM and VAE to generate molecules, but this time with no constraints other than the general rules of how atoms can join to form chemically plausible molecules. Together, the models generated more than 29 million compounds. The researchers then applied the same filters that they did to the &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; candidates, but focusing on &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;, eventually narrowing the pool down to about 90 compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were able to synthesize and test 22 of these molecules, and six of them showed strong antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;grown in a lab dish. They also found that the top candidate, named DN1, was able to clear a methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) skin infection in a mouse model. These molecules also appear to interfere with bacterial cell membranes, but with broader effects not limited to interaction with one specific protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phare Bio, a nonprofit that is also part of the Antibiotics-AI Project, is now working on further modifying NG1 and DN1 to make them suitable for additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a collaboration with Phare Bio, we are exploring analogs, as well as working on advancing the best candidates preclinically, through medicinal chemistry work,” Collins says. “We are also excited about applying the platforms that Aarti and the team have developed toward other bacterial pathogens of interest, notably &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense&amp;nbsp;Threat Reduction Agency, the&amp;nbsp;National Institutes of Health,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Audacious Project, Flu Lab, the Sea Grape Foundation, Rosamund Zander and Hansjorg Wyss for the Wyss Foundation, and an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Novel-Antibiotics-01.jpg?itok=hrC95Mtj\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have discovered novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: a drug-resistant form of gonorrhea and multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock, MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-resistance\">Drug resistance</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/microbes\">Microbes</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/disease\">Disease</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/bacteria\">Bacteria</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/antibiotics\">Antibiotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-development\">Drug development</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/institute-medical-engineering-and-science-imes-0\">Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A new way to test how well AI systems classify text</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-way-test-how-well-ai-systems-classify-text-0813</link>\n  <description>As large language models increasingly dominate our everyday lives, new systems for checking their reliability are more important than ever.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-way-test-how-well-ai-systems-classify-text-0813</guid>\n        <dc:creator>David Chandler | MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Is this movie review a rave or a pan? Is this news story about business or technology? Is this online chatbot conversation veering off into giving financial advice? Is this online medical information site giving out misinformation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of automated conversations, whether they involve seeking a movie or restaurant review or getting information about your bank account or health records, are becoming increasingly prevalent. More than ever, such evaluations are being made by highly sophisticated algorithms, known as text classifiers, rather than by human beings. But how can we tell how accurate these classifications really are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) has come up with an innovative approach to not only measure how well these classifiers are doing their job, but then go one step further and show how to make them more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new evaluation and remediation software was led and developed by Lei Xu alongside the research conducted by Sarah Alnegheimish, Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a principal research scientist at LIDS and senior author, with two others. The software package is being made freely available for download by anyone who wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standard method for testing these classification systems is to create what are known as&amp;nbsp;synthetic examples — sentences that closely resemble ones that have already been classified. For example, researchers might take a sentence that has already been tagged by a classifier program as being a rave review, and see if changing a word or a few words while retaining the same meaning could fool the classifier into deeming it a pan. Or a sentence that was determined to be misinformation might get misclassified as accurate. This ability to fool the classifiers makes these adversarial examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have tried various ways to find the vulnerabilities in these classifiers, Veeramachaneni says. But existing methods of finding these vulnerabilities have a hard time with this task and miss many examples that they should catch, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, companies are trying to use such evaluation tools in real time, monitoring the output of chatbots used for various purposes to try to make sure they are not putting out improper responses. For example, a bank might use a chatbot to respond to routine customer queries such as checking account balances or applying for a credit card, but it wants to ensure that its responses could never be interpreted as financial advice, which could expose the company to liability. “Before showing the chatbot’s response to the end user, they want to use the text classifier to detect whether it’s giving financial advice or not,” Veeramachaneni says. But then it’s important to test that classifier to see how reliable its evaluations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These chatbots, or summarization engines or whatnot are being set up across the board,” he says, to deal with external customers and within an organization as well, for example providing information about HR issues. It’s important to put these text classifiers into the loop to detect things that they are not supposed to say, and filter those out before the output gets transmitted to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where the use of adversarial examples comes in — those sentences that have already been classified but then produce a different response when they are slightly modified while retaining the same meaning. How can people confirm that the meaning is the same? By using another large language model (LLM) that interprets and compares meanings. So, if the LLM says the two sentences mean the same thing, but the classifier labels them differently, “that is a sentence that is adversarial — it can fool the classifier,” Veeramachaneni says. And when the researchers examined these adversarial sentences, “we found that most of the time, this was just a one-word change,” although the people using LLMs to generate these alternate sentences often didn’t realize that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation, using LLMs to analyze many thousands of examples, showed that certain specific words had an outsized influence in changing the classifications, and therefore the testing of a classifier’s accuracy could focus on this small subset of words that seem to make the most difference. They found that one-tenth of 1 percent of all the 30,000 words in the system’s vocabulary could account for almost half of all these reversals of classification, in some specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lei Xu PhD ’23, a recent graduate from LIDS who performed much of the analysis as part of his thesis work, “used a lot of interesting estimation techniques to figure out what are the most powerful words that can change the overall classification, that can fool the classifier,” Veeramachaneni says. The goal is to make it possible to do much more narrowly targeted searches, rather than combing through all possible word substitutions, thus making the computational task of generating adversarial examples much more manageable. “He’s using large language models, interestingly enough, as a way to understand the power of a single word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, also using LLMs, he&amp;nbsp;searches for other words that are closely related to these powerful words, and so on, allowing for an overall ranking of words according to their influence on the outcomes. Once these adversarial sentences have been found, they can be used in turn to retrain the classifier to take them into account, increasing the robustness of the classifier against those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making classifiers more accurate may not sound like a big deal if it’s just a matter of classifying news articles into categories, or deciding whether reviews of anything from movies to restaurants are positive or negative. But increasingly, classifiers are being used in settings where the outcomes really do matter, whether preventing the inadvertent release of sensitive medical, financial, or security information, or helping to guide important research, such as into properties of chemical compounds or the folding of proteins for biomedical applications, or in identifying and blocking hate speech or known misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this research, the team introduced a new metric, which they call p, which provides a measure of how robust a given classifier is against single-word attacks. And because of the importance of such misclassifications, the research team has made its products available as open access for anyone to use. The package consists of two components: SP-Attack, which generates adversarial sentences to test classifiers in any particular application, and SP-Defense, which aims to improve the robustness of the classifier by generating and using adversarial sentences to retrain the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some tests, where competing methods of testing classifier outputs allowed a 66 percent success rate by adversarial attacks, this team’s system cut that attack success rate almost in half, to 33.7 percent. In other applications, the improvement was as little as a 2 percent difference, but even that can be quite important, Veeramachaneni says, since these systems are being used for so many billions of interactions that even a small percentage can affect millions of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s results were published on July 7 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Expert Systems&lt;/em&gt; in a paper by Xu, Veeramachaneni, and Alnegheimish of LIDS, along with Laure Berti-Equille at IRD in Marseille, France, and Alfredo Cuesta-Infante at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, in Spain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-lids-text-classifier.jpg?itok=EFDHW0eB\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new approach measures how well text classifiers are doing their job, and shows how to make them more accurate.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-access\">Open access</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT gears up to transform manufacturing</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-gears-transform-manufacturing-0813</link>\n  <description>The Initiative for New Manufacturing is convening experts across the Institute to drive a transformation of production across the U.S. and the world.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-gears-transform-manufacturing-0813</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Eric Bender | MIT Industrial Liaison Program</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturing is the engine of society, and it is the backbone of robust, resilient economies,” says John Hart, head of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) and faculty co-director of the MIT &lt;a href=\"http://inm.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Initiative for New Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; (INM). “With manufacturing a lively topic in today’s news, there’s a renewed appreciation and understanding of the importance of manufacturing to innovation, to economic and national security, and to daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched this May, INM will “help create a transformation of manufacturing through new technology, through development of talent, and through an understanding of how to scale manufacturing in a way that enables imparts higher productivity and resilience, drives adoption of new technologies, and creates good jobs,” Hart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM is one of MIT’s strategic initiatives and builds on the successful three-year-old Manufacturing@MIT program. “It’s a recognition by MIT that manufacturing is an Institute-wide theme and an Institute-wide priority, and that manufacturing connects faculty and students across campus,” says Hart. Alongside Hart, INM’s faculty co-directors are Institute Professor Suzanne Berger and Chris Love, professor of chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is pursuing four main themes: reimagining manufacturing technologies and systems, elevating the productivity and human experience of manufacturing, scaling up new manufacturing, and transforming the manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking manufacturing barriers for corporations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen, Autodesk, Flex, GE Vernova, PTC, Sanofi, and Siemens are founding members of INM’s industry consortium. These industry partners will work closely with MIT faculty, researchers,&amp;nbsp;and students across many aspects of manufacturing-related research, both in broad-scale initiatives and in particular areas of shared interests. Membership requires a minimum three-year commitment of $500,000 a year to manufacturing-related activities at MIT, including the INM membership fee of $275,000 per year, which supports several core activities that engage the industry members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major thrust for INM industry collaboration is the deployment and adoption of AI and automation in manufacturing. This effort will include seed research projects at MIT, collaborative case studies, and shared strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM also offers companies participation in the MIT-wide New Manufacturing Research effort, which is studying the trajectories of specific manufacturing industries and examining cross-cutting themes such as technology and financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, INM will concentrate on education for all professions in manufacturing, with alliances bringing together corporations, community colleges, government agencies, and other partners. “We'll scale our curriculum to broader audiences, from aspiring manufacturing workers and aspiring production line supervisors all the way up to engineers and executives,” says Hart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In workforce training, INM will collaborate with companies broadly to help understand the challenges and frame its overall workforce agenda, and with individual firms on specific challenges, such as acquiring suitably prepared employees for a new factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, industry partners will also engage directly with students. Founding member Flex, for instance, hosted MIT researchers and students at the Flex Institute of Technology in Sorocaba, Brazil, developing new solutions for electronics manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“History shows that you need to innovate in manufacturing alongside the innovation in products,” Hart comments. “At MIT, as more students take classes in manufacturing, they’ll think more about key manufacturing issues as they decide what research problems they want to solve, or what choices they make as they prototype their devices. The same is true for industry — companies that operate at the frontier of manufacturing, whether through internal capabilities or their supply chains, are positioned to be on the frontier of product innovation and overall growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll have an opportunity to bring manufacturing upstream to the early stage of research, designing new processes and new devices with scalability in mind,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MIT expects to open new manufacturing-related labs and to further broaden cooperation with industry at existing shared facilities, such as MIT.nano. Hart says that facilities will also invite tighter collaborations with corporations — not just providing advanced equipment, but working jointly on, say, new technologies for weaving textiles, or speeding up battery manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homing in on the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM is a global project that brings a particular focus on the United States, which remains the world’s second-largest manufacturing economy, but has suffered a significant decline in manufacturing employment and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key to reversing this trend and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing base is advocacy for manufacturing’s critical role in society and the career opportunities it offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one really disputes the importance of manufacturing,” Hart says. “But we need to elevate interest in manufacturing as a rewarding career, from the production workers to manufacturing engineers and leaders, through advocacy, education programs, and buy-in from industry, government, and academia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT is in a unique position to convene industry, academic, and government stakeholders in manufacturing to work together on this vital issue, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in times of radical and rapid changes in manufacturing, “we need to focus on deploying new technologies into factories and supply chains,” Hart says. “Technology is not all of the solution, but for the U.S. to expand our manufacturing base, we need to do it with technology as a key enabler, embracing companies of all sizes, including small and medium enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI becomes more capable, and automation becomes more flexible and more available, these are key building blocks upon which you can address manufacturing challenges,” he says. “AI and automation offer new accelerated ways to develop, deploy, and monitor production processes, which present a huge opportunity and, in some cases, a necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While manufacturing is always a combination of old technology, new technology, established practice, and new ways of thinking, digital technology gives manufacturers an opportunity to leapfrog competitors,” Hart says. “That’s very, very powerful for the U.S. and any company, or country, that aims to create differentiated capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in recent years, investors have increasingly bought into new manufacturing in the United States. “They see the opportunity to re-industrialize, to build the factories and production systems of the future,” Hart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That said, building new manufacturing is capital-intensive, and takes time,” he adds. “So that’s another area where it’s important to convene stakeholders and to think about how startups and growth-stage companies build their capital portfolios, how large industry can support an ecosystem of small businesses and young companies, and how to develop talent to support those growing companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these concerns and opportunities in the manufacturing ecosystem play to MIT’s strengths. “MIT’s DNA of cross-disciplinary collaboration and working with industry can let us create a lot of impact,” Hart emphasizes. “We can understand the practical challenges. We can also explore breakthrough ideas in research and cultivate successful outcomes, all the way to new companies and partnerships. Sometimes those are seen as disparate approaches, but we like to bring them together.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/john-hart-mit-00.png?itok=W2PumkXm\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">John Hart is head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and faculty co-director of the Initiative for New Manufacturing.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: David Sella</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitnano\">MIT.nano</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/education\">Education, teaching, academics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/industry\">Industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/manufacturing\">Manufacturing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/labor-jobs\">Labor and jobs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-and-policy\">Technology and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/political-science\">Political science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Eco-driving measures could significantly reduce vehicle emissions</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/eco-driving-measures-could-significantly-reduce-vehicle-emissions-0807</link>\n  <description>New research shows automatically controlling vehicle speeds to mitigate traffic at intersections can cut carbon emissions between 11 and 22 percent.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/eco-driving-measures-could-significantly-reduce-vehicle-emissions-0807</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Any motorist who has ever waited through multiple cycles for a traffic light to turn green knows how annoying signalized intersections can be. But sitting at intersections isn’t just a drag on drivers’ patience — unproductive vehicle idling could contribute as much as 15 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. land transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale modeling study led by MIT researchers reveals that eco-driving measures, which can involve dynamically adjusting vehicle speeds to reduce stopping and excessive acceleration, could significantly reduce those CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a powerful artificial intelligence method called deep reinforcement learning, the researchers conducted an in-depth impact assessment of the factors affecting vehicle emissions in three major U.S. cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis indicates that fully adopting eco-driving measures could cut annual city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11 to 22 percent, without slowing traffic throughput or affecting vehicle and traffic safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles on the road employ eco-driving, it would result in 25 to 50 percent of the total reduction in CO2 emissions, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, dynamically optimizing speed limits at about 20 percent of intersections provides 70 percent of the total emission benefits. This indicates that eco-driving measures could be implemented gradually while still having measurable, positive impacts on mitigating climate change and improving public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/inline/eco-driving.gif\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-uuid=\"49a19790-c04e-4465-ad70-9841001a6200\" data-entity-type=\"file\" alt=\"Two intersections with lots of cars; the 100% adoption has less traffic.\" width=\"521\" height=\"333\" data-caption=\"An animated GIF compares what 20% eco-driving adoption looks like to 100% eco-driving adoption.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Image: Courtesy of the researchers\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vehicle-based control strategies like eco-driving can move the needle on climate change reduction. We’ve shown here that modern machine-learning tools, like deep reinforcement learning, can accelerate the kinds of analysis that support sociotechnical decision making. This is just the tip of the iceberg,” says senior author Cathy Wu, the Class of 1954 Career Development Associate Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, and a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by lead author Vindula Jayawardana, an MIT graduate student; as well as MIT graduate students Ao Qu, Cameron Hickert, and Edgar Sanchez; MIT undergraduate Catherine Tang; Baptiste Freydt, a graduate student at ETH Zurich; and Mark Taylor and Blaine Leonard of the Utah Department of Transportation. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X25001500\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;research appears&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A multi-part modeling study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic control measures typically call to mind fixed infrastructure, like stop signs and traffic signals. But as vehicles become more technologically advanced, it presents an opportunity for eco-driving, which is a catch-all term for vehicle-based traffic control measures like the use of dynamic speeds to reduce energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, eco-driving could involve speed guidance in the form of vehicle dashboards or smartphone apps. In the longer term, eco-driving could involve intelligent speed commands that directly control the acceleration of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most prior work has focused on how&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to implement eco-driving. We shifted the frame to consider the question of should&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;we implement eco-driving. If we were to deploy this technology at scale, would it make a difference?” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, the researchers embarked on a multifaceted modeling study that would take the better part of four years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began by identifying 33 factors that influence vehicle emissions, including temperature, road grade, intersection topology, age of the vehicle, traffic demand, vehicle types, driver behavior, traffic signal timing, road geometry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges was making sure we were diligent and didn’t leave out any major factors,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they used data from OpenStreetMap, U.S. geological surveys, and other sources to create digital replicas of more than 6,000 signalized intersections in three cities — Atlanta, San Francisco, and Los Angeles — and simulated more than a million traffic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used deep reinforcement learning to optimize each scenario for eco-driving to achieve the maximum emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning optimizes the vehicles’ driving behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a high-fidelity traffic simulator, rewarding vehicle behaviors that are more energy-efficient while penalizing those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cast the problem as a decentralized cooperative multi-agent control problem, where the vehicles cooperate to achieve overall energy efficiency, even among non-participating vehicles, and they act in a decentralized manner, avoiding the need for costly communication between vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, training vehicle behaviors that generalize across diverse intersection traffic scenarios was a major challenge. The researchers observed that some scenarios are more similar to one another than others, such as scenarios with the same number of lanes or the same number of traffic signal phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the researchers trained separate reinforcement learning models for different clusters of traffic scenarios, yielding better emission benefits overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with the help of AI, analyzing citywide traffic at the network level would be so computationally intensive it could take another decade to unravel, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they broke the problem down and solved each eco-driving scenario at the individual intersection level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carefully constrained the impact of eco-driving control at each intersection on neighboring intersections. In this way, we dramatically simplified the problem, which enabled us to perform this analysis at scale, without introducing unknown network effects,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant emissions benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they analyzed the results, the researchers found that full adoption of eco-driving could result in intersection emissions reductions of between 11 and 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits differ depending on the layout of a city’s streets. A denser city like San Francisco has less room to implement eco-driving between intersections, offering a possible explanation for reduced emission savings, while Atlanta could see greater benefits given its higher speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles employ eco-driving, a city could still realize 25 to 50 percent of the total emissions benefit because of car-following dynamics: Non-eco-driving vehicles would follow controlled eco-driving vehicles as they optimize speed to pass smoothly through intersections, reducing their carbon emissions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, eco-driving could also increase vehicle throughput by minimizing emissions. However, Wu cautions that increasing throughput could result in more drivers taking to the roads, reducing emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while their analysis of widely used safety metrics known as surrogate safety measures, such as time to collision, suggest that eco-driving is as safe as human driving, it could cause unexpected behavior in human drivers. More research is needed to fully understand potential safety impacts, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results also show that eco-driving could provide even greater benefits when combined with alternative transportation decarbonization solutions. For instance, 20 percent eco-driving adoption in San Francisco would cut emission levels by 7 percent, but when combined with the projected adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, it would cut emissions by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a first attempt to systematically quantify network-wide environmental benefits of eco-driving. This is a great research effort that will serve as a key reference for others to build on in the assessment of eco-driving systems,” says Hesham Rakha, the Samuel L. Pritchard Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech, who was not involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the researchers focus on carbon emissions, the benefits are highly correlated with improvements in fuel consumption, energy use, and air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is almost a free intervention. We already have smartphones in our cars, and we are rapidly adopting cars with more advanced automation features. For something to scale quickly in practice, it must be relatively simple to implement and shovel-ready. Eco-driving fits that bill,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by Amazon and the Utah Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-EcoDriving-01-press.jpg?itok=qAjylkrY\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Implementing co-driving techniques can significantly reduce intersection carbon dioxide emissions without impacting traffic throughput or safety, according to new MIT research.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/transportation\">Transportation</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cities\">Cities</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/autonomous-vehicles\">Autonomous vehicles</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/civil-engineering\">Civil and environmental engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>School of Architecture and Planning welcomes new faculty for 2025</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/school-architecture-planning-welcomes-new-faculty-0806</link>\n  <description>Four new professors join the Department of Architecture and MIT Media Lab.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:10:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/school-architecture-planning-welcomes-new-faculty-0806</guid>\n        <dc:creator>School of Architecture and Planning</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four new faculty members join the School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P) this fall, offering the MIT community creativity, knowledge, and scholarship in multidisciplinary roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These individuals add considerable strength and depth to our faculty,” says Hashim Sarkis, dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. “We are excited for the academic vigor they bring to research and teaching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/karrie-karahalios-announce/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karrie G.

That’s because traditional data storage systems were designed to handle simple commands from a handful of users at once, whereas today, AI systems with millions of agents need to continuously access and process large amounts of data in parallel. Traditional data storage systems now have layers of complexity, which slows AI systems down because data must pass through multiple tiers before reaching the graphical processing units (GPUs) that are the brain cells of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian, co-founded by Michael Tso ’93, SM ’93 and Hiroshi Ohta, is helping storage keep up with the AI revolution. The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models. The system reduces complexity by applying parallel computing to data storage, consolidating AI functions and data onto a single parallel-processing platform that stores, retrieves, and processes scalable datasets, with direct, high-speed transfers between storage and GPUs and CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s integrated storage-computing platform simplifies the process of building commercial-scale AI tools and gives businesses a storage foundation that can keep up with the rise of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things people miss about AI is that it’s all about the data,” Tso says. “You can’t get a 10 percent improvement in AI performance with 10 percent more data or even 10 times more data — you need 1,000 times more data. Being able to store that data in a way that’s easy to manage, and in such a way that you can embed computations into it so you can run operations while the data is coming in without moving the data — that’s where this industry is going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From MIT to industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at MIT in the 1990s, Tso was introduced by Professor William Dally to parallel computing — a type of computation in which many calculations occur simultaneously. Tso also worked on parallel computing with Associate Professor Greg Papadopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an incredible time because most schools had one super-computing project going on — MIT had four,” Tso recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Tso worked with MIT senior research scientist David Clark, a computing pioneer who contributed to the internet’s early architecture, particularly the transmission control protocol (TCP) that delivers data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a graduate student at MIT, I worked on disconnected and intermittent networking operations for large scale distributed systems,” Tso says. “It’s funny — 30 years on, that’s what I’m still doing today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his graduation, Tso worked at Intel’s Architecture Lab, where he invented data synchronization algorithms used by Blackberry. He also created specifications for Nokia that ignited the ringtone download industry. He then joined Inktomi, a startup co-founded by Eric Brewer SM ’92, PhD ’94 that pioneered search and web content distribution technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Tso started Gemini Mobile Technologies with Joseph Norton ’93, SM ’93 and others. The company went on to build the world’s largest mobile messaging systems to handle the massive data growth from camera phones. Then, in the late 2000s, cloud computing became a powerful way for businesses to rent virtual servers as they grew their operations. Tso noticed the amount of data being collected was growing far faster than the speed of networking, so he decided to pivot the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data is being created in a lot of different places, and that data has its own gravity: It’s going to cost you money and time to move it,” Tso explains. “That means the end state is a distributed cloud that reaches out to edge devices and servers. You have to bring the cloud to the data, not the data to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tso officially launched Cloudian out of Gemini Mobile Technologies in 2012, with a new emphasis on helping customers with scalable, distributed, cloud-compatible data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t see when we first started the company was that AI was going to be the ultimate use case for data on the edge,” Tso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Tso’s research at MIT began more than two decades ago, he sees strong connections between what he worked on and the industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like my whole life is playing back because David Clark and I were dealing with disconnected and intermittently connected networks, which are part of every edge use case today, and Professor Dally was working on very fast, scalable interconnects,” Tso says, noting that Dally is now the senior vice president and chief scientist at the leading AI company NVIDIA. “Now, when you look at the modern NVIDIA chip architecture and the way they do interchip communication, it’s got Dally’s work all over it. With Professor Papadopoulos, I worked on accelerate application software with parallel computing hardware without having to rewrite the applications, and that’s exactly the problem we are trying to solve with NVIDIA. Coincidentally, all the stuff I was doing at MIT is playing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Cloudian’s platform uses an object storage architecture in which all kinds of data —documents, videos, sensor data — are stored as a unique object with metadata. Object storage can manage massive datasets in a flat file stucture, making it ideal for unstructured data and AI systems, but it traditionally hasn’t been able to send data directly to AI models without the data first being copied into a computer’s memory system, creating latency and energy bottlenecks for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Cloudian announced that it has extended its object storage system with a vector database that stores data in a form which is immediately usable by AI models. As the data are ingested, Cloudian is computing in real-time the vector form of that data to power AI tools like recommender engines, search, and AI assistants. Cloudian also announced a partnership with NVIDIA that allows its storage system to work directly with the AI company’s GPUs. Cloudian says the new system enables even faster AI operations and reduces computing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA contacted us about a year and a half ago because GPUs are useful only with data that keeps them busy,” Tso says. “Now that people are realizing it’s easier to move the AI to the data than it is to move huge datasets. Our storage systems embed a lot of AI functions, so we’re able to pre- and post-process data for AI near where we collect and store the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-first storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian is helping about 1,000 companies around the world get more value out of their data, including large manufacturers, financial service providers, health care organizations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s storage platform is helping one large automaker, for instance, use AI to determine when each of its manufacturing robots need to be serviced. Cloudian is also working with the National Library of Medicine to store research articles and patents, and the National Cancer Database to store DNA sequences of tumors — rich datasets that AI models could process to help research develop new treatments or gain new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GPUs have been an incredible enabler,” Tso says. “Moore’s Law doubles the amount of compute every two years, but GPUs are able to parallelize operations on chips, so you can network GPUs together and shatter Moore’s Law. That scale is pushing AI to new levels of intelligence, but the only way to make GPUs work hard is to feed them data at the same speed that they compute — and the only way to do that is to get rid of all the layers between them and your data.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Cloudian-01.jpg?itok=j9Gg2rpo\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/alumni\">Alumni/ae</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT tool visualizes and edits “physically impossible” objects</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-meschers-tool-visualizes-edits-physically-impossible-objects-0804</link>\n  <description>By visualizing Escher-like optical illusions in 2.5 dimensions, the “Meschers” tool could help scientists understand physics-defying shapes and spark new designs.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:40:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-meschers-tool-visualizes-edits-physically-impossible-objects-0804</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Alex Shipps | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-00f766d6-7fff-403a-378d-5aaf2f5b25af\"&gt;M.C. Escher’s artwork is a gateway into a world of depth-defying optical illusions, featuring “impossible objects” that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries. What you perceive his illustrations to be depends on your point of view — for example, a person seemingly walking upstairs may be heading down the steps if you tilt your head&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.54256.html\"&gt;sideways&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Computer graphics scientists and designers can recreate these illusions in 3D, but only by bending or cutting a real shape and positioning it at a particular angle. This workaround has downsides, though: Changing the smoothness or lighting of the structure will expose that it isn’t actually an optical illusion, which also means you can’t accurately solve geometry problems on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a unique approach to represent “impossible” objects in a more versatile way. Their “&lt;a href=\"https://anadodik.github.io/publication/meschers/\"&gt;Meschers&lt;/a&gt;” tool converts images and 3D models into 2.5-dimensional structures, creating Escher-like depictions of things like windows, buildings, and even donuts. The approach helps users relight, smooth out, and study unique geometries while preserving their optical illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tool could assist geometry researchers with calculating the distance between two points on a curved impossible surface (“geodesics”) and simulating how heat dissipates over it (“heat diffusion”). It could also help artists and computer graphics scientists create physics-breaking designs in multiple dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lead author and MIT PhD student Ana Dodik aims to design computer graphics tools that aren’t limited to replicating reality, enabling artists to express their intent independently of whether a shape can be realized in the physical world. “Using Meschers, we’ve unlocked a new class of shapes for artists to work with on the computer,” she says. “They could also help perception scientists understand the point at which an object truly becomes impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Dodik and her colleagues will present their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://anadodik.github.io/publication/meschers/Meschers.pdf\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; at the SIGGRAPH conference in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making impossible objects possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Impossible objects can’t be fully replicated in 3D. Their constituent parts often look plausible, but these parts don’t glue together properly when assembled in 3D. But what can be computationally imitated, as the CSAIL researchers found out, is the process of how we perceive these shapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/impossible-triangle\"&gt;Penrose Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. The object as a whole is physically impossible because the depths don’t “add up,” but we can recognize real-world 3D shapes (like its three L-shaped corners) within it. These smaller regions can be realized in 3D — a property called “local consistency” — but when we try to assemble them together, they don’t form a globally consistent shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Meschers approach models’ locally consistent regions without forcing them to be globally consistent, piecing together an Escher-esque structure. Behind the scenes, Meschers represents impossible objects as if we know their x and y coordinates in the image, as well as differences in z coordinates (depth) between neighboring pixels; the tool uses these differences in depth to reason about impossible objects indirectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many uses of Meschers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to rendering impossible objects, Meschers can subdivide their structures into smaller shapes for more precise geometry calculations and smoothing operations. This process enabled the researchers to reduce visual imperfections of impossible shapes, such as a red heart outline they thinned out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also tested their tool on an “impossibagel,” where a bagel is shaded in a physically impossible way. Meschers helped Dodik and her colleagues simulate heat diffusion and calculate geodesic distances between different points of the model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Imagine you’re an ant traversing this bagel, and you want to know how long it’ll take you to get across, for example,” says Dodik. “In the same way, our tool could help mathematicians analyze the underlying geometry of impossible shapes up close, much like how we study real-world ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Much like a magician, the tool can create optical illusions out of otherwise practical objects, making it easier for computer graphics artists to create impossible objects. It can also use “inverse rendering” tools to convert drawings and images of impossible objects into high-dimensional designs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Meschers demonstrates how computer graphics tools don’t have to be constrained by the rules of physical reality,” says senior author Justin Solomon, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and leader of the CSAIL Geometric Data Processing Group. “Incredibly, artists using Meschers can reason about shapes that we will never find in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Meschers can also aid computer graphics artists with tweaking the shading of their creations, while still preserving an optical illusion. This versatility would allow creatives to change the lighting of their art to depict a wider variety of scenes (like a sunrise or sunset) — as Meschers demonstrated by relighting a model of a dog on a skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Despite its versatility, Meschers is just the start for Dodik and her colleagues. The team is considering designing an interface to make the tool easier to use while building more elaborate scenes. They’re also working with perception scientists to see how the computer graphics tool can be used more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dodik and Solomon wrote the paper with CSAIL affiliates Isabella Yu ’24, SM ’25; PhD student Kartik Chandra SM ’23; MIT professors Jonathan Ragan-Kelley and Joshua Tenenbaum; and MIT Assistant Professor Vincent Sitzmann.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their work was supported, in part, by the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Mathworks Fellowship, the Hertz Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Schmidt Sciences AI2050 fellowship, MIT Quest for Intelligence, the U.S. Army Research Office, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, SystemsThatLearn@CSAIL initiative, Google, the MIT–IBM Watson AI Laboratory, from the Toyota–CSAIL Joint Research Center, Adobe Systems, the Singapore Defence Science and Technology Agency, and the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/mit-csail-Meschers.jpg?itok=mwr0SOLG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“Meschers” can create multi-dimensional versions of objects that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries, such as buildings you might see in an M.C.

In computer science parlance, the molecule is “symmetric,” meaning the fundamental structure of that molecule remains the same if it undergoes certain transformations, like rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a drug discovery model doesn’t understand symmetry, it could make inaccurate predictions about molecular properties. But despite some empirical successes, it’s been unclear whether there is a computationally efficient method to train a good model that is guaranteed to respect symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new study by MIT researchers answers this question, and shows the first method for machine learning with symmetry that is provably efficient in terms of both the amount of computation and data needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results clarify a foundational question, and they could aid researchers in the development of more powerful machine-learning models that are designed to handle symmetry. Such models would be useful in a variety of applications, from discovering new materials to identifying astronomical anomalies to unraveling complex climate patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These symmetries are important because they are some sort of information that nature is telling us about the data, and we should take it into account in our machine-learning models. We’ve now shown that it is possible to do machine-learning with symmetric data in an efficient way,” says Behrooz Tahmasebi, an MIT graduate student and co-lead author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19758\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by co-lead author and MIT graduate student Ashkan Soleymani; Stefanie Jegelka, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) and a member of the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and senior author Patrick Jaillet, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symmetric data appear in many domains, especially the natural sciences and physics. A model that recognizes symmetries is able to identify an object, like a car, no matter where that object is placed in an image, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless a machine-learning model is designed to handle symmetry, it could be less accurate and prone to failure when faced with new symmetric data in real-world situations. On the flip side, models that take advantage of symmetry could be faster and require fewer data for training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But training a model to process symmetric data is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common approach is called data augmentation, where researchers transform each symmetric data point into multiple data points to help the model generalize better to new data. For instance, one could rotate a molecular structure many times to produce new training data, but if researchers want the model to be guaranteed to respect symmetry, this can be computationally prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach is to encode symmetry into the model’s architecture. A well-known example of this is a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently handles symmetric data because of how it is designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Graph neural networks are fast and efficient, and they take care of symmetry quite well, but nobody really knows what these models are learning or why they work. Understanding GNNs is a main motivation of our work, so we started with a theoretical evaluation of what happens when data are symmetric,” Tahmasebi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explored the statistical-computational tradeoff in machine learning with symmetric data. This tradeoff means methods that require fewer data can be more computationally expensive, so researchers need to find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this theoretical evaluation, the researchers designed an efficient algorithm for machine learning with symmetric data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical combinations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they borrowed ideas from algebra to shrink and simplify the problem. Then, they reformulated the problem using ideas from geometry that effectively capture symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they combined the algebra and the geometry into an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently, resulting in their new algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the theory and applications were focusing on either algebra or geometry. Here we just combined them,” Tahmasebi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm requires fewer data samples for training than classical approaches, which would improve a model’s accuracy and ability to adapt to new applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By proving that scientists can develop efficient algorithms for machine learning with symmetry, and demonstrating how it can be done, these results could lead to the development of new neural network architectures that could be more accurate and less resource-intensive than current models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists could also use this analysis as a starting point to examine the inner workings of GNNs, and how their operations differ from the algorithm the MIT researchers developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we know that better, we can design more interpretable, more robust, and more efficient neural network architectures,” adds Soleymani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the National Research Foundation of Singapore, DSO National Laboratories of Singapore, the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Learning-Symmetric-01.jpg?itok=jTPWN5G8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study by MIT researchers shows the first method for machine learning with symmetry that is provably efficient in terms of both the amount of computation and data needed.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock, MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nsf\">National Science Foundation (NSF)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>“FUTURE PHASES” showcases new frontiers in music technology and interactive performance</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/future-phases-showcase-new-frontiers-music-technology-interactive-performance-0729</link>\n  <description>Groundbreaking MIT concert, featuring electronic and computer-generated music, was a part of the 2025 International Computer Music Conference.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/future-phases-showcase-new-frontiers-music-technology-interactive-performance-0729</guid>\n        <dc:creator>MIT Music and Theater Arts</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Music technology took center stage at MIT during “FUTURE PHASES,” an evening of works for string orchestra and electronics, presented by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://musictech.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program&lt;/a&gt; as part of the 2025 International Computer Music Conference (ICMC).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event was held last month in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall within the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building. Produced in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future Group and Boston’s self-conducted chamber orchestra A Far Cry, “FUTURE PHASES” was the first event to be presented by the MIT Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program in MIT Music’s new space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“FUTURE PHASES” offerings included two new works by MIT composers: the world premiere of&amp;nbsp;“EV6,” by MIT Music’s Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor Evan Ziporyn and professor of the practice Eran Egozy; and the U.S. premiere of&amp;nbsp;“FLOW Symphony,” by the MIT Media Lab’s Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media Tod Machover. Three additional works were selected by a jury from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://icmc2025.sites.northeastern.edu/special-call-for-scores-mit/\"&gt;an open call&lt;/a&gt; for works:&amp;nbsp;“The Wind Will Carry Us Away,” by Ali Balighi; “A Blank Page,” by Celeste Betancur&amp;nbsp;Gutiérrez and Luna Valentin; and “Coastal Portrait: Cycles and Thresholds,”&amp;nbsp;by Peter Lane. Each work was performed by&amp;nbsp;Boston’s own&amp;nbsp;multi-Grammy-nominated string orchestra, A Far Cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ICMC is all about presenting the latest research, compositions, and performances in electronic music,” says Egozy,&amp;nbsp;director of the new Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program at MIT. When approached to be a part of this year’s conference, “it seemed the perfect opportunity to showcase MIT’s commitment&amp;nbsp;to music technology, and in particular the exciting new areas being developed right now: a new master’s program in music technology and computation, the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building with its enhanced music technology facilities, and new faculty arriving at MIT with joint appointments between &lt;a href=\"https://mta.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts&lt;/a&gt; (MTA) and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).” These recently hired professors include Anna Huang, a keynote speaker for the conference and creator of the machine learning model&amp;nbsp;Coconet that powered Google’s first AI Doodle, the &lt;a href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet\"&gt;Bach Doodle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy emphasizes the uniqueness of this occasion: “You have to understand that this is a very special situation. Having a full 18-member string orchestra [A Far Cry] perform new works that include electronics does not happen very often. In most cases, ICMC performances consist either entirely of electronics and computer-generated music, or perhaps a small ensemble of two-to-four musicians. So the opportunity we could present to the larger community of music technology was particularly exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this exciting opportunity, an open call was put out internationally to select the other pieces that would accompany Ziporyn and Egozy’s “EV6” and Machover’s “FLOW Symphony.” Three pieces were selected from a total of 46 entries to be a part of the evening’s program by a panel of judges that included Egozy, Machover, and other distinguished composers and technologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We received a huge variety of works from this call,” says Egozy. “We saw all kinds of musical styles and ways that electronics would be used. No two pieces were very similar to each other, and I think because of that, our audience got a sense of how varied and interesting a concert can be for this format. A Far Cry was really the unifying presence. They played all pieces with great passion and nuance. They have a way of really drawing audiences into the music. And, of course, with the Thomas Tull Concert Hall being in the round, the audience felt even more connected to the music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy continues, “we took advantage of the technology built into the Thomas Tull Concert Hall, which has 24 built-in speakers for surround sound allowing us to broadcast unique, amplified sound to every seat in the house. Chances are that every person might have experienced the sound slightly differently, but there was always some sense of a multidimensional evolution of sound and music as the pieces unfolded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five works of the evening employed a range of technological components that included playing synthesized, prerecorded, or electronically manipulated sounds; attaching microphones to instruments for use in real-time signal processing algorithms; broadcasting custom-generated musical notation to&amp;nbsp;the musicians; utilizing generative AI to process live sound and play it back in interesting and unpredictable ways; and audience participation, where spectators use their cellphones as musical instruments to become a part of the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziporyn and Egozy’s piece, “EV6&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; took particular advantage of this last innovation: “Evan and I had previously collaborated on a system called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://musictech.mit.edu/tutti/\"&gt;Tutti&lt;/a&gt;, which means ‘together’ in Italian. Tutti gives an audience the ability to use their smartphones as musical instruments so that we can all play together.” Egozy developed the technology, which was first used in the MIT Campaign for a Better World in 2017. The original application involved a three-minute piece for cellphones only. “But for this concert,” Egozy explains, “Evan had the idea that we could use the same technology to write a new piece — this time, for audience phones and a live string orchestra as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the piece’s title, Ziporyn says, “I drive an EV6; it’s my first electric car, and when I first got it, it felt like I was driving an iPhone. But of course it’s still just a car: it’s got wheels and an engine, and it gets me from one place to another. It seemed like a good metaphor for this piece, in which a lot of the sound is literally played on cellphones, but still has to work like any other piece of music. It’s also a bit of an homage to David Bowie’s song ‘TVC 15,’ which is about falling in love with a robot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy adds, “We wanted audience members to feel what it is like to play together in an orchestra. Through this technology, each audience member becomes a part of an orchestral section (winds, brass, strings, etc.). As they play together, they can hear their whole section playing similar music while also hearing other sections in different parts of the hall play different music. This allows an audience to feel a responsibility to their section, hear how music can move between different sections of an orchestra, and experience the thrill of live performance. In ‘EV6,’ this experience was even more electrifying because everyone in the audience got to play with a live string orchestra — perhaps for the first time in recorded history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the concert, guests were treated to six music technology demonstrations that showcased the research of undergraduate and graduate students from both the MIT Music program and the MIT Media Lab. These included a gamified interface for harnessing just intonation systems (Antonis Christou); insights from a human-AI co-created concert (Lancelot Blanchard and Perry Naseck); a system for analyzing piano playing data across campus (Ayyub Abdulrezak ’24, MEng ’25); capturing music features from audio using latent frequency-masked autoencoders (Mason Wang); a device that turns any surface into a drum machine (Matthew Caren ’25); and a play-along interface for learning traditional Senegalese rhythms (Mariano Salcedo ’25). This last example led to the creation of Senegroove, a drumming-based application specifically designed for an upcoming edX online course taught by ethnomusicologist and MIT associate professor in music Patricia Tang, and world-renowned Senegalese drummer and MIT lecturer in music Lamine Touré, who provided performance videos of the foundational rhythms used in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Egozy muses, “'FUTURE PHASES' showed how having the right space — in this case, the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building — really can be a driving force for new ways of thinking, new projects, and new ways of collaborating. My hope is that everyone in the MIT community, the Boston area, and beyond soon discovers what a truly amazing place and space we have built, and are still building here, for music and music technology at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-MTA-6-13-25-335_0.jpg?itok=X_GvlV7G\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A Far Cry performs “EV6” as part of the “FUTURE PHASES” concert at MIT.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Jonathan Sachs</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/performances\">Performances</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music2\">Music</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/arts\">Arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music\">Music technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electronics\">Electronics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/media-lab-0\">Media Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music-and-theater-arts\">Music and theater arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Pedestrians now walk faster and linger less, researchers find</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/pedestrians-now-walk-faster-and-linger-less-researchers-find-0724</link>\n  <description>A computer vision study compares changes in pedestrian behavior since 1980, providing information for urban designers about creating public spaces.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:45:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/pedestrians-now-walk-faster-and-linger-less-researchers-find-0724</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;City life is often described as “fast-paced.” A new study suggests that’s more true than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-authored by MIT scholars, shows that the average walking speed of pedestrians in three northeastern U.S. cities increased 15 percent from 1980 to 2010. The number of people lingering in public spaces declined by 14 percent in that time as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used machine-learning tools to assess 1980s-era video footage captured by renowned urbanist William Whyte, in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They compared the old material with newer videos from the same locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something has changed over the past 40 years,” says MIT professor of the practice Carlo Ratti, a co-author of the new study. “How fast we walk, how people meet in public space — what we’re seeing here is that public spaces are working in somewhat different ways, more as a thoroughfare and less a space of encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424662122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Exploring the social life of urban spaces through AI&lt;/a&gt;,” is published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. The co-authors are Arianna Salazar-Miranda MCP ’16, PhD ’23, an assistant professor at Yale University’s School of the Environment; Zhuanguan Fan of the University of Hong Kong; Michael Baick; Keith N. Hampton, a professor at Michigan State University; Fabio Duarte, associate director of the Senseable City Lab; Becky P.Y. Loo of the University of Hong Kong; Edward Glaeser,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics at Harvard University; and Ratti, who is also director of MIT’s Senseable City Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results could help inform urban planning, as designers seek to create new public areas or modify existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public space is such an important element of civic life, and today partly because it counteracts the polarization of digital space,” says Salazar-Miranda. “The more we can keep improving public space, the more we can make our cities suited for convening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet you at the Met&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte was a prominent social thinker whose famous 1956 book, “The Organization Man,” probing the apparent culture of corporate conformity in the U.S., became a touchstone of its decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Whyte spent the latter decades of his career focused on urbanism. The footage he filmed, from 1978 through 1980, was archived by a Brooklyn-based nonprofit organization called the Project for Public Spaces and later digitized by Hampton and his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte chose to make his recording at four spots in the three cities combined: Boston’s Downtown Crossing area; New York City’s Bryant Park; the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a famous gathering point and people-watching spot; and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a group led by Hampton then shot new footage at those locations, at the same times of day Whyte had, to compare and contrast current-day dynamics with those of Whyte’s time. To conduct the study, the co-authors used computer vision and AI models to summarize and quantify the activity in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have found that some things have not changed greatly. The percentage of people walking alone barely moved, from 67 percent in 1980 to 68 percent in 2010. On the other hand, the percentage of individuals entering these public spaces who became part of a group declined a bit. In 1980, 5.5 percent of the people approaching these spots met up with a group; in 2010, that was down to 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there’s a more transactional nature to public space today,” Ratti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer outdoor groups: Anomie or Starbucks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people’s behavioral patterns have altered since 1980, it’s natural to ask why. Certainly some of the visible changes seem consistent with the pervasive use of cellphones; people organize their social lives by phone now, and perhaps zip around more quickly from place to place as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the footage from William Whyte, the people in public spaces were looking at each other more,” Ratti says. “It was a place you could start a conversation or run into a friend. You couldn’t do things online then. Today, behavior is more predicated on texting first, to meet in public space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scholars note, if groups of people hang out together slightly less often in public spaces, there could be still another reason for that: Starbucks and its competitors. As the paper states, outdoor group socializing may be less common due to “the proliferation of coffee shops and other indoor venues. Instead of lingering on sidewalks, people may have moved their social interactions into air-conditioned, more comfortable private spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly coffeeshops were far less common in big cities in 1980, and the big chain coffeeshops did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, public-space behavior might have been evolving all this time regardless of Starbucks and the like. The researchers say the new study offers a proof-of-concept for its method and has encouraged them to conduct additional work. Ratti, Duarte, and other researchers from MIT’s Senseable City Lab have turned their attention to an extensive survey of European public spaces in an attempt to shed more light on the interaction between people and the public forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are collecting footage from 40 squares in Europe,” Duarte says. “The question is: How can we learn at a larger scale? This is in part what we’re doing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Urban-Walking-01.jpg?itok=YTbccwQn\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study finds that people walk faster and linger less in urban settings.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/urban-studies\">Urban studies and planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cities\">Cities</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-vision\">Computer vision</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/social-media\">Social media</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New machine-learning application to help researchers predict chemical properties</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/chemxploreml-app-helps-predict-chemical-properties-0724</link>\n  <description>ChemXploreML makes advanced chemical predictions easier and faster — without requiring deep programming skills.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/chemxploreml-app-helps-predict-chemical-properties-0724</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Danielle Randall Doughty | Department of Chemistry</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One of the shared, fundamental goals of most chemistry researchers is the need to predict a molecule’s properties, such as its boiling or melting point. Once researchers can pinpoint that prediction, they’re able to move forward with their work yielding discoveries that lead to medicines, materials, and more. Historically, however, the traditional methods of unveiling these predictions are associated with a significant cost — expending time and wear and tear on equipment, in addition to funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enter a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (ML). ML has lessened the burden of molecule property prediction to a degree, but the advanced tools that most effectively expedite the process — by learning from existing data to make rapid predictions for new molecules — require the user to have a significant level of programming expertise. This creates an accessibility barrier for many chemists, who may not have the significant computational proficiency required to navigate the prediction pipeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To alleviate this challenge, researchers in the &lt;a href=\"https://mcguirelab.mit.edu/\"&gt;McGuire Research Group&lt;/a&gt; at MIT have created &lt;a href=\"https://aravindhnivas.github.io/ChemXploreML-docs/\"&gt;ChemXploreML&lt;/a&gt;, a user-friendly desktop app that helps chemists make these critical predictions without requiring advanced programming skills. Freely available, easy to download, and functional on mainstream platforms, this app is also built to operate entirely offline, which helps keep research data proprietary. The exciting new technology is outlined in an &lt;a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00516\"&gt;article published recently in&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One specific hurdle in chemical machine learning is translating molecular structures into a numerical language that computers can understand. ChemXploreML automates this complex process with powerful, built-in \"molecular embedders\" that transform chemical structures into informative numerical vectors. Next, the software implements state-of-the-art algorithms to identify patterns and accurately predict molecular properties like boiling and melting points, all through an intuitive, interactive graphical interface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"The goal of ChemXploreML is to democratize the use of machine learning in the chemical sciences,” says&amp;nbsp;Aravindh Nivas Marimuthu, a postdoc in the McGuire Group and lead author of the article. “By creating an intuitive, powerful, and offline-capable desktop application, we are putting state-of-the-art predictive modeling directly into the hands of chemists, regardless of their programming background. This work not only accelerates the search for new drugs and materials by making the screening process faster and cheaper, but its flexible design also opens doors for future innovations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;ChemXploreML is designed to to evolve over time, so as future techniques and algorithms are developed, they can be seamlessly integrated into the app, ensuring that researchers are always able to access and implement the most up-to-date methods. The application was tested on five key molecular properties of organic compounds — melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, critical temperature, and critical pressure — and achieved high accuracy scores of up to 93 percent for the critical temperature. The researchers also demonstrated that a new, more compact method of representing molecules (VICGAE) was nearly as accurate as standard methods, such as Mol2Vec, but was up to 10 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“We envision a future where any researcher can easily customize and apply machine learning to solve unique challenges, from developing sustainable materials to exploring the complex chemistry of interstellar space,” says Marimuthu.

The United States, for instance, has indefinitely stalled its only long-term underground nuclear waste repository. Scientists are using both modeling and experimental methods to study the effects of underground nuclear waste disposal and ultimately, they hope, build public trust in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from scientists at MIT, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the University of Orléans makes progress in that direction. The study shows that simulations of underground nuclear waste interactions, generated by new, high-performance-computing software, aligned well with experimental results from a research facility in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was co-authored by MIT PhD student Dauren Sarsenbayev and Assistant Professor Haruko Wainwright, along with&amp;nbsp;Christophe Tournassat and&amp;nbsp;Carl Steefel, &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2511885122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These powerful new computational tools, coupled with real-world experiments like those at the Mont Terri research site in Switzerland, help us understand how radionuclides will migrate in coupled underground systems,” says Sarsenbayev, who is first author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope the research will improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research — coupling both computation and experiments — is important to improve our confidence in waste disposal safety assessments,” says Wainwright. “With nuclear energy re-emerging as a key source for tackling climate change and ensuring energy security, it is critical to validate disposal pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing simulations with experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disposing of nuclear waste in deep underground geological formations is currently considered the safest long-term solution for managing high-level radioactive waste. As such, much effort has been put into studying the migration behaviors of radionuclides from nuclear waste within various natural and engineered geological materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1996, the Mont Terri research site in northern Switzerland has served as an important test bed for an international consortium of researchers interested in studying materials like Opalinus clay — a thick, water-tight claystone abundant in the tunneled areas of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is widely regarded as one of the most valuable real-world experiment sites because it provides us with decades of datasets around the interactions of cement and clay, and those are the key materials proposed to be used by countries across the world for engineered barrier systems and geological repositories for nuclear waste,” explains Sarsenbayev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, Sarsenbayev and Wainwright collaborated with co-authors Tournassat and Steefel, who have developed high-performance computing software to improve modeling of interactions between the nuclear waste and both engineered and natural materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, several challenges have limited scientists’ understanding of how nuclear waste reacts with cement-clay barriers. For one thing, the barriers are made up of irregularly mixed materials deep underground. Additionally, the existing class of models commonly used to simulate radionuclide interactions with cement-clay do not take into account electrostatic effects associated with the negatively charged clay minerals in the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tournassat and Steefel’s new software accounts for electrostatic effects, making it the only one that can simulate those interactions in three-dimensional space. The software, called CrunchODiTi, was developed from established software known as CrunchFlow and was most recently updated this year. It is designed to be run on many high-performance computers at once in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers looked at a 13-year-old experiment, with an initial focus on cement-clay rock interactions. Within the last several years, a mix of both negatively and positively charged ions were added to the borehole located near the center of the cement emplaced in the formation. The researchers focused on a 1-centimeter-thick zone between the radionuclides and cement-clay referred to as the “skin.” They compared their experimental results to the software simulation, finding the two datasets aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results are quite significant because previously, these models wouldn’t fit field data very well,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s interesting how fine-scale phenomena at the ‘skin’ between cement and clay, the physical and chemical properties of which changes over time, could be used to reconcile the experimental and simulation data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental results showed the model successfully accounted for electrostatic effects associated with the clay-rich formation and the interaction between materials in Mont Terri over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is all driven by decades of work to understand what happens at these interfaces,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s been hypothesized that there is mineral precipitation and porosity clogging at this interface, and our results strongly suggest that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This application requires millions of degrees of freedom because these multibarrier systems require high resolution and a lot of computational power,” Sarsenbayev says. “This software is really ideal for the Mont Terri experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing waste disposal plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model could now replace older models that have been used to conduct safety and performance assessments of underground geological repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. eventually decides to dispose nuclear waste in a geological repository, then these models could dictate the most appropriate materials to use,” Sarsenbayev says. “For instance, right now clay is considered an appropriate storage material, but salt formations are another potential medium that could be used. These models allow us to see the fate of radionuclides over millennia. We can use them to understand interactions at timespans that vary from months to years to many millions of years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarsenbayev says the model is reasonably accessible to other researchers and that future efforts may focus on the use of machine learning to develop less computationally expensive surrogate models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data from the experiment will be available later this month. The team plans to compare those data to additional simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our collaborators will basically get this block of cement and clay, and they’ll be able to run experiments to determine the exact thickness of the skin along with all of the minerals and processes present at this interface,”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sarsenbayev says. “It’s a huge project and it takes time, but we wanted to share initial data and this software as soon as we could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers hope their study leads to a long-term solution for storing nuclear waste that policymakers and the public can support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interdisciplinary study that includes real world experiments showing we’re able to predict radionuclides’ fate in the subsurface,” Sarsenbayev says. “The motto of MIT’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering is ‘Science. Systems. Society.’ I think this merges all three domains.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-Waste-Storage-01.jpg?itok=lR_HzoIX\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study, co-authored by MIT researchers, aims to improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-power-and-reactors\">Nuclear power and reactors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-security-and-policy\">Nuclear security and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n"
