Somewhere in between is the Anker Laptop Power Bank, which has a 25,000 mAh capacity and is <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Multi-Device-Charging-Retractable/dp/B0DCBB2YTR\">currently on sale for $89.99</a>, a 33 percent discount from its list price.</p><p>So, what do you get for your $90 outlay? Well, a lot actually. The Laptop Power Bank can accept up to 100 watts of input when recharging and supply 100 watts of output to supported devices. If your laptop can accept 100W, the Laptop Power Bank will happily hum along at that rate until it’s depleted. If you recharge the Laptop Power Bank with a 100-watt charger, you’ll replenish 30 percent of its capacity in just 22 minutes.</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"f03b475d-92bb-4cb1-b24c-9952c3d2e55f\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"The Anker Laptop Power Bank can supply up to 165 watts when two USB-C ports are in use.

One of the USB-C cords can extend to 2.3 feet and can retract into the housing when not in use. A second USB-C cable also serves as a carrying strap. If that isn’t enough, the unit features a regular USB-C port and a USB-A port on the side for charging your other peripherals.</p><p>The two integrated USB-C cables and the USB-C port can charge a single device at up to 100 watts. The USB-A port supports a maximum of 33 watts. If you use two USB-C ports at once, you can output a maximum of 165 watts between them, or 133 watts if you’re using one USB-C port and the USB-A port. If you max out the Laptop Power Bank by using all four ports simultaneously, you’re limited to 130 watts maximum output.</p><p>Another feature worth noting is that the device has a built-in LCD that can display device temperature, output/input wattage, and current battery health (and cycle count). And because the total battery capacity is 90 WHr, it is TSA-approved for carrying on an airplane, which is nice to know for long-haul flights.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/ankers-25-000-mah-laptop-power-bank-is-usd89-for-prime-day-this-discounted-portable-charger-includes-two-integrated-usb-c-cables-and-165w-max-output</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ At $89.99, the Anker Laptop Power Bank is TSA-approved and ready to power all of your portable devices ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">JG29dzbGA6ayLsAnaQuMoh</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FyvMDFzLCZzRTAQTVL68nC-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 23:12:34 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Peripherals]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ brandon.hill@futurenet.com (Brandon Hill) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Brandon Hill ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FyvMDFzLCZzRTAQTVL68nC-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Anker]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[The Anker Laptop Power Bank 25K ]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[The Anker Laptop Power Bank 25K ]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FyvMDFzLCZzRTAQTVL68nC-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ 3D Printer Sales Bonanza during Prime Day 2025 — these are the best deals we found at all five sales ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Amazon's Prime Big Deals Day event is in full swing, and I took this opportunity to take a closer look at some of the great 3D printer deals while there is still time to grab one of the best 3D printers and a few rolls of filament to keep you printing.</p><p>Currently, there are numerous great deals on mainstream FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printers that utilize common filaments such as PLA and PETG.

It produces clean, detailed prints at very high speed. Best of all, it is exceptionally easy to use, lowering the entry barrier so that anyone can start 3D printing.</p><p>The direct drive extruder makes short work of many types of filament, including even the most challenging ones, such as TPU.

Rather than move the print bed around (bed slinger), the print head moves around the X and Y axes. As each layer is printed, the print bed moves down (Z axis), creating the print. This gives the Prusa One incredible stability, and that produces great quality prints at high speed. Every first layer is perfect!</p><p>The build volume is 250 x 210 x 270 mm, and the enclosed design means that you can print big and with exotic filaments that are prone to warping during open-air printing. You can print in PLA, PETG, TPU, ABS, ASA, and Polycarbonate.</p><p>Send your prints over Wi-Fi via PrusaSlicer, and rest assured that they will come out great.

     <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There are exactly two things every PC has in common: it needs power and it needs to be cooled. Modern-day desktops mostly scale linearly in cost, with higher-end builds typically opting for liquid cooling over conventional air cooling. As such, today, we've rounded up some of the best AIOs we could find as part of Amazon's Prime Big Day Deals, along with a nice little cameo of tradition at the end. All of these coolers represent great value, and you can't go wrong with any of them.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=CPU+cooler&crid=2SCB8EOUTDR7X&sprefix=cpu+co%2Caps%2C368\" target=\"_blank\">Check out CPU cooler deals on Amazon</a></li></ul><p>First up, we have the Cooler Master MasterLiquid 240 Core II, a 240mm AIO liquid cooler that comes with two 120mm RGB fans and a similarly RGB-illuminated pump block featuring an infinity mirror design. The supplied MF120 Lite fans can spin between 650 and 1,750 RPM, are designed to remain quiet during operation, and feature daisy-chaining for easy installation.</p><p>Speaking of, the 240 Core II supports all the major Intel and AMD sockets currently available, and includes tube clips to efficiently route the 400mm flexible tuning around board components, such as your RAM. Cooler Master usually sells this for $85, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">but the MasterLiquid 240 Core II is available for just $54 on Amazon</a> right now.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"4bc04008-5581-4d94-9974-8d731d86ffba\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"With its gorgeous infinity mirror design, daisy-linked RGB fans, solid performance, and quiet operation, this AIO becomes a no-brainer at just over $50.

The <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Thermalright-ARGB-Specification-Resolution-Performance/dp/B0DJX1XPGV?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Thermalright Grand Vision 360 ARGB is available for just $83.48</a>, offering a massive discount from its regular price of $124. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/liquid-cooling/thermalright-grand-vision-360-review\" target=\"_blank\">In our testing</a>, it aced pretty much every benchmark and set a new standard for value proposition. We still recommend it as a top option in our <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-aio-coolers\" target=\"_blank\">list of the best CPU coolers</a>.</p><p>This is a 360mm AIO that comes with 3x TL-H12-X28-S fans, rated for 2,150 RPM while producing under 30 decibels of noise. You get 80.45 CFM of airflow, along with S-FDVB2 bearings that \"greatly improve the performance.\" Arguably, though, the main draw here is the 3.4-inch, 480x480 square IPS display, which can display a wide range of animations and telemetry data. The screen is also magnetically attached to the pump block, so you can easily install or remove it at will.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"05196f43-c047-44c8-895e-62d87897c764\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"One of the best AIO coolers money can buy, and now it's even cheaper than ever before.

It's got \"EZ Connect\" functionality, allowing you to daisy-chain the fans together and only plug in two cables (instead of six). It comes with an \"Offset Kit\" as well, which allows you to adjust the positioning of the cold plate for better contact. This cooler comes with a 3,400 RPM high-efficiency pump that offers \"whisper-quiet\" operation, allowing the RGB fans and pump block to do all the screaming instead.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"c6508e77-ac24-468c-bc09-f1236804bc3a\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"Backed by a 3-year warranty and featuring numerous creature comforts, MSI's CoreLiquid A15 360 is the ideal choice for those seeking to enhance their setup without compromising on cooling quality.\" data-dimension48=\"Backed by a 3-year warranty and featuring numerous creature comforts, MSI's CoreLiquid A15 360 is the ideal choice for those seeking to enhance their setup without compromising on cooling quality.\" data-dimension25=\"$89.99\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MAG-CORELIQUID-A15-360/dp/B0DPY1CVK4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \"  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%;\"><img id=\"ZLAdCf5DtMStzoThuMja2n\" name=\"LD0006205590\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZLAdCf5DtMStzoThuMja2n.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1600\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" credit=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Backed by a 3-year warranty and featuring numerous creature comforts, MSI's CoreLiquid A15 360 is the ideal choice for those seeking to enhance their setup without compromising on cooling quality.<a class=\"view-deal button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MAG-CORELIQUID-A15-360/dp/B0DPY1CVK4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-dimension112=\"c6508e77-ac24-468c-bc09-f1236804bc3a\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"Backed by a 3-year warranty and featuring numerous creature comforts, MSI's CoreLiquid A15 360 is the ideal choice for those seeking to enhance their setup without compromising on cooling quality.\" data-dimension48=\"Backed by a 3-year warranty and featuring numerous creature comforts, MSI's CoreLiquid A15 360 is the ideal choice for those seeking to enhance their setup without compromising on cooling quality.\" data-dimension25=\"$89.99\">View Deal</a></p></div><p>We also have a reliable and safe choice in the Corsair Nautilus 360 RS ARGB, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-Nautilus-ARGB-Liquid-Cooler/dp/B0DF7C4YPQ?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">which can be purchased</a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-Nautilus-ARGB-Liquid-Cooler/dp/B0DF7C4YPQ?th=1\" target=\"_blank\"> for just $105</a>, offering a 20% discount.

It uses the newer 12V-2x6 power connector, but compatibility with older power supplies is not a concern, thanks to Zotac including a convenient 2 x 8-pin-to-16-pin cable for easy backward compatibility.</p><p>The graphics card comes with three DisplayPort 2.1b outputs with UHBR20 support. They support resolutions and refresh rates of up to 4K (3840 x 2160) at 480 Hz or 8K (7680 x 4320) at 165 Hz with DSC. There's also an HDMI 2.1b port for 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 60Hz, both with HDR support. The configuration allows for connecting up to four displays simultaneously.</p><p>The GeForce RTX 5070 is a fantastic graphics card for 1080p (1920 x 1080) and 1440p (2560 x 1440) gaming. It also performs well at 4K, provided you're willing to make slight adjustments to the image quality.

You spun up a few cloud instances and paid your AWS bill. If you needed more, you just scaled up your usage. That model still exists, but with the generative AI boom, it’s breaking down.</p><p>Supply shortages and hardware hoarding, alongside capital excess, have given rise to a strange model where AI companies are financing GPUs in the same way airlines finance planes — via multi-billion dollar debt, leaseback schemes, and vendor equity.</p><p>The latest in a growing list of examples is xAI, Elon Musk’s not-so-quiet rival to OpenAI, which is reportedly <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-backs-20-billion-xai-chip-deal\">raising $20 billion to fund GPU purchases</a>. According to reporting by <em>Bloomberg, </em>citing unnamed insiders, around $12 billion of that will be debt routed through a special-purpose vehicle, which buys chips from Nvidia and leases them back to xAI. Nvidia itself is fronting $2 billion in equity, a sign that Nvidia believes that xAI’s scale will pay off. The chips are destined for the Colossus 2 buildout, xAI’s South Memphis megasite, which Musk wants to expand to 200,000 GPUs.</p><p>This isn’t a one-off for Nvidia. The company also struck a much larger deal with OpenAI last month, investing as much as <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-and-openai-forge-usd100-billion-alliance-to-deliver-10-gigawatts-of-nvidia-hardware-for-ai-datacenters\">$100 billion across multiple years</a> in a structure that effectively pre-funds a 10 GW GPU roadmap. That deal isn’t based on debt or cloud credit, though; it’s prepaid infrastructure in exchange for non-voting equity, tied to future product delivery. That money flows from Nvidia to OpenAI, then back to Nvidia through hardware purchases.</p><h2 id=\"silicon-backed-debt-2\">Silicon-backed debt</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"ZKF8RzvzwTi5U2yW395MGA\" name=\"tsmc-wafer-fab-semiconductor-hero-1.jpg\" alt=\"TSMC\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZKF8RzvzwTi5U2yW395MGA.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: TSMC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>CoreWeave <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/coreweave-deal-with-openai-now-worth-usd22-4-billion-another-usd6-4-billion-of-ai-data-center-capacity-added\">raised $2.3 billion in debt last year</a>, backed by Nvidia H100s, treating its inventory like collateral. Lambda followed with a $1.5 billion leaseback deal, renting its own servers to Nvidia, which became its largest customer. These are early examples of what’s becoming a new norm of start-ups financing GPUs first and building business models second. After all, you don’t have to prove revenue when your assets appreciate with every generation.</p><p>This all points to the changing role of the GPU itself as a balance-sheet asset that’s tradable, leasable, and sometimes, more valuable than the company holding it. That transformation is driven in part by persistent shortages. With Nvidia’s chips in limited supply and overwhelming demand from every corner of the AI market, simply having physical access to GPUs creates a whole lot of leverage. But, arguably, the more influential factor is Nvidia’s lock on the AI training market. When demand exceeds supply, ownership becomes leverage, and Nvidia is structuring deals to keep it that way.</p><h2 id=\"amd-s-openai-deal-looks-cautious-by-comparison-2\">AMD’s OpenAI deal looks cautious by comparison</h2><p>AMD <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/openai-signs-6gw-amd-gpu-deal\">recently announced its own blockbuster deal with OpenAI</a>, comprising six gigawatts of Instinct MI450 capacity, tied to performance milestones and a public stock price target. It’s structured as a warrant: If OpenAI buys the full amount and AMD’s stock hits $600, it can acquire up to 160 million shares at one cent each — almost 10% of the company.</p><p>Unlike Nvidia’s cash-for-hardware deals, AMD’s doesn’t fund GPU purchases but rather, rewards them. There’s no equity transfer until the first gigawatt is deployed, and the full stake only vests if OpenAI executes at scale. That makes it more of a performance incentive than a financing mechanism whereby OpenAI gets upside while AMD gets validation. But the chips still need to be built and delivered.</p><p>That alone makes the deal more conservative in comparison to those made by Nvidia, and potentially more sustainable. Nvidia’s arrangements offer immediate compute but raise questions about circular financing: Are customers buying chips because they need them, or because the vendor is helping them foot the bill? AMD doesn’t have that luxury and has to sell on merit alone.</p><h2 id=\"a-circular-capital-bubble-2\">A circular capital bubble?</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2000px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:54.85%;\"><img id=\"Nyq3BFBbFRVVv7yrpGybpM\" name=\"jensen.PNG\" alt=\"Jensen Huang\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nyq3BFBbFRVVv7yrpGybpM.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1097\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nvidia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless, OpenAI’s deal shouldn’t be dismissed as a hedge against Nvidia. Sources familiar with the company’s roadmap say AMD’s current-gen MI300X has already been qualified for inference workloads. It has a bigger memory pool than the H100 and performs well under LLM loads. The MI450 series, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-enterprise-roadmap-rubin-rubin-ultra-feynman-and-silicon-photonics\">expected next year</a>, will ramp alongside Nvidia’s Blackwell-based GB200 systems. But while Nvidia remains allocation-bound, AMD has capacity.</p><p>It’s also the first time that OpenAI has made a long-term commitment to non-Nvidia silicon (aside from rumors about it <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/open-ai-building-its-own-chip-still-dependent-on-nvidia\">building its own chips with Broadcom</a>), giving AMD a major foothold that comes with a chance to scale software and win mindshare in an ecosystem still dominated by CUDA. It also provides OpenAI with compute flexibility; if the market tightens further, having two suppliers could mean everything. But <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-intel-rtx-socs-could-be-an-existential-threat-to-amd-apus\">AMD is still playing catch-up</a> because it doesn’t have the volume, customer base, or vendor leverage that Nvidia enjoys. Its ROCm software stack might be improving, but CUDA is well ahead, and the financing gap — who pays upfront, who delivers when — still favors Nvidia.</p><p>Ultimately, there’s a growing sense that the AI hardware market and, indeed, the AI space in general, is running hot. Enthusiasts, analysts, and regulators alike are all asking whether demand is real or, rather, reflective of a feedback loop where GPU orders inflate valuations, which fund more orders, which inflate valuations again. The Bank of England has warned of a dot-com-era risk of a “sharp market correction” in AI-linked equities, reports <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/fe474cff-564c-41d2-aaf7-313636a83e5b\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Financial Times.</em></a></p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openais-significant-investments-raise-more-questions-than-answers-ceo-sam-altman-remains-tight-lipped-about-how-the-company-will-deliver\">OpenAI’s recent valuation puts it near $500 billion</a>, most of which is based on theoretical and future compute. It’s wrong to say that all this is Nvidia’s doing, but the company is undoubtedly at the center of it. When the supplier becomes the investor, the lender, and the customer, the boundaries between growth and leverage begin to break. Right now, everyone’s a winner, but if AI workloads don’t scale fast enough to absorb all that compute, the consequences could be dire.</p><p>AMD’s slower, more disciplined approach might pale in comparison to what Nvidia is doing, but it also carries fewer risks. Its OpenAI deal doesn’t put equity on the table until performance is proven. And if demand cools or customers retrench, AMD won’t be left holding the bag. Nvidia’s strategy might have made it the most valuable chipmaker in history, but it’s also made it a quasi-financial institution, allocating capital as much as silicon.

This makes its surprisingly low $89 discount even more impressive, considering the Freezer III Pro is half the price of most premium AIO liquid coolers, such as those from Asus or MSI. It might not be as pretty as those coolers (including the RGB variant), but it sure will outperform them all in raw cooling power.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more savings, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech\"><em>Best PC Hardware deals</em></a><em> for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds\"><em>SSD and Storage Deals,</em></a><em> </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals\"><em>Hard Drive Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals\"><em>Gaming Monitor Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-graphics-card-deals-now\"><em>Graphics Card Deals</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals\"><em>CPU Deals</em></a><em> pages.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/get-usd35-off-arctics-liquid-freezer-iii-360mm-cpu-cooler-this-prime-day-the-best-cpu-cooler-money-can-buy-is-just-usd89</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Our favorite 360mm AIO liquid cooler, the Liquid Freezer III Pro, is on a 28% discount for Prime Day, dropping its price down to just $89.99.

We've compiled all these deals here and are constantly updating this page with the best GPU deals available. We also have a<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/lowest-gpu-prices\"> GPU price index</a> that lists the lowest price we can find today on any specific class of GPUs.</p><p>Deals on gaming GPUs can be challenging to find, as top-end GPUs often sell above MSRP. However, this means that even GPUs listed at MSRP are a deal compared to other options. And, believe it or not, there are plenty of <em>actual</em> deals to be found on cards that sell below MSRP, too, particularly in the budget price bands.</p><p>We select deals based on our in-depth knowledge, gained from thorough reviews, expansive benchmarks, and extensive historical price analysis. We're seeing a lot better value on AMD and Intel cards than on Nvidia-powered offerings, but you can still find some savings on RTX cards.

As you move up the stack of cards, you can play at 2K resolution and higher settings or, with the priciest cards, 4K.</p><p>🔎 <strong>How many fps do you consider smooth? </strong>Most people consider 30 fps the bare minimum for playability and 60 fps decent. However, if you want less lag for eSports gaming, you'll want to be able to go to over 100 fps at reasonable settings. See our <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gpu-hierarchy,4388.html\">GPU benchmark hierarchy</a> to find out how each GPU fares.</p><p>🔎 <strong>Do you have enough power?</strong> Make sure that you have enough capacity from your power supply to support the card. If you're not sure, use a tool such as <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.newegg.com/tools/power-supply-calculator/\">Newegg's power supply calculator</a> to see how much you need. If your power supply can't handle the card, either get a new PSU or a different card.</p><p>🔎 <strong>Will it fit in your case?</strong> If you've got a small PC case, make sure you check the length of the card against the case's clearance numbers.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech\">Best deals on tech & PC hardware</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals\">Best monitor deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-gaming-pc-deals\">Best PC and laptop deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds\">Best SSD deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals\">Best CPU deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals\">Best Hard Drive HDD Deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/best-pc-case-deals\">Best PC Cases Deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dell-alienware-deals\">Best Dell and Alienware deals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-3d-printer-deals\">Best 3D printer deals </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/best-pc-peripherals-deals-keyboards-headsets-mice\">Best PC peripherals deals</a></li></ul><p>For more potential savings, check our lists of the best <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/coupons/newegg.com\">Newegg promo codes</a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/coupons/bestbuy.com\">Best Buy coupon codes</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/best-gaming-graphics-card-gpu-deals-now-2025</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Save money on Radeon, RTX, and Arc graphics cards. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">debMbYCourT3DaXynPsTaG</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEuMmN9DpAZZXNu9VAaSAT-1280-80.png\" type=\"image/png\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:49:29 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[GPUs]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Stewart Bendle ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEuMmN9DpAZZXNu9VAaSAT-1280-80.png\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tom&#039;s Hardware]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Best Amazon Prime Day gaming graphics card deals]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Best Amazon Prime Day gaming graphics card deals]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEuMmN9DpAZZXNu9VAaSAT-1280-80.png\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ We built a Prime Day PC for less than $850, and we didn't even have to use an 8GB GPU ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you're in the market for a budget gaming rig and don't want to shop around for parts this Amazon Prime Day, then we've put together an epic budget build using parts on sale at Amazon (and rivals) during the Big Deal Days event.</p><p>Market conditions mean we couldn't quite squeeze out an $800 rig without significant compromises, such as skimping on the RAM or just stuffing all the parts into a ziplock bag rather than a real case.

You'll get an 8-core processor, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB M.2 SSD, and the plucky RX 9060 XT with 16GB of VRAM.</p><p>As is often the case, Amazon isn't always the best place to buy parts during its own sales events, so you'll find Newegg and even B&H Photo have come in clutch to get us under budget.

With the launch of its latest DiskStation Manager 7.3, users can once again use 3.5-inch hard drives and 2.5-inch SATA SSDs from brands like Western Digital and Seagate, without losing out on crucial features.</p><p>Earlier this year, the company had restricted core functionality for third-party and non-certified drives, including support for storage pools, health monitoring, deduplication, and firmware updates. The company made Synology-branded and Synology-certified drives compulsory, claiming that users of the Plus series NAS models would benefit from higher performance, increased reliability, and more efficient support. <br><br>In a way, the company forced users to rely solely on Synology-branded disks to unlock full capabilities. This reportedly resulted in community backlash, which eventually allowed rival brands to take advantage and promote their own hardware as more open and flexible alternatives.</p><p>For context, Synology does not manufacture its own hard drives. Instead, the company uses rebranded drives from popular vendors such as Seagate, Toshiba, or Western Digital, and applies a custom firmware. This firmware effectively acts as a form of digital rights management (DRM), which ensures that only these specific drives can access the NAS system’s full range of features and performance options.</p><p>With the latest update, Synology has restored some crucial features and aligned newer NAS models, including the DiskStation DS925+ and DiskStation DS1525,+ closer to how its NAS systems worked before introducing the policy. The company is also said to be working with major drive manufacturers to broaden the range of officially certified storage options.</p><p>Notably, the change does not apply to M.2 storage drives, meaning that creating storage pools still requires drives from the official Hardware Compatibility List.</p><p>Apart from restoring third-party drive support, Synology’s DiskStation Manager 7.3 introduces important upgrades focusing on performance, security, and flexibility. According to the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.synology.com/en-global/releaseNote/DSM\">official release notes</a>, users will get access to intelligent data tiering for better storage efficiency, new security indicators for improved threat detection, support for native exFAT for external devices, email moderation for MailPlus, and enhanced collaboration tools like shared labels and advanced file locking in Synology Drive. The update also adds AI integration through the Synology AI Console with data masking and filtering.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

According to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-07/musk-s-xai-nears-20-billion-capital-raise-tied-to-nvidia-chips\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the funds are being split between $7-$8 billion in new equity and as much as $12 billion in debt, routed through a special-purpose vehicle that will purchase Nvidia GPUs and lease them out to xAI. Nvidia itself is believed to be investing up to $2 billion into the equity portion, according to <em>Bloomberg </em>sources.</p><p>The arrangement effectively finances purchases of Nvidia’s own hardware, while ensuring that xAI secures priority access to GPUs during a period of tightening supply. It also gives Nvidia a foothold in one of the most aggressive AI training deployments in the United States. The chips are earmarked for Colossus 2, xAI’s 100 MW Memphis site, which came online earlier this year. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/xai-colossus-supercomputer-with-100k-h100-gpus-comes-online-musk-lays-out-plans-to-double-gpu-count-to-200k-with-50k-h100-and-50k-h200\">Musk has plans to double the site’s GPU count to 200,000. </a></p><p>In September, Musk publicly denied rumors that claimed xAI was raising $10 billion at a $200 billion valuation, taking to X to say, “Fake news. xAI is not raising any capital right now.” The deal now described by <em>Bloomberg </em>is larger, more complex, and more tightly bound to Nvidia. <em>Reuters </em>confirmed that the chips would be used at xAI’s Memphis site, while others believe this to be a continuation of the AI industry's circular financing.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1006px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"fF8MnnBPSqmN8xEHeggAqU\" name=\"huang-musk-fff.jpg\" alt=\"Happy times for OpenAI\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fF8MnnBPSqmN8xEHeggAqU.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1006\" height=\"566\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Elon Musk on X / Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for the chips, these may arrive before permanent grid infrastructure is in place. xAI is known to have <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/xai-pushes-power-strategy-towards-1gw-ai-factory\">turned to large-scale turbine deployments</a> to meet power needs, drawing scrutiny from regulators and environmental groups, with many claiming that the company has installed and operated methane gas turbines without full permission — a claim the company has not disputed.</p><p>According to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), a vocal critic of the project, states that <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.selc.org/press-release/musks-xai-explores-another-massive-methane-gas-turbine-installation-at-second-south-memphis-data-center/\" target=\"_blank\">a second Memphis site</a> is under evaluation, with dozens more turbines planned. This second buildout could host between 40 and 90 methane gas turbines, generating up to 1.5 GW of electricity, which is far more than Colossus 2 is expected to consume in its initial phase. Documents reviewed by the SELC suggest both sites are part of a broader strategy to sidestep grid constraints by producing power on-site, regardless of environmental or permitting concerns.</p><p>If the financing closes at the size <em>Bloomberg</em> describes, xAI will have secured not just the GPUs needed to train at scale, but also the autonomy to run them on its own terms.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Not only can these monitors be quite expensive, but they can also occupy a substantial amount of desktop space. However, for those who have the need (and the space), there are options such as the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 (G93SC) and the MSI MPG 491CQP.

                                                                                            <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Dell has nearly doubled its <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://investors.delltechnologies.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dell-technologies-increases-its-long-term-financial-framework\" target=\"_blank\"><u>long-term growth outlook</u></a> on the back of surging demand for AI servers, raising revenue and earnings projections through its fiscal 2030 as it leans into the data center build-out.</p><p>Following an analyst meeting on October 7, the company said it now expects annual revenue growth of 7-9%, up from a prior range of 3-4%. Adjusted earnings per share are forecast to grow at least 15% annually over the same period, nearly twice the company's earlier estimate of 8%. Dell's stock rose more than 5% in morning trading following the update.</p><p>The jump reflects a sustained ramp in infrastructure sales tied to generative AI workloads. Dell said it has already shipped billions of dollars worth of AI servers and expects that figure to reach a $20 billion run-rate by 2026. Clients include major cloud service providers and specialized AI infrastructure firms such as CoreWeave and Elon Musk’s xAI, both of which are rapidly <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/xai-pushes-power-strategy-towards-1gw-ai-factory\"><u>scaling up their high-performance server deployments</u></a>.</p><p>The Infrastructure Solutions Group, which handles server, storage, and networking products, is now expected to grow 11-14% annually, compared to a prior range of 6-8%, arguably one of the clearest signs so far that Dell’s role in the hardware supply chain is only going to grow, at least as long as training and inference demand continues to outpace supply.</p><p>While the company builds and sells complete systems, its ability to source high-end Nvidia accelerators remains a gating factor, particularly for its AI-optimized PowerEdge line. Ultimately, the biggest bottleneck isn’t Dell’s manufacturing footprint, but <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/nvidia-books-entire-server-plant-capacity-through-2026-pushing-out-other-potential-customers-to-build-blackwell-and-rubin-ai-servers\"><u>access to GPU volume</u></a> in a supply chain still dominated by hyperscalers.</p><p>The client PC business remains a part of the company’s long-term plan, but the new forecasts suggest that AI infrastructure is now the company’s main focus. The PC market has yet to fully recover from its post-pandemic hangover, but Dell has pointed to a refresh cycle driven in part by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/windows-10-support-is-ending-but-end-of-10-wants-you-to-switch-to-linux\"><u>Windows 10’s end-of-support</u></a> date on October 14 — one week from now — as one reason for optimism. Even so, the company only projects a compound annual growth rate of 1% for its client PCs, and it thinks the best opportunity for continued growth is in commercial systems, not the broader consumer market.</p><p>Dell also reiterated its guidance for the current quarter and full year, and committed to raising its dividend by at least 10% annually through fiscal 2030. Still, some financial analysts have flagged margin risk as AI server competition intensifies. Higher build costs and component prices could squeeze profitability, even as top-line growth accelerates. For Dell, the concern will be not selling hardware but whether it can protect its earnings power in a market where hyperscalers are calling the shots.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

And despite owning at least a couple dozen keyboards, I'm still using the K8 HE as my daily driver, and to write this very deal post. It just looks and feels so nice, I don't want to switch back to anything else, despite missing a dedicated volume knob. To solve that, I've remapped the pgup and pgdn keys to control the volume, using the company's web interface, which I find more intuitive and a lot less clunky than most (OK, all) keyboard and peripheral software.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2951px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"YfdzkMNURtkhxwaCdEsqJH\" name=\"Keychron K8 HE Special Edition Fn row spacing\" alt=\"Keychron K8 HE Special Edition\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfdzkMNURtkhxwaCdEsqJH.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2951\" height=\"1660\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're after a gaming keyboard that doesn't look like it fell out of a spaceship, or just a productivity clacker that looks stunning and feels good to type on, I highly recommend Keychron's HE Special Edition lineup. They are even easier to recommend at their current sale prices. The only real downside is that while the switches are hot-swappable, the HE support means you can't swap in traditional mechanical switches if you want a different feel. But as linear switches go, these are among the nicest I've used over decades of keyboard reviewing.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"TMzDv4CnDYd8YrcjdYnZVD\" name=\"K2 HE - 13.jpg\" alt=\"Keychron K2 HE\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMzDv4CnDYd8YrcjdYnZVD.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Keychron)</span></figcaption></figure> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/mechanical-keyboards/the-prettiest-keyboard-ive-ever-used-is-up-to-20-percent-off-for-prime-day-and-its-magnetic-switches-are-great-for-gaming-keychron-he-gets-discounted-in-multiple-sizes</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Keychron's HE keyboards are pretty and packed with gaming features, like lubed magnetic switches.

Most of those are somewhat predictable, but occasionally an unexpected deal comes out of left field. Mobile chip giant Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/10/qualcomm-to-acquire-arduino-accelerating-developers--access-to-i\">is acquiring microcontroller expert Arduino</a> for an undisclosed sum. Along with its acquisition, Qualcomm also announced a new Arduino Uno Q board and Arduino App Lab IDE software.</p><p>The chipmaker claims that buying Arduino allows it to deliver \"a full-stack edge platform,\" or in other words, edge-device AI, with Arduino microcontrollers as the hardware piece of that puzzle. That would make a measure of sense, given Qualcomm's remarks that this acquisition should dovetail nicely with its acquisitions of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://edgeimpulse.com\" target=\"_blank\">Edge Impulse</a> IoT AI platform and IoT DevOps provider <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://foundries.io\" target=\"_blank\">Foundries.io</a>.</p><p>Since its founding in the mid-2000s, Arduino has grown to become the default option for anyone wanting an affordable microcontroller, thanks to the open-source design of the hardware and software. The devices spawned thousands of clones and an immense community that makes it exceedingly simple for newcomers to join in. The main distinction between an Arduino and a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/raspberry-pi\">Raspberry Pi</a> is the former is microcontroller based, the latter being a micro-computer. Though, Raspberry Pi has entered the microcontroller scene with its Raspberry Pi Pico, powered by its own RP2040 and RP2350 custom silicon.</p><p>The immediate question likely to be on most enthusiasts' minds, then, is what will happen to Arduino now that it's owned by one of the largest technology companies on the planet. For its part, Qualcomm states that Arduino will \"preserve its open approach and community spirit\" and \"retain its independent brand, tools, and mission\".</p><p>While that statement sounds good at face value, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/qualcomms-big-win-over-arm-could-reverberate-throughout-the-industry-ala-licensees-could-potentially-develop-custom-designs-without-renegotiating-terms\">Qualcomm's (in)famous legal team</a> might take umbrage with the amount of \"-duino\" clones out there. The Arduino ecosystem is a free-for-all (in a good way), and if Qualcomm adds any barriers to Arduino device usage, like forced product registrations or more restrictive licensing, that could put a significant chill on the project.</p><p>The devices themselves (and their clones) are ubiquitous and can be found most anywhere that sells electronic components and even big-box retailers. Any tightening of the supply chain or preferential resellers would also carry a negative impact.</p><p>Having said all that, there's no denying that having immediate and direct access to Qualcomm's technology and resources might prove a substantial benefit to Arduino. Chips and designs ought to be far easier to source, and Qualcomm's weight in purchasing components could result in even more affordable or better-performant Arduino devices.</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QxPBCBX8ac8\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>As for the new <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/product-uno-q\" target=\"_blank\">Arduino Uno Q</a>, it marries a Qualcomm DragonWing QRB2210 CPU that's capable of running Debian Linux with an STM32U585 microcontroller. This is the first Arduino product meant to work with the new Arduino App Lab, an IDE for Real-time OS, Linux, and Python — though it's apparently not yet available in the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#app-lab-section\" target=\"_blank\">Arduino downloads section</a>.</p><p>The price points, although likely justifiable, are encroaching on Raspberry Pi territory. The Uno Q comes in two variants: one with 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of eMMC storage, for $44 or 39€, that can be preordered today and will ship on October 25; the other with 4 GB of memory and 32 GB of storage for $59 or 53€. If you fancy the higher-end model, you should be able to order it in November, though the release date is currently set to \"end of year.\" Let's hope Qualcomm continues to invest in the Arduino ecosystem and maintains its open spirit.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

So, if you’re on the lookout for a great deal to expand your storage capacity, you can get the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YD3G568\">Western Digital 14TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive at just $169.99</a> — back at an all-time low compared to the normal $279.99, giving you a $110 discount. This is a 39% saving off the MSRP. WD offers desktop HDDs of varying sizes, from 4TB all the way to 26TB. But the discount on the 14TB variant is so good that it’s cheaper than both the 12TB and 10TB models right now, so you'd better act fast if you need it because we're in the closing hours of the event.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YD3G568\">Check out this Prime Day deal at Amazon</a></li></ul><p>Western Digital makes some of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-hard-drives\">best hard drives</a> on the market, so you won’t go wrong with the 14TB Elements Desktop eHDD. Although it’s not as fast as the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-external-hard-drive-ssd,5987.html\">best external SSDs</a> you can buy today, the massive 14TB capacity and low price mean you’re only paying around one cent for every gigabyte of space. It uses USB 3.2 Gen 1, which is just around 5 Gbps, but it should be good enough for automated backup operations when you’re not using your computer.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"6c93917d-eabd-4ce5-87ae-bf9fcbe0bda3\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"The Western Digital 14TB Elements Desktop External Hard Drive offers massive storage capacity at an affordable price.

The monitor originally had a suggested retail price of over $1,000, but this price has steadily decreased since its introduction three years ago. When we last visited the monitor just over a month ago in late August, it was selling for $549. However, for Amazon's Prime Big Deal Days, the price is even lower at just $521.99.</p><p>The AW3423DWF, which we rated 5 out of 5 stars, features a 34-inch Quantum Dot OLED (QD-OLED) panel with a 3440 x 1440 resolution and an 1800R curve. The refresh isn't as high as some of the newer panels on the market, but it's still quite respectable at 165 Hz, and is further enhanced by the low 0.1ms response time. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro is supported, and the monitor is also compatible with Nvidia G-Sync.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"a91c5adf-8ff0-4b27-bd85-9c665a9bf306\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"The Alienware AW3423DWF is available at Amazon for its lowest price to date, which is half its launch price.

This usually affects random read/write performance, but our review found that this drive's performance in real-world usage is top-notch regardless.</p><p>That's partly due to the use of Maxio's MAP1602 controller, paired with YMTC's 232-Layer TLC NAND, a combo which is usually only reserved for PCIe 5.0 drives. We get read speeds of up to 7,000 MB/s and write speeds of up to 6,200 MB/s, along with 6000TBW of endurance, which should be plenty to keep this bad boy running for years.</p><p>Speaking of, Lexar backs this drive up with a 5-year warranty. Moreover, there's no proprietary software supplied by Lexar so you're free (nay, encouraged) to use industry-standard tools like Clonezilla for backup, and CrystalDiskMark to gauge health info. The drive doesn't come with a heatsink because it doesn't need one — it stays under 70 °C in use— and, therefore, makes for a great option for laptops and the PlayStation 5. The standard M.2 2280 form factor means you can also fit this inside most handheld consoles.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"th99WjuLkseyjFKHCEfuhd\" name=\"ALLSSD-CDMSeqReadQD1.png\" alt=\"Lexar NM790 SSD\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/th99WjuLkseyjFKHCEfuhd.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"Z8xdmQnWnYYehPEurRTfde\" name=\"ALLSSD-PCM10Latency.png\" alt=\"Lexar NM790 SSD\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z8xdmQnWnYYehPEurRTfde.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"fhzvFbncc4Z9vjacRQQ5Lc\" name=\"ALLSSD-3DMLatency.png\" alt=\"Lexar NM790 SSD\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fhzvFbncc4Z9vjacRQQ5Lc.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"t8UbkSd7YVBHGnRM5Zv5ze\" name=\"ALLSSD-QuarchEfficiency.png\" alt=\"Lexar NM790 SSD\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t8UbkSd7YVBHGnRM5Zv5ze.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"gqXCJ6NxP7WhWwEJ23d6Ef\" name=\"ALLSSD-QuarchMaxPower.png\" alt=\"Lexar NM790 SSD\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gqXCJ6NxP7WhWwEJ23d6Ef.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Lexar's NM790 is an all-rounder that performs great across the board. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/lexar-nm790-ssd-review\" target=\"_blank\">In our testing of the 4TB model</a>, it regularly beat out similarly-spec'd and priced models, often coming out on top as the fastest DRAM-less Gen4 SSD.

During the Amazon Prime Big Deals Day sales events, you may be able to find one of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/microsd-cards/best-microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2\">best microSD Express cards for the Switch 2</a> for less.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of built-in storage, but if you want to add extra storage to your handheld console so that you can store more installed games, you're going to need to invest in the latest microSD Express storage technology, as the Nintendo Switch 2 is only compatible with microSD Express cards.</p><p>The latest microSD Express cards are faster at reading and writing data compared to non-Express microSD cards, which were used in the original Nintendo Switch. This is why they've been chosen as the must-have medium for the Switch 2.</p><p>Ensure you're purchasing the correct microSD card by verifying the symbol on the card. It must display the \"<em>EX\" </em>symbol, as shown in the picture below, to be compatible with the Switch 2.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:422px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:75.83%;\"><img id=\"gi9PDWqcoDtjctHsU9tuTb\" name=\"microSD Express logo\" alt=\"A picture of a microSD Express 256GB storage card with the Express symbol highlighted\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gi9PDWqcoDtjctHsU9tuTb.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"right\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"422\" height=\"320\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-right\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"pull-right inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Look for the Express symbol on microSD cards to make sure it's compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2 </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: SanDisk/Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support microSD Express cards with a capacity of up to 2TB, which should be more than enough to store a large number of games, should you want them all downloaded and preinstalled for on-the-go gaming. Only the Switch 2 will be able to fully utilize the increased performance of the microSD Express card. If you use the card in the original Switch, it will perform at the same level as a standard microSD card. So don't buy one thinking you can increase the performance of your original Switch console.</p><p>There will be licensed microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2, featuring a Nintendo logo, such as the Mario \"M,\" as were available for the original Switch. These microSD Express cards will be available for purchase directly from the Nintendo shop when they become available on June 5, 2025. Currently, prices are not listed for these licensed editions of Samsung's microSD Express 256GB cards. These cards should not have any performance advantage over standard models; it's just a branding decision. As such, one way to save a few bucks is to purchase a third-party, unlicensed microSD Express card from various other manufacturers and retailers.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-microsd-express-cards-for-switch-2-deals-quick-links\"><span>MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2 Deals: Quick Links</span></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=microsd+express+card&crid=2KW1QFJ9Z8YP4&sprefix=MicroSD+Expres+%2Caps%2C104&ref=nb_sb_ss_fb_1_15_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker\">All MicroSD Express cards at Amazon</a></li></ul><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-where-to-buy-microsd-express-cards-in-the-us-during-prime-day-2025\"><span>Where to buy microSD Express cards in the US during Prime Day 2025</span></h3><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"7effa130-f7e0-48bf-ad0c-75fd72e66c0d\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"This card is the fastest microSD Express card on the market.

<dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>While scouring Amazon for the best PC component deals during the Prime Big Deal Days can be fun, finding all the best deals, compatible parts, and doing all the legwork is a lot. So we've taken all the guesswork (and the hard work) out of building a PC, and put together a venerable 1440p gaming beast using parts that are only on sale during the Amazon event. Note that's \"during\", and not \"at\" the Prime event, because as is often the case, Amazon is being upstaged in a couple of markets by rivals like Newegg, where you'll be much better served buying GPUs and other components. We've cooked up a Radeon RX 9070 or RTX 5070-powered build that won't ruin you financially and should play most titles at 1440p.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/primeday\">Check out all the deals in Amazon's Prime Day Sale</a></li></ul><p>It's impossible to please everyone with a PC build, but hopefully this can help serve as a great guide if you're venturing out on your own PC building journey. We've picked the excellent Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, but you could, in theory, pick an Intel processor instead; just remember to change your motherboard and RAM accordingly. You can also dial up specs for more RAM, a beefier SSD, or an all-in-one liquid cooler if you wish, but this will drive the price up and over that magic $1,600 marker.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-1-600-prime-day-gaming-pc-quick-list\"><span>$1,600 Prime Day gaming PC: Quick list</span></h3><ul><li><strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTZB7F88\"><del>was $449</del> <strong>now $338</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong>Thermalright PS120SE CPU Air Cooler:</strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNH1W546\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"sponsored\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BNH1W546\"><strong>$35</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong>Asus TUF Gaming X870-PLUS:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-TUF-Gaming-X870-PLUS-Motherboard/dp/B0DGB8Q19Y/\"><del>was $299</del> <strong>now $229</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong>ASRock Challenger Radeon RX 9070 16GB:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/asrock-challenger-rx9070-cl-16g-radeon-rx-9070-16gb-graphics-card-triple-fans/p/N82E16814930138\"><del>was $699</del> <strong>now $549 at Newegg</strong></a></li><li><strong>MSI Ventus 3X OC RTX 5070 12GB:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/msi-rtx-5070-12g-ventus-3x-oc-geforce-rtx-5070-12gb-graphics-card-triple-fans/p/N82E16814137940\"><del>was $619</del> <strong>now $549</strong> <strong>at Newegg</strong></a></li><li><strong>Silicon Power DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) Zenith 6000MT/s (PC5-48000):</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLVCLYK4?th=1\"><strong>$105 at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung 990 Pro SSD 2TB:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-V9P2T0B-AM/dp/B0BHJJ9Y77/\"><del>was $199</del> <strong>now $133</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong>Corsair Frame 4000D:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-Frame-4000D-Modular-Mid-Tower/dp/B0DFHQ5HVL/?th=1\"><del>was $104</del> <strong>now $85</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><strong>Montech Century II 850W fully modular PSU:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MONTECH-Century-II-High-End-Cybenetics/dp/B0F3XW1J16/?th=1\"><del>was $89</del> <strong>now $85</strong> <strong>at Amazon</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id=\"1-600-prime-day-gaming-pc-2\">$1,600 Prime Day gaming PC</h2><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"3cc1b470-43a6-4d09-b3c1-a61139dec759\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"All-Time Low Price!This chip is among the fastest gaming CPUs on the market and drops into modern AM5 motherboards.

The most recent addition to intriguing yet unconventional hardware accessories introduces a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H2DX9J4\">~$21 graphics card mirror display (NB-VGA-MIRROR)</a> manufactured by Nagao Manufacturing Inc. The accessory is essentially a mirror that allows users to display their graphics card in full splendor.</p><p>As per <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.gdm.or.jp/pressrelease/2025/1007/606984\">Akihabara's report</a>, the graphics card mirror initially launched in September 2020; however, the Japanese accessory manufacturer is reintroducing it due to purported popular demand. Apparently, Japanese PC modders have been asking for its return, so the vendor is eager to please.</p><p>The stand is made from SPCC steel and has relatively compact dimensions, measuring 4.4 x 3.7 inches (113 x 93 mm). The vendor includes four rubber feet and four magnets, allowing the stand to adhere securely to your case, regardless of its material composition. Additionally, the stand features an adjustable mechanism that allows the angle to be set between 0 and 90 degrees.</p><p>Nagao Manufacturing Inc. produces the mirror from 2mm-thick acrylic material. Acrylic mirrors offer both advantages and disadvantages. While they are shatter-resistant, they are more susceptible to scratches than conventional glass mirrors. The mirror measures 11 x 4.3 inches (280 x 110 mm), allowing it to reflect even the largest graphics cards. It can simply be placed on the stand; however, for increased security, the vendor provides four pieces of double-sided tape to affix it to the stand.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery

For example, it is primarily designed for configurations where the graphics card is installed in a standard horizontal orientation. Although there is no apparent reason why it should not function with a vertically installed graphics card, some ingenuity may be required to adapt it accordingly. Due to its overall dimensions, the accessory will obstruct access to additional PCIe expansion slots on the motherboard. However, it is generally suitable for most users or gamers who run a single discrete graphics card.</p><p>Nagao Manufacturing Inc. offers the graphics card mirror for 3,280 yen, approximately equivalent to $21.70. The manufacturer anticipates that the accessory will soon be available on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H2DX9J4\">Amazon</a>, although it is currently up for purchase already at several Japanese retail outlets.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The display is equipped with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and is G-Sync compatible, helping you avoid tearing and stuttering during intense gameplay. As for connectivity, you get three video input ports (1x HDMI and 2x DP), so you don’t have to manually switch over your monitor if you have multiple gaming devices. It also comes with three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports plus one more Type-C port, allowing you to shorten the distance between your desktop and your peripherals.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Alienware AW2725DF is missing out on internal speakers or even a 3.5mm headphone jack — but these are things you can easily look over.

The highlight feature is the 3D-VCache which brings 96 MB of L3 cache placed right next to the compute die for the lowest latency possible.</p><p>In our testing, we found that the Ryzen 7 7800X3D outperforms Intel’s Core i9-14900K as well as the newer Arrow Lake based Core Ultra 9 285K in almost every gaming scenario. The CPU also boasts very strong 1% low frame rates, which means it keeps gameplay consistently smooth, even in demanding GPU-limited scenarios. Beyond sheer speed, it pulls this off without demanding extreme power or exotic components, making it one of the most power efficient gaming chips on the market today.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery

I figured, sure, I could clone the boot drive onto a more spacious drive so the OS and programs had more room to stretch their legs. <br><br>But then the thought of using multiple USB enclosures or shuffling drives in and out of my desktop filled me with dread as I pictured being there for hours getting everything done and the system back up and running. So I looked into getting an M.2 SSD cloner, and was surprised to see they can be found for as little as $49.</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"305cb0b0-d9b4-44b8-a735-1622b6e792e2\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"With support for NVMe M.2 SSDs and offline cloning, this device makes it simple to move your OS or files from one drive to another.

Operation is about as simple as it gets. You plug in the included USB-C power adapter, put your source drive in the left slot, the destination drive in the right slot, press the power button on the back, and a few logos light up, letting you know you're ready to go. Press the clone button on the top, and the cloning will commence (provided your destination is the same size or larger than your source).<br><br>That's assuming you want to do an offline clone. But because I wanted to also resize the partition between the old 110 GB and the newer Team Group 512 GB SSD, I used the second included USB-C cable to connect the Rosewill cloner to my laptop and powered up the device. Within seconds, both drives were recognized in Windows, so I fired up the excellent free <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.diskgenius.com/download.php\"><u>DiskGenius software</u></a>, cloned the old partition to the new Team Group drive with a few clicks, and then used the software to drag the boot partition to the full size of the new drive. The whole process took just a few minutes; the Rosewill cloner supports 20 Gbps USB, and I wasn't exactly copying a huge partition. <br><br>When the cloning process was finished, it was hard to believe it was all that easy. I had expected to be at my in-laws for hours, but I was done in less than 30 minutes. Sure, unless you're in IT, a drive cloner might not be something you use all the time, but it's handy to have around. You can also use it to save some money by buying a laptop with a cramped SSD and swapping in something much roomier – provided, of course, the laptop's storage isn't soldered to the motherboard. <br><br>The Rosewill cloner is also handy for just checking the contents of old M.2 drives you may have lying around. But if that's all you need, you can buy an NVMe enclosure or a single-drive dock.

your PC experience — whether it's a fan-favorite productivity mouse or a standalone gaming microphone that's been going strong for years. Amazon's Big Deals Day sales event is just two days long this time, from Oct. 7 to Oct. 8, but we've seen plenty of great deals on everything from clicky mechanical keyboards and ultra lightweight gaming mice to wireless headsets and 4K webcams.</p><p>We only pick the best deals: peripherals we've reviewed and tested, and that we continue to test over the years, tracking durability, comfort, and overall longevity. While the stakes might not seem as high on a gaming mouse or a headset as they are on GPU or <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-ssd-deals\">even an SSD</a>, but they're higher than you think — after all, peripherals are what you interact with most often, every single day. The right keyboard or mouse will probably have a much bigger impact on how you work (and play), at least as far as your immediate perception goes, than will swapping out any of your PC's internal components.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-best-amazon-prime-day-peripherals-deals-quick-links\"><span>Best Amazon Prime Day Peripherals Deals: Quick Links</span></h3><ul><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=PC+peripherals+sale\">All peripherals on sale, up to 50% off</a></li><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/LogitechG/page/0F4BFDF6-CD4A-4A8C-83A2-3104165D740C?\">Logitech G</a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/Razer/page/CDB96030-A7CF-4B56-B70C-67086A740274\">Razer</a><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/3180C3DC-B893-4BA9-9265-175B6D1E2643?\">SteelSeries</a></li><li><strong>HyperX: </strong><a href=\"https://hyperx.com/collections/sale\">Gaming Gear Sale</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?browsedCategory=pcmcat159700050051&id=pcat17071&qp=currentoffers_facet%3DCurrent+Deals%7EOn+Sale&st=categoryid%24pcmcat159700050051\">Gaming Accessories on Sale</a></li></ul><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-best-amazon-prime-day-peripherals-deal-overall\"><span>Best Amazon Prime Day Peripherals Deal Overall</span></h3><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"e6e0a800-00ce-4e5b-be48-4780a0534449\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"This lightweight gaming mouse from Logitech weighs only 80 grams and is one of the only modern FPS gaming mice to feature a truly ambidextrous design, with the ability to switch the side buttons for either left or right-handed gamers.

of AI GPUs with a massive equity kicker, OpenAI to obtain up to 160 million AMD shares at one cent apiece ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OpenAI has secured up to 6 gigawatts of AMD GPU compute in a landmark supply agreement that could see the ChatGPT maker take a 10% stake in AMD.</p><p>The deal, announced on October 6, begins with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/amd-preps-rack-scale-instinct-mi450x-if128-with-128-gpus-to-challenge-nvidias-vr200-nvl144-in-2026\" target=\"_blank\"><u>AMD’s next-generation Instinct MI450 series</u></a> and spans multiple future product cycles. The first one-gigawatt tranche is scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2026, with follow-on deployments ramping up based on delivery and performance milestones. OpenAI’s warrant vests in stages and caps out at 160 million shares — almost a tenth of AMD’s outstanding stock — assuming the full 6GW is deployed and AMD’s share price triples from current levels.</p><p>That would make OpenAI one of AMD’s largest shareholders, and it gives both sides a reason to scale the partnership fast. But the partnership doesn’t represent a break with Nvidia. Sam Altman said via X.com that the AMD deal is incremental and that it will continue to expand Nvidia purchases alongside its MI450 deployments, adding that “The world needs much more compute…”</p><p>Last month, OpenAI and Nvidia outlined a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidia-and-openai-forge-usd100-billion-alliance-to-deliver-10-gigawatts-of-nvidia-hardware-for-ai-datacenters\"><u>separate 10GW roadmap</u></a> built around Nvidia’s next-generation platforms.</p><h2 id=\"more-than-a-backup-option-2\">More than a backup option</h2><p>The size of the partnership dispels the notion that AMD is merely a backup option for when Nvidia is unavailable. AMD confirmed that its work with OpenAI spans multiple generations of silicon, starting with MI450 and extending into future co-developed architectures, with AMD’s Forrest Norrod calling it “transformative” in remarks to <em>Reuters</em>.</p><p>OpenAI, for its part, has reportedly already evaluated AMD’s current-gen MI300X parts and is believed to be running production inference workloads on them now. While most high-profile model training still happens on Nvidia H100 clusters, the MI300X’s larger memory pool and high bandwidth design make it particularly well-suited to LLM inference. AMD has pitched that advantage before, but this is the first time it’s landed a customer of this size to prove it.</p><p>MI450 is expected to push those numbers even further, and will arrive around the same time Nvidia’s Blackwell-based GB200 platforms <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-shows-off-blackwell-server-installations-in-progress-ai-and-data-center-roadmap-has-blackwell-ultra-coming-next-year-with-vera-cpus-and-rubin-gpus-in-2026\"><u>begin volume deployment</u></a>. AMD has been unusually direct about the comparison. If it can deliver, AMD stands to capture not just incremental demand but also new market share. Nvidia’s H100 is already allocation-bound, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-says-its-h100-h200-gpus-are-not-sold-out-despite-jensen-alluding-otherwise-during-earnings-call-company-clarifies-it-has-plenty-of-gpu-supply\"><u>despite Nvidia saying it has plenty of supply</u></a>, and its upcoming Blackwell parts are expected to face similar constraints. AMD, starting from a smaller base, may have more headroom to scale in 2026 and 2027. For OpenAI, that flexibility may be more valuable than squeezing every last bit of throughput per watt.</p><h2 id=\"equity-for-volume-2\">Equity for volume</h2><p>The equity structure backing the deal is pretty aggressive. AMD is offering OpenAI the opportunity to purchase up to 160 million shares at $0.01 each, but only if it deploys the full 6 GW and AMD’s stock reaches the pre-agreed price targets along the way. The $600 ceiling would represent more than three times AMD’s pre-announcement trading price, implying a market cap north of half a trillion dollars. The company added nearly $80 billion in value when the deal was announced.</p><p>It’s not the first time OpenAI has used its purchasing power to secure financial upside. Microsoft’s initial investment in the company included infrastructure credits and profit participation. But this is the first time a chip supplier has offered equity in exchange for volume, and the first time OpenAI’s compute roadmap has been tied to a public stock price.</p><p>From AMD’s side, the warrant is a performance bet. It only vests if OpenAI buys and the market responds. AMD doesn’t hand over a single share until the first gigawatt is installed, and even then, only partially. That structure also helps insulate AMD from the downside risk of OpenAI’s custom silicon efforts, which are <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/open-ai-building-its-own-chip-still-dependent-on-nvidia\"><u>still in development with Broadcom</u></a> and have reportedly slipped behind schedule.</p><h2 id=\"amd-now-has-a-foothold-2\">AMD now has a foothold</h2><p>OpenAI is already building out the infrastructure to support the six-gigawatt deal. Its first <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month\"><u>Stargate data center campus in Texas</u></a> is being provisioned with nearly a gigawatt of on-site power generation just to keep pace with internal demand. That kind of buildout creates long lead-time demand not just for GPUs, but also for HBM, substrates, packaging, and data center cooling systems.</p><p>AMD’s MI450 and successors will face the same upstream constraints that have dogged Nvidia for the last two years, and AMD has not disclosed how it plans to scale supply at the required rate. It’s likely to pull from TSMC’s advanced packaging lines and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/amd-in-early-talks-to-use-ifs\"><u>may tap Intel Foundry</u></a> or U.S.-based subcontractors if TSMC’s U.S. fabs aren’t ready in time.</p><p>There are also obvious questions regarding software readiness. AMD’s <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-unveils-rocm-7-new-platform-boosts-ai-performance-up-to-3-5x-adds-radeon-gpu-support\"><u>ROCm platform</u></a> has made progress, and OpenAI’s endorsement will accelerate that. But most large-scale deployments today still assume CUDA-first development. Running the same model across Nvidia, AMD, and OpenAI’s future custom chips will require new levels of framework abstraction and operator portability, something OpenAI will need to tackle head-on as it balances workloads across suppliers.</p><p>What this deal shows is that achieving balance is OpenAI’s goal. The company isn’t walking away from Nvidia, but it’s not waiting around either. AMD now has a foothold, and if it can execute, a stake in its future that will be difficult to ignore.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

For ages, people have employed creative tricks to circumvent signing into a Microsoft account before getting into Windows, but the company is making it increasingly clear that it's not an option to skip this part.</p><p>In the patch notes for <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/10/06/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6772-dev-channel/\" target=\"_blank\">Insider Preview Build 26220.6772</a>, Microsoft explicitly mentions the removal of \"local-only commands\" and says these \"known mechanisms\" for bypassing online sign-ins are being addressed. It requires every user to log into their Microsoft account, or they'll end up skipping \"critical setup screens\" that will eventually crash the OOBE, forcing the user to start over. You must be connected to the internet throughout to \"ensure device is setup correctly.\" This also only affects direct installs, not managed devices.</p><p>One of the most popular ways to skip a Microsoft account sign-in was to use the <em>start ms cxh:local</em> only command, which is now removed. The Redmont giant <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/microsoft-eliminates-workaround-that-circumvents-microsoft-account-requirement-during-windows-11-installation\" target=\"_blank\">already disabled the \"bypassnro\" method</a> a few months ago, but there are still ways to get around this new barrier. The easiest route you can take is to run a script-based unattended installation, but not everyone will be aware (or comfortable) doing that, not to mention the sheer privacy concerns. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/how-to/install-windows-11-without-microsoft-account\" target=\"_blank\">Check out our guide</a> for more info.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:465px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:52.69%;\"><img id=\"e8WeNTRYHWLKgr8Voytsti\" name=\"1682549067.png\" alt=\"oobe bypassnro\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8WeNTRYHWLKgr8Voytsti.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"465\" height=\"245\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This tightening of policy comes at a time when Windows 10 is just a week away from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/windows/windows-10-extended-support-is-now-free-but-only-in-europe-microsoft-capitulates-on-controversial-usd30-esu-price-tag-which-remains-firmly-in-place-for-the-u-s\" target=\"_blank\">being phased out of active support</a>.

Microsoft tests new features in this channel, some of which make their way onto the Beta and Release Preview channels, from where a stable launch becomes imminent.

Overall, it’s reported that 400 positions will be cut due to these closures as the company migrates from 150mm to 300mm fabs.</p><p>Despite these cuts, Texas Instruments says that it remains committed to North Texas. Earlier this year, the company said that it would <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/texas-instruments-commits-usd60-billion-to-u-s-semiconductor-manufacturing-includes-planned-expansions-to-texas-utah-fabs\">invest $60 billion in semiconductor manufacturing</a>, including the expansion of its 300mm fabs in Texas and Utah. These are projected to create up to 60,000 new jobs, and employees who helped with the closure of its older plants will be given priority for openings at Texas Instruments’ upcoming facilities.</p><p>The company opened its 150mm fabs in Dallas and Sherman in the 1980s, but as technology progressed, Texas Instruments has since switched over to 300mm wafers. This is the current industry standard for high-volume production, providing better economies of scale. The expansion of Texas Instruments’ fabs in Texas and Utah has been covered by the Biden-era CHIPS and Science Act. Under this funding, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/texas-instruments-set-to-receive-up-to-dollar16-billion-in-chips-and-science-act-funding-for-utah-and-texas-fabs-expansion\">the company is set to receive $1.6 billion</a> for these projects, alongside an additional $8 billion in investment tax credits.</p><p>These new sites are expected to produce analog and embedded chips from 28nm to 130nm process nodes. Although these aren’t the latest, cutting-edge process nodes that <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-starts-construction-its-1-6nm-and-2nm-capable-u-s-fab-fab-21-phase-3\">TSMC plans to produce at its Arizona fabs</a>, they’re still crucial to several industries, like automotive and medicine.</p><p>The United States realized this vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, when border closures led to chip shortages affecting everything from cars to computers. Both the Biden and Trump administrations realized this, and they’re creating policies to expand semiconductor production within the U.S.</p><p>Biden’s CHIPS and Science Act has kick-started the construction of several semiconductor factories, particularly TSMC’s Arizona fab. Trump then expanded this with his policies. Only time will tell if these strategies will help America gain semiconductor independence or if it will have to continuously rely on Taiwan for the majority of chips.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></u></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><u><em>add us as a preferred source</em></u></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Instead of electrical contact switching, the Pro uses OmniPoint 2.0 Adjustable HyperMagnetic switches, which have user-configurable actuation points. Using this hall effect technology, it is possible to have one key trigger two actions, one at the first point, then another when pressed down further. This is one of the features you can configure in the SteelSeries GG software.</p><p>According to SteelSeries, these quiet linear-feel switches can be set to actuate at anything between 0.1mm to 4.0mm. This functionality lies behind the 'Rapid Trigger' feature of the keys. The maker asserts that users can actuate switches up to 20x faster, and also benefit from an 11x faster response.</p><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Switches</p></td><td  ><p>SteelSeries OmniPoint 2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Lighting</p></td><td  ><p>Per-Key RGB</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Onboard Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Media Keys</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-function key, volume roller</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Game Mode</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth, wired (USB-C)</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Additional Ports</p></td><td  ><p>N/A</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Keycaps</p></td><td  ><p>Double-shot PBT</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Construction</p></td><td  ><p>Plastic, aluminum alloy top plate</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>SteelSeries GG</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Dimensions (LxWxH)</p></td><td  ><p>14 x 5.04 x 1.65 inches / 355 x 128 x 42 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>1.65lbs / 747g (without cable)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The underlying technology might be the star of the show, for some, but the SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless has strong supporting features, too.</p><p>With wireless in the name, you may be drawn to the flexible connectivity of this product.

The site, which covers multiple buildings and up to 750,000 square feet of cleanroom, is scheduled to begin production in early 2028 following completion of the first factory in mid-2027.</p><p>The facility has already secured Apple and Nvidia as lead customers and will handle chip packaging for Apple silicon, which will be fabricated nearby at TSMC’s Arizona fabs. The U.S. Commerce Department previously awarded Amkor up to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/us-to-boost-chip-packaging-capacity-with-chips-act-grant-amkor-to-receive-dollar600-million-for-advanced-chip-packaging-facility\">$400 million in proposed CHIPS Act funding</a> for the project, calling it the largest outsourced advanced packaging facility in America. The initial phase carries a $2 billion investment, but Arizona officials say Amkor’s footprint could eventually grow to a $7 billion campus with as many as 3,000 jobs.</p><p>Less than an hour southeast, TSMC is ramping up a three-fab complex with its own CHIPS funding. The company’s Arizona roadmap calls for 4nm production in 2025, followed by 3nm in 2028 and 2nm-class A16 (1.6nm-class) <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/u-s-department-of-commerce-finalizes-usd6-6-billion-chips-act-funding-for-tsmc-fab-21-arizona-site\">before the decade’s end</a>. The Commerce Department has been explicit about the link between TSMC’s wafer output and the need for a domestic packaging partner, describing Amkor’s project as a key step toward end-to-end U.S. chip manufacturing. Although Intel operates its Foveros packaging hub across the state line in New Mexico, it is also expanding its Arizona wafer capacity with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/us-govts-chips-act-gives-intel-dollar85-billion-in-funding-and-a-25-tax-credit-on-dollar100-billion-in-investments\">two new fabs in Chandler</a>, also using CHIPS Act funding.</p><p>Advanced packaging is playing an increasingly important role with the rise of HBM and multi-die architectures. U.S. officials have identified packaging capacity as a critical vulnerability in the “fragile [chips] supply chain,” particularly for AI accelerators that rely on complex integration and fast interconnects. The National Institute of Standards and Technology has singled out 2.5D packaging as a major bottleneck for AI chips and GPUs, citing supply constraints that have delayed product launches and limited shipments.</p><p>Amkor’s Arizona campus is designed to address that gap directly, offering a domestic site for high-density integration and positioning itself as a key link between U.S.-based wafer production and finished AI systems. The project will draw on a workforce pipeline from local universities and marks a major re-entry into U.S. manufacturing for Amkor, which is headquartered in Arizona but does the bulk of its production overseas.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

These 1TB and 2TB prices bring the cost within the decidedly more pedestrian 990 Pro range.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more savings, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech\"><em>Best PC Hardware deals</em></a><em> for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds\"><em>SSD and Storage Deals,</em></a><em> </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals\"><em>Hard Drive Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals\"><em>Gaming Monitor Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-graphics-card-deals-now\"><em>Graphics Card Deals</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals\"><em>CPU Deals</em></a><em> pages.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/samsungs-top-tier-2tb-and-8tb-9100-pro-ssds-plummet-to-lowest-ever-prices-save-big-on-one-of-the-fastest-ssds-this-amazon-prime-day</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Samsung's 2TB 9100 Pro SSD plummets to lowest-ever price along with 8TB model ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">2AGhXydm6i9mXApnsJhzqJ</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsiBucSCE8fTo3AiwxLQ7a-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 12:15:01 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ stephen.warwick@futurenet.com (Stephen Warwick) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Stephen Warwick ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsiBucSCE8fTo3AiwxLQ7a-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung / Future]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[9100 Pro SSD deal]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[9100 Pro SSD deal]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsiBucSCE8fTo3AiwxLQ7a-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Samsung's 2TB 990 Pro drops to its lowest price since late 2023 in new Amazon Prime Day deal – speedy PCIe 4.0 drive dips to $133 without heatsink ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you're looking for a super-fast Windows boot drive or games drive with ample storage, the Samsung 990 Pro 2TB is easy to recommend at its <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Internal-Expansion-MZ-V9P2T0B-AM/dp/B0BHJJ9Y77?th=1\">current sale price at Amazon of just $133.</a> It's no longer the fastest drive around, but if you don't have a motherboard or system that supports PCIe 5.0, then this is still one of the fastest SSDs you can get your hands on.</p><p>While this long-lived drive has been cheaper, you'd have to go back to late 2023 to find the 2TB 990 Pro selling for less than it is right now.

His assistant acquires 5kg of gold, and then he gets down to taking apart a ‘regular’ ROG Astral, in order to make casting molds to replace its structure with real gold. This is fun to watch, and even if you don’t know a word of Mandarin, the step-by-step process is easy to grasp.</p><p>During the process, we see the gold being melted, poured into the carefully prepared molds, and taken out for fine finishing. Finally, after many false starts and casting errors over several months of work, Tony could reconstruct his ROG Astral, with the real gold parts fitted.</p><p>As well as the solid gold elements we see made, the cooling assembly, with its many fins, is seen being plated with gold. The result is a pleasingly finely detailed yet garishly gleaming graphics card, dripping in genuine gold.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1871px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.06%;\"><img id=\"PP4FYTfEcZXSx4H2PaRYQA\" name=\"casting\" alt=\"Solid gold ROG Astral RTX 5090D\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PP4FYTfEcZXSx4H2PaRYQA.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1871\" height=\"1236\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Asus ROG China)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1554px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:59.65%;\"><img id=\"QgaLU4YvcHRWy5Ef7FSoPA\" name=\"ordinary-astral\" alt=\"Solid gold ROG Astral RTX 5090D\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QgaLU4YvcHRWy5Ef7FSoPA.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1554\" height=\"927\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Asus ROG China)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1749px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:69.01%;\"><img id=\"hDwdttHxq4DCN3LbukJDPA\" name=\"some-gold\" alt=\"Solid gold ROG Astral RTX 5090D\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hDwdttHxq4DCN3LbukJDPA.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1749\" height=\"1207\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Asus ROG China)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id=\"gold-content-5kg-vs-6-5g-11-pounds-vs-a-quarter-ounce-2\">Gold content: 5kg vs 6.5g (11 pounds vs a quarter ounce)</h2><p>The contrast between this custom model and the ‘standard’ <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/asus-rolls-out-golden-rtx-5090-for-buyers-with-deep-pockets-rog-astral-geforce-rtx-5090-dhahab-oc-edition-for-the-middle-eastern-market\">Asus ROG Golden Dhabab</a> is pretty stark – not just in pricing.

Crucially, our model featured a slightly more powerful i7-13620H and 16GB of RAM. As such, it wouldn't be representative to share gaming performance figures from our previous review. However, this $599 model shares the same GPU, SSD, display (the refresh rate is actually higher), and chassis.</p><p>Overall, we really like the Nitro V 15's look, with a generally understated design and some pretty cool graphics on the lid. The body is plastic throughout but feels sturdy, and certainly not cheap. There are plenty of ports, including Ethernet, USB-C, and USB-A.</p><p>The display is pretty muted, but that's to be expected at this price range. Crucially, the Nitro V range offers decent upgradeability, with two DDR5 SODIMM RAM slots so you can upgrade the 8GB onboard to up to 32GB. There are also two M.2 2280 SSD slots for storage expansion, and a replaceable battery.</p><p>The 4050, carrying just 6GB of RAM, will be a limitation for many games, but for less taxing titles, it should see you through. The value in this laptop lies in its very cheap entry-level price, and the potential to boost both RAM and storage if you're willing to spend some time with a screwdriver. This deal would suit a college student or a burgeoning young gamer, and would be best suited as a laptop for productivity with a little gaming on the side, or for anyone who wants to play more casual titles on the go.</p><p><em>If you're looking for more savings, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-deals-on-tech\"><em>Best PC Hardware deals</em></a><em> for a range of products, or dive deeper into our specialized </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-deals-on-ssds\"><em>SSD and Storage Deals,</em></a><em> </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/best-hard-drive-deals\"><em>Hard Drive Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-computer-monitor-deals\"><em>Gaming Monitor Deals</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/best-graphics-card-deals-now\"><em>Graphics Card Deals</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/features/best-cpu-deals\"><em>CPU Deals</em></a><em> pages.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/the-cheapest-amazon-prime-day-gaming-laptop-is-this-usd599-acer-nitro-v-squeezing-in-an-intel-core-i5-and-rtx-4050-with-room-to-upgrade-your-ram</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ The cheapest gaming laptop you can buy on Amazon right now is this $599 Acer Nitro V. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">RFz7oT3oCESMV9QCAmCqiX</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k2BNfxe7SFZPbDGTUHyuf-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 10:20:14 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ stephen.warwick@futurenet.com (Stephen Warwick) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Stephen Warwick ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k2BNfxe7SFZPbDGTUHyuf-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Acer / Future]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Acer Nitro v prime day]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Acer Nitro v prime day]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k2BNfxe7SFZPbDGTUHyuf-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Cooler Master's compact NR2 Pro Mini ITX small form factor gaming rig comes armed with a 9800X3D and RTX 5070 Ti, packing raw power and good looks — save $497 in this Prime Day deal ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the biggest problems with looking for Amazon Prime Big Deals Day deals is that you keep coming across deals that you want to buy for yourself. Luckily, I already own a gaming PC that's very similar in its component parts selection, but it is not a small form factor build, and I've got to admit, I really like the look of this prebuilt PC. It's very cute, wouldn't take up much room on or under a desk, and did I already mention that it looks amazing?</p><p>This prebuilt PC deal is available at Amazon, where the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-NR2-Pro-Mini/dp/B0F1DX3BMF\">Cooler Master NR2 Pro Mini ITX is on a significant deal for just $2052.99</a>. Checking price comparison tools such as CamelCamelCamel, the Cooler Master NR2 Pro Mini ITX has a max MSRP price of $3499.99, with the average list price of $2549.99. This means you're realistically saving around 19% or $497.00 on the average list price this Prime Day. You can, of course, build a similar PC yourself for slightly less, but if you're not comfortable constructing your own computer Lego, and fancy a more combined warranty solution, then this could well be the solution for you.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays\">Check out all deals on Amazon</a></li></ul><p>The Cooler Master chassis used is the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cooler-master-nr200p-max-review/2\">NR200P Max, a case that we've reviewed</a> and gave high praise for.  For a small case, the NR220P has great airflow and cooling potential, plus plenty of space to fit the latest components, especially large GPUs like the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti. The case sports tidy cable management (a rarity, for ITX cases) and mesh panelling for better airflow into the case.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"c16f8df4-9a00-4271-b557-910d86dbd73c\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"Cooler Master's NR2 Pro Mini ITX utilizes the NR200P Max small form factor case and pairs the most powerful gaming CPU, AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, with Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti graphics card.

The 9800X3D holds the throne as the fastest gaming CPU on the market in quite a convincing fashion when tested and compared against the competition. Our benchmarks show it beats Intel’s current-gen flagship Core 9 285K by an almost unrealistic 35% on average in our test suite, and even beats Intel’s fastest competing gaming chip, the Core i9-14900K, by an equally incredible 30% on average in our test suite of game titles.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex;

href=\"https://3dprintopia.com/\"><u>3DPrintopia, a celebration of all things 3D printing</u></a>. The event is an eclectic mix of the latest tech, mixed with homebrew 3D printers, merchants, and geeks showing off their latest projects. Over 3000 visitors and hundreds of exhibitors gathered, from big company CEOs to Cub Scouts racing their first 3D printed (not-a-pinewood) derby car.</p><p>Started in 2018 as the East Coast RepRap Festival, the event has outgrown the community college basketball court it called home for the last several years. In 2026, 3DPrintopia will move to the massive Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, with 63,000 square feet of space to spread out on.</p><h2 id=\"josef-prusa-announces-space-age-filament-and-gets-a-selfie-with-a-bot-2\">Josef Průša Announces Space Age Filament and Gets a Selfie with a Bot</h2><p>Prusa Research CEO Josef Průša was seen at the festival, greeting old friends and checking out new makes, printed by fans of his 3D printers. Ryan Reid had quite the showstopper with his COREBot, a battery-powered CORE One printer mounted on remote-controlled treads that could print while being driven around the festival floor.</p><p>Later in the festival, Průša announced a new “space age” filament, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pc-space-grade-black-850g/\"><u>PC Space Grade Black</u></a>, which was developed in cooperation with the Czech space company TRL Space. The material is ESD-safe and has low outgassing properties, and can be printed on a CORE One 3D printer. “We shared the spec sheet with our friends from NASA and their reaction for that it’s too good to be true,” he said. Here on Earth, the polycarbonate material is useful for 3D printing electronic cases and, in certain applications, can be used as an alternative to the costly and difficult-to-print PEEK.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"BRKDz9h7U4Nos6rpFUpXGi\" name=\"image7\" alt=\"3DPrintopia 2025\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BRKDz9h7U4Nos6rpFUpXGi.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\"><em>Ryan Reid and Josef Průša with the COREBot, photo by Alan \"Pooch\" Puccinelli.

I didn’t want any of that,\" Tobin said. \"I wanted to use additive manufacturing for functionality. I wanted these to be shoes that you could wear and no one knows you’re wearing 3D printed shoes.” His shoes are designed with skateboarding in mind, have plenty of air flow, and are also machine washable. (Just keep them out of the dryer.)</p><p>Unlike other 3D printed shoes we’ve been seeing around convention halls in 2025, these are professionally 3D printed by Zellerfeld, which also makes the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.zellerfeld.com/products/air-max-1000\"><u>NIKE Air Max 1000</u></a>.

Co-owner Melissa Kaye said CookieCad will kick off 2025 by donating 500 spools of colorful filament to partner organizations like <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://makegood.design/\"><u>MakeGood</u></a>, the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://thecontrollerproject.com/\"><u>Controller Project</u></a> and the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.sanjaymortimerfoundation.org/\"><u>Sanjay Mortimer Foundation</u></a>. She said the company has plans to increase donations as more partners join the program.</p><p>Controller Project founder Caleb Kraft said accessibility tools too often look medical and boring. CookieCAD makes PLA, PETG, ABS, and TPU in fun, sparkly colors, which is even more important for MakeGood, which creates kids’ mobility devices. Philip Dunham, a designer from MakeGood, said it's amazing how modern 3D printers allow him to print customized adaptive devices for users that would never be commercially viable with injection molding.</p><p>At the CookieCad booth, Dunham showed off a fully 3D printed toddler mobility trainer printed in bright pink PETG with a neon yellow TPU seat and wheels.</p><p>To apply to become a CookieCAD Cares partner, organizations must be a registered nonprofit, community-based group, or accredited school.

The GPU can provide a competent gaming experience at 1080p or 1440p, thanks to its 4,096 shader cores, 2.97GHz boost clock, 64 MB of L2 cache, and 16GB of VRAM wired to a 256-bit interface.</p><p>In our benchmarks, the RX 9070 16GB often outperforms the RTX 5070, particularly in rasterization benchmarks. For example, at 4K native resolution, the RX 9070 beats the RTX 5070 by 11% in our 16-game rasterization-only geomean.</p><p>The extra 4GB of VRAM further helps the RX 9070 in memory-bound titles. Games are getting more and more demanding, and while 12GB of VRAM can generally get you by in most games, we are starting to see that amount being a limiting factor when pushing ultra settings. 16GB gives you more memory overhead, and is a capacity that is capable of enabling modern high-performance GPUs to run any game today at maximum settings at 4K resolution.</p><p>If you want a more in-depth comparison, check out our <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-rtx-5070-vs-amd-rx-9070-face-off\">RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 face-off</a>.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:75.00%;\"><img id=\"NPo95Za885BYBPRNwgKNCc\" name=\"RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 Benchmark Comparison\" alt=\"RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 Benchmark Comparison\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPo95Za885BYBPRNwgKNCc.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:75.00%;\"><img id=\"2kxVpdnQnq8EUTbo3qSyBc\" name=\"RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 Benchmark Comparison\" alt=\"RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 Benchmark Comparison\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kxVpdnQnq8EUTbo3qSyBc.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:75.00%;\"><img id=\"WjAZWV29hyB9QK6beTXpCc\" name=\"RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 Benchmark Comparison\" alt=\"RTX 5070 vs RX 9070 Benchmark Comparison\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WjAZWV29hyB9QK6beTXpCc.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1440\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>At $549, the ASRock Challenger RX 9070 16GB is an excellent deal in a market where GPU sales don't often exceed 5% of the GPU's value.

From high capacity and no compromises, to wicked-fast TLC performance, to crazy levels of bang-for-your-buck, these drives offer something for every handheld gamer.</p><p>The Crucial P310 2230 is undoubtedly the star of the show today. $121.99 for 2TB of  M.2 storage from a highly reputable vendor like Crucial is attractive on its own, but that same price in the itty-bitty M.2-2230 size is beyond compare. The drive received <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/crucial-p310-ssd-review\">very high marks from our reviewer</a> at its launch, and to this day, it is the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck\">second-fastest 2TB M.2-2230 SSD</a> that <em>Tom's Hardware</em> has ever tested. Its QLC memory makes it more power-efficient than the 2TB flavor of the WD Black 2230 competitor below it on this list, and just a hair faster in our testing. Top read/write speeds of 7,100 / 6,000 MB/s push the drive close to the limits of its PCIe 4.0 connection, and 2TB of storage make it likely to serve you well for a good while, even with heavy downloading.</p><p>Of course, for those looking for highly increased longevity along with higher performance at the cost of some battery life, TLC SSDs are the way to go. And for TLC hunters, look no further than the WD Black SN770M. This tiny drive also got a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/wd-black-sn770m-2230-ssd-review\">four-star review</a> at the time of release, and it still holds as the bronze medalist in our rankings of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-ssd-for-steam-deck\">best Steam Deck SSDs</a>. The TLC SSD has powerful performance in both its 1TB and 2TB offerings, with the 1TB today representing an incredible deal price. The warranty and software support the WD Black line is known for are nice additions here, and the power-without-compromise promises of the SN770M make it a scary good pick for gamers on the go.</p><p>For those on a tighter gaming budget, we don't blame you for steering clear of the kingly options higher on the list. The Kingston NV3 is a killer budget drive most days, and at today's Newegg sale price, it becomes a serious contender. As we found in our <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ssds/kingston-nv3-ssd-review\">review of the drive</a>'s standard length cousin, the M.2-2280 NV3, the SSD has solid performance among budget drives, and runs quite a bit cooler than either the Crucial P310 or SN770M. Plus, Kingston is a well-regarded name in storage and memory, making it arguably a safer acquisition than any number of other budget drives from lesser-known vendors. And of course, those without a Prime account have Newegg to turn to for this deal.</p><p>For those with a Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Ally X, MSI Claw, Lenovo Legion Go, or even some newer Windows Surface models, upgrading storage can be a bit of a hassle. These devices only accept storage drives at the littlest end of the M.2 pack, already a tiny form factor family. M.2-2230 drives, as a result, have tended to run high in price compared to the gumstick-length 2280 form factor.

So far this week, we've seen some of the Prime Day deals this year, beating out Amazon and other retailers' sales earlier in the year.</p><p>If you visit the MSI website, you can find today's deal on the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/Motherboards/AMD-Platform-Motherboard/AMD-X870/MAG-X870-TOMAHAWK-WIFI\" target=\"_blank\">MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard, AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, and 2TB MSI Spatium M480 Pro SSD, all</a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/Motherboards/AMD-Platform-Motherboard/AMD-X870/MAG-X870-TOMAHAWK-WIFI\"> available as a bundle for just $738.99</a>. There are no codes or coupons to add to achieve this price. To add the 9800X3D and the 2TB Spatium M480 Pro to the combination bundle, simply select them from the drop-down menus.</p><p>Buying the components separately on Amazon results in a total of $903.73: $476.99 (the lowest available price, according to PCPartpicker) for the 9800X3D, $259.99 for the MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi, and $166.75 for the 2TB Spatium M480 Pro. You can, of course, choose not to go with the SSD and simply select the MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi motherboard and AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D for just $639.99.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://us-store.msi.com/Motherboards/AMD-Platform-Motherboard/AMD-X870/MAG-X870-TOMAHAWK-WIFI\">Check out the deal at MSI</a></li></ul><p>The Ryzen 7 9800X3D features eight cores and 16 threads, with a TDP of 120W.

The large 3D V-cache boosts performance, and along with design changes to the CPU, such as moving the cache chiplet underneath the die to alleviate the thermal insulation of previous designs, the compute die is now closer to the cooler. With this increased thermal headroom comes 500 MHz higher base clocks and 200 MHz higher boosts than the previous-gen Zen 4-powered Ryzen 7 7800X3D.</p><div class=\"product star-deal\"><a data-dimension112=\"c16f8df4-9a00-4271-b557-910d86dbd73c\" data-action=\"Star Deal Block\" data-label=\"MSI's combo deal pairs the MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk with AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D processor and a 2TB Gen 4 PCIe Spatium M480 Pro SSD (you must add the items to the dropdown menu).

So, when the company tells you to stop illegally distributing games, you should probably listen. But that doesn't seem to be the case for \"Archbox,\" who served as the primary moderator of the r/SwitchPirates subreddit for some time, before he was charged last year for selling pirated games.</p><p>Originally reported by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-seeking-4-5-million-in-damages-from-switch-piracy-reddit-mod/\" target=\"_blank\">Nintendo Everything</a>, the company is now seeking a $4.5 million default judgment because the defendant never showed up for the court proceedings. Archbox, whose real name is James Williams, is popular in the Switch modding community. He reportedly ran several pirating sites, along with \"shops\" — such as JITS — where games are available to download on jailbroken Switch consoles. James not only tested Nintendo's patience pertaining to its intellectual property, but committed the cardinal sin of piracy while doing so: charging money for it.</p><p>\"Since 2019, Williams has been either directly or indirectly the owner, manager, operator, creator, administrator, supplier, and/or overseer of several online Pirate Shops, and has worked to actively promote these Pirate Shops to communities consisting of many thousands of individuals,\" reads the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">official filing</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1nyejj4/comment/nhub4ym/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\" target=\"_blank\">According to online discussion</a>, James asked for donations to give access to \"pro\" subscriptions, where people would be able to download games a lot faster, likely with uncapped speeds. Those who often sail the seas know never to hide pirated content behind a paywall, because that then constitutes grounds for a lawsuit. Nice-guy Nintendo even first warned James by sending a cease-and-desist through a law firm last year, but he reportedly never responded.</p><p>The lawfirm, <em>Mitchell Silberberg & Knupp</em>, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/surprise-nintendo-tracked-down-alleged-switch-pirate-in-arizona-via-reddit-posts-and-repair-orders\" target=\"_blank\">investigated a number of online piracy storefronts</a> and identified James as one of the leading kingpins, who was then located through email addresses tied to repair orders in Surprise, Arizona (yes, that's a real city). This happened before the Switch 2 was announced, which meant that Nintendo was more rigorously protecting the now-outdated console. But the company likely has more than enough lawyers and resources to keep an eye on any platform where it sees its products being pirated.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"jicsBbmavzfiGuLrA5RDSS\" name=\"switch-hands-mkw\" alt=\"Nintendo Switch 2 playing Mario Kart World\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jicsBbmavzfiGuLrA5RDSS.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Nintendo Switch 2 is now Nintendo's flagship console </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo argues that Archbox has illegally distributed \"thousands, if not hundreds of thousands\" of games so far, and wants to recoup the amount it lost out on.

The agent then uses this memory during inference to avoid repeating past mistakes and make better decisions as it faces new problems. The researchers show that when combined with <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-test-time-scaling-unlocks-hidden-reasoning-abilities-in-small-language-models-and-allows-them-to-outperform-llms\"><u>test-time scaling techniques</u></a>, where an agent makes multiple attempts at a problem, ReasoningBank significantly improves the performance and efficiency of LLM agents.</p><p>Their findings show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms classic memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, offering a practical path toward building more adaptive and reliable AI agents for enterprise applications.</p><h2>The challenge of LLM agent memory</h2><p>As LLM agents are deployed in applications that run for long periods, they encounter a continuous stream of tasks. One of the key limitations of current LLM agents is their failure to learn from this accumulated experience. By approaching each task in isolation, they inevitably repeat past mistakes, discard valuable insights from related problems, and fail to develop skills that would make them more capable over time.</p><p>The solution to this limitation is to give agents some kind of memory. Previous efforts to give agents memory have focused on storing past interactions for reuse by organizing information in various forms from plain text to structured graphs. However, these approaches often fall short. Many use raw interaction logs or only store successful task examples. This means they can&#x27;t distill higher-level, transferable reasoning patterns and, crucially, they don’t extract and use the valuable information from the agent’s failures. As the researchers note in their paper, “existing memory designs often remain limited to passive record-keeping rather than providing actionable, generalizable guidance for future decisions.”</p><h2>How ReasoningBank works</h2><p>ReasoningBank is a memory framework designed to overcome these limitations. Its central idea is to distill useful strategies and reasoning hints from past experiences into structured memory items that can be stored and reused.</p><p>According to Jun Yan, a Research Scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this marks a fundamental shift in how agents operate. &quot;Traditional agents operate statically—each task is processed in isolation,&quot; Yan explained. &quot;ReasoningBank changes this by turning every task experience (successful or failed) into structured, reusable reasoning memory. As a result, the agent doesn’t start from scratch with each customer; it recalls and adapts proven strategies from similar past cases.&quot;</p><p>The framework processes both successful and failed experiences and turns them into a collection of useful strategies and preventive lessons. The agent judges success and failure through <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-self-taught-evaluator-enables-llms-to-create-their-own-training-data\"><u>LLM-as-a-judge schemes</u></a> to obviate the need for human labeling.</p><p>Yan provides a practical example of this process in action. An agent tasked with finding Sony headphones might fail because its broad search query returns over 4,000 irrelevant products. &quot;ReasoningBank will first try to figure out why this approach failed,&quot; Yan said. &quot;It will then distill strategies such as ‘optimize search query’ and ‘confine products with category filtering.’ Those strategies will be extremely useful to get future similar tasks successfully done.&quot;</p><p>The process operates in a closed loop. When an agent faces a new task, it uses an embedding-based search to retrieve relevant memories from ReasoningBank to guide its actions. These memories are inserted into the agent’s system prompt, providing context for its decision-making. Once the task is completed, the framework creates new memory items to extract insights from successes and failures. This new knowledge is then analyzed, distilled, and merged into the ReasoningBank, allowing the agent to continuously evolve and improve its capabilities.</p><h2>Supercharging memory with scaling</h2><p>The researchers found a powerful synergy between memory and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepmind-new-inference-time-scaling-technique-improves-planning-accuracy-in-llms\"><u>test-time scaling</u></a>. Classic test-time scaling involves generating multiple independent answers to the same question, but the researchers argue that this “vanilla form is suboptimal because it does not leverage inherent contrastive signal that arises from redundant exploration on the same problem.”</p><p>To address this, they propose Memory-aware Test-Time Scaling (MaTTS), which integrates scaling with ReasoningBank. MaTTS comes in two forms. In “parallel scaling,” the system generates multiple trajectories for the same query, then compares and contrasts them to identify consistent reasoning patterns. In sequential scaling, the agent iteratively refines its reasoning within a single attempt, with the intermediate notes and corrections also serving as valuable memory signals.</p><p>This creates a virtuous cycle: the existing memory in ReasoningBank steers the agent toward more promising solutions, while the diverse experiences generated through scaling enable the agent to create higher-quality memories to store in ReasoningBank. </p><p>“This positive feedback loop positions memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension for agents,” the researchers write.</p><h2>ReasoningBank in action</h2><p>The researchers tested their framework on <a href=\"https://webarena.dev/\"><u>WebArena </u></a>(web browsing) and <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\"><u>SWE-Bench-Verified</u></a> (software engineering) benchmarks, using models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. They compared ReasoningBank against baselines including memory-free agents and agents using trajectory-based or workflow-based memory frameworks.</p><p>The results show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms these baselines across all datasets and LLM backbones. On WebArena, it improved the overall success rate by up to 8.3 percentage points compared to a memory-free agent. It also generalized better on more difficult, cross-domain tasks, while reducing the number of interaction steps needed to complete tasks. When combined with MaTTS, both parallel and sequential scaling further boosted performance, consistently outperforming standard test-time scaling.</p><p>This efficiency gain has a direct impact on operational costs. Yan points to a case where a memory-free agent took eight trial-and-error steps just to find the right product filter on a website. &quot;Those trial and error costs could be avoided by leveraging relevant insights from ReasoningBank,&quot; he noted. &quot;In this case, we save almost twice the operational costs,&quot; which also improves the user experience by resolving issues faster.</p><p>For enterprises, ReasoningBank can help develop cost-effective agents that can learn from experience and adapt over time in complex workflows and areas like software development, customer support, and data analysis. As the paper concludes, “Our findings suggest a practical pathway toward building adaptive and lifelong-learning agents.”</p><p>Yan confirmed that their findings point toward a future of truly compositional intelligence. For example, a coding agent could learn discrete skills like API integration and database management from separate tasks. &quot;Over time, these modular skills... become building blocks the agent can flexibly recombine to solve more complex tasks,&quot; he said, suggesting a future where agents can autonomously assemble their knowledge to manage entire workflows with minimal human oversight.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>bendee983@gmail.com (Ben Dickson)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/39zNK5TPsGY3tZEmUTjk69/dd9b6dccec081ae2be6dea6d03bac8a1/Robot_arranging_memory.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpg\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[To scale agentic AI, Notion tore down its tech stack and started fresh]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/to-scale-agentic-ai-notion-tore-down-its-tech-stack-and-started-fresh</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5MqQ3qRMIwDmlYOr8NeKk4</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 21:08:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many organizations would be hesitant to overhaul their tech stack and start from scratch. \n\nNot <a href=\"https://www.notion.com/\">Notion</a>. \n\nFor the 3.0 version of its productivity software (released in September), the company didn’t hesitate to rebuild from the ground up; they recognized that it was necessary, in fact, to support agentic AI at enterprise scale.\n\nWhereas traditional AI-powered workflows involve explicit, step-by-step instructions based on few-shot learning, AI agents powered by advanced reasoning models are thoughtful about tool definition, can identify and comprehend what tools they have at their disposal and plan next steps. \n\n“Rather than trying to retrofit into what we were building, we wanted to play to the strengths of reasoning models,” Sarah Sachs, Notion’s head of AI modeling, told VentureBeat. “We&#x27;ve rebuilt a new architecture because workflows are different from agents.”</p><h2>Re-orchestrating so models can work autonomously</h2><p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/notion-bets-big-on-integrated-llms-adds-gpt-4-1-and-claude-3-7-to-platform\">Notion</a> has been adopted by 94% of Forbes AI 50 companies, has 100 million total users and counts among its customers OpenAI, Cursor, Figma, Ramp and Vercel. \n\nIn a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the company identified the need to move beyond simpler, task-based workflows to goal-oriented reasoning systems that allow agents to autonomously select, orchestrate, and execute tools across connected environments. </p><p>Very quickly, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/teaching-the-model-designing-llm-feedback-loops-that-get-smarter-over-time\">reasoning models</a> have become “far better” at learning to use tools and follow chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions, Sachs noted. This allows them to be “far more independent” and make multiple decisions within one agentic workflow. “We rebuilt our AI system to play to that,&quot; she said. \n\nFrom an engineering perspective, this meant replacing rigid prompt-based flows with a unified orchestration model, Sachs explained. This core model is supported by modular sub-agents that search Notion and the web, query and add to databases and edit content. \n\nEach agent uses tools contextually; for instance, they can decide whether to search Notion itself, or another platform like Slack. The model will perform successive searches until the relevant information is found. It can then, for instance, convert notes into proposals, create follow-up messages, track tasks, and spot and make updates in knowledge bases. \n\nIn Notion 2.0, the team focused on having AI perform specific tasks, which required them to “think exhaustively” about how to prompt the model, Sachs noted. However, with version 3.0, users can assign tasks to agents, and agents can actually take action and perform multiple tasks concurrently.  \n\n“We reorchestrated it to be self-selecting on the tools, rather than few-shotting, which is explicitly prompting how to go through all these different scenarios,” Sachs explained. The aim is to ensure everything interfaces with AI and that “anything you can do, your Notion agent can do.”</p><h2>Bifurcating to isolate hallucinations</h2><p>Notion’s philosophy of “better, faster, cheaper,” drives a continuous iteration cycle that balances latency and accuracy through fine-tuned vector embeddings and elastic search optimization. Sachs’ team employs a rigorous evaluation framework that combines deterministic tests, vernacular optimization, human-annotated data and LLMs-as-a-judge, with model-based scoring identifying discrepancies and inaccuracies. \n\n“By bifurcating the evaluation, we&#x27;re able to identify where the problems come from, and that helps us isolate unnecessary hallucinations,” Sachs explained. Further, making the architecture itself simpler means it’s easier to make changes as models and techniques evolve. \n\n“We optimize latency and parallel thinking as much as possible,” which leads to “way better accuracy,” Sachs noted. Models are grounded in data from the web and the Notion connected workspace. \n\nUltimately, Sachs reported, the investment in rebuilding its architecture has already provided Notion returns in terms of capability and faster rate of change. \n\nShe added, “We are fully open to rebuilding it again, when the next breakthrough happens, if we have to.”</p><h2>Understanding contextual latency</h2><p>When building and fine-tuning models, it’s important to understand that latency is subjective: AI must provide the most relevant information, not necessarily the most, at the cost of speed. \n\n“You&#x27;d be surprised at the different ways customers are willing to wait for things and not wait for things,” Sachs said. It makes for an interesting experiment: How slow can you go before people abandon the model?\n\nWith pure navigational search, for instance, users may not be as patient; they want answers near-immediately. “If you ask, ‘What&#x27;s two plus two,’ you don&#x27;t want to wait for your agent to be searching everywhere in Slack and JIRA,” Sachs pointed out. \n\nBut the longer the time it&#x27;s given, the more exhaustive a reasoning agent can be. For instance, Notion can perform <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-anti-chatgpt-thomson-reuters-multi-agent-system-slashes-20-hour-tasks-to\">20 minutes of autonomous work</a> across hundreds of websites, files and other materials. In these instances, users are more willing to wait, Sachs explained; they allow the model to execute in the background while they attend to other tasks. \n\n“It&#x27;s a product question,” said Sachs. “How do we set user expectations from the UI? How do we ascertain user expectations on latency?”</p><h2>Notion is its biggest user</h2><p>Notion understands the importance of using its own product — in fact, its employees are among its biggest power users. \n\nSachs explained that teams have active sandboxes that generate training and evaluation data, as well as a “really active” thumbs-up-thumbs-down user feedback loop. Users aren’t shy about saying what they think should be improved or features they’d like to see. \n\nSachs emphasized that when a user thumbs down an interaction, they are explicitly giving permission to a human annotator to analyze that interaction in a way that de-anonymizes them as much as possible. \n\n“We are using our own tool as a company all day, every day, and so we get really fast feedback loops,” said Sachs. “We’re really dogfooding our own product.” \n\nThat said, it’s their own product they’re building, Sachs noted, so they understand that they may have goggles on when it comes to quality and functionality. To balance this out, Notion has trusted &quot;very AI-savvy&quot; design partners who are granted early access to new capabilities and provide important feedback. \n\nSachs emphasized that this is just as important as internal prototyping. \n\n“We&#x27;re all about experimenting in the open, I think you get much richer feedback,” said Sachs. “Because at the end of the day, if we just look at how Notion uses Notion, we&#x27;re not really giving the best experience to our customers.” \n\nJust as importantly, continuous internal testing allows teams to evaluate progressions and make sure models aren&#x27;t regressing (when accuracy and performance degrades over time). &quot;Everything you&#x27;re doing stays faithful,&quot; Sachs explained. &quot;You know that your latency is within bounds.&quot; </p><p>Many companies make the mistake of focusing too intensely on retroactively-focused evans; this makes it difficult for them to understand how or where they&#x27;re improving, Sachs pointed out. Notion considers evals as a &quot;litmus test&quot; of development and forward-looking progression and evals of observability and regression proofing. \n\n“I think a big mistake a lot of companies make is conflating the two,” said Sachs. “We use them for both purposes; we think about them really differently.”</p><h2>Takeaways from Notion&#x27;s journey</h2><p>For enterprises, Notion can serve as a blueprint for how to responsibly and dynamically operationalize agentic AI in a connected, permissioned enterprise workspace. \n\nSach’s takeaways for other tech leaders: </p><ul><li><p>Don’t be afraid to rebuild when foundational capabilities change; Notion fully re-engineered its architecture to align with reasoning-based models.</p></li><li><p>Treat latency as contextual: Optimize per use case, rather than universally. </p></li><li><p>Ground all outputs in trustworthy, curated enterprise data to ensure accuracy and trust. \n\nShe advised: “Be willing to make the hard decisions. Be willing to sit at the top of the frontier, so to speak, on what you&#x27;re developing to build the best product you can for your customers.” </p></li></ul><p></p>]]></description>\n            <author>taryn.plumb@venturebeat.com (Taryn Plumb)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4UhFQT7cP4EsW10hrJr6Tj/c13730af61d302ca31c26f54c8253fca/Notion.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Here’s what Jony Ive and Sam Altman revealed about their secretive AI hardware project at OpenAI’s Dev Day]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/heres-what-jony-ive-and-sam-altman-revealed-about-their-secretive-ai</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">1YKwWfuOGMo8qJEUtmcu3z</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:40:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>In a packed theater at Fort Mason, after a whirlwind keynote of product announcements, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> CEO Sam Altman sat down with Sir Jony Ive, the legendary designer behind Apple&#x27;s most iconic products. The conversation, held exclusively for the 1,500 developers in attendance and not part of the public livestream, offered the clearest glimpse yet into the philosophy and ambition behind their secretive collaboration to build a new &quot;family&quot; of AI-powered devices.</p><p>The partnership, solidified by OpenAI&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/technology/openai-jony-ive-deal.html\"><u>staggering $6.5 billion acquisition</u></a> of Ive&#x27;s hardware startup Io in May, has been the subject of intense speculation.While concrete product details remained under wraps, the discussion pivoted away from specifications and toward a profound, almost therapeutic mission: to fix our broken relationship with technology.</p><p>For nearly 45 minutes, Ive, in his signature thoughtful cadence, articulated a vision that feels like both a continuation of and a repentance for his life&#x27;s work. The man who designed the iPhone, a device that arguably defined the modern era of personal computing, is now on a quest to cure the very anxieties it helped create.</p><h2>Jony Ive&#x27;s post-Apple mission, clarified by ChatGPT</h2><p>The collaboration, Ive explained, was years in the making, but it was the launch of ChatGPT that provided a sudden, clarifying purpose for his post-Apple design collective, <a href=\"https://www.lovefrom.com/\"><u>LoveFrom</u></a>.</p><p>&quot;With the launch of ChatGPT, it felt like our purpose for the last six years became clear,&quot; Ive said. &quot;We were starting to develop some ideas for an interface based on the capability of the technology these guys were developing... I&#x27;ve never in my career come across anything vaguely like the affordance, like the capability that we&#x27;re now starting to sense.&quot;</p><p>This capability, he argued, demands a fundamental rethinking of the devices we use, which he described as &quot;legacy products&quot; from a bygone era. The core motivation, he stressed, is not about corporate agendas but about a sense of duty to humanity.</p><p>&quot;The reason we&#x27;re doing this is we love our species and we want to be useful,&quot; Ive said. &quot;We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given.&quot;</p><h2>An &#x27;obscene understatement&#x27;: Jony Ive&#x27;s quest to cure our tech anxiety</h2><p>The most striking theme of the conversation was Ive&#x27;s candid critique of the current state of technology — the very ecosystem he was instrumental in building. He described our current dynamic with our devices as deeply flawed, a problem he now sees AI as the solution to, not an extension of.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think we have an easy relationship with our technology at the moment,&quot; Ive began, before adding, &quot;When I said we have an uncomfortable relationship with our technology, I mean, that&#x27;s the most obscene understatement.&quot;</p><p>Instead of chasing productivity, the primary goal for this new family of devices is emotional well-being. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the efficiency-obsessed ethos that dominates Silicon Valley.</p><p>When asked about his ambitions for the new devices, Ive prioritized emotional well-being over simple productivity. &quot;I know I should care about productivity, and I do,&quot; he said, but his ultimate goal is that the tools &quot;make us happy and fulfilled, and more peaceful and less anxious, and less disconnected.&quot;</p><p>He framed it as a chance to reject the current, fraught relationship people have with their technology. &quot;We have a chance to... absolutely change the situation that we find ourselves in,&quot; he stated. &quot;We don&#x27;t accept this has to be the norm.&quot;</p><h2>Buried in brilliance: why &#x27;15 to 20 compelling ideas&#x27; have become Ive&#x27;s biggest challenge</h2><p>While the vision is clear, the path is fraught with challenges. Reports have surfaced about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58b078be-e0ab-492f-9dbf-c2fe67298dd3\"><u>technical hurdles and philosophical debates</u></a> delaying the project. Ive himself gave voice to this struggle, admitting the sheer pace of AI&#x27;s progress has been overwhelming. The rapid advancement has generated a torrent of possibilities, making the crucial act of focusing incredibly difficult.</p><p>&quot;The momentum is so extraordinary... it has led us to generate 15 to 20 really compelling product ideas. And the challenge is trying to focus,&quot; Ive confessed.&quot;I used to be good at that, and I&#x27;ve lost some confidence, because the choices are, it&#x27;ll be easy if you really knew there were three good ones... it&#x27;s just not like that.&quot;</p><p>This admission provides context to reports that the team is grappling with unresolved issues around the device&#x27;s &quot;personality&quot; and computing infrastructure. The goal, according to one source, is to create an AI companion that is &quot;accessible but not intrusive,&quot; avoiding the pitfalls of a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58b078be-e0ab-492f-9dbf-c2fe67298dd3\"><u>weird AI girlfriend</u></a>.&quot;</p><h2>Beyond the screen: Ive&#x27;s design philosophy for an &#x27;inevitable&#x27; AI device</h2><p>While no devices were shown, the conversation and prior reports offer clues. The project involves a &quot;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/07/legendary-apple-designer-jony-ive-wants-to-fix-our-relationships-with-technology-openai/\"><u>family of devices</u></a>,&quot; not a single gadget.It will likely be a departure from the screen-centric world we inhabit. Reports suggest a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58b078be-e0ab-492f-9dbf-c2fe67298dd3\"><u>palm-sized device without a screen</u></a>&quot; that relies on cameras and microphones to perceive its environment.</p><p>Ive argued that it would be &quot;absurd&quot; to assume that today&#x27;s breathtaking AI technology should be delivered through &quot;products that are decades old.&quot; The goal is to create something that feels entirely new, yet completely natural.</p><p>&quot;It should seem inevitable. It should seem obvious, as if there wasn&#x27;t possibly another rational solution to the problem,&quot; Ive said, echoing a design philosophy often attributed to his time with Steve Jobs.</p><p>He also spoke of bringing a sense of joy and whimsy back to technology, pushing back against a culture he feels has become overly serious.</p><p>&quot;In terms of the interfaces we design, if we can&#x27;t smile honestly, if it&#x27;s just another deeply serious sort of exclusive thing, I think that would do us all a huge disservice,&quot; he remarked.</p><p>The chat concluded without a product reveal, leaving the audience with a philosophical blueprint rather than a technical one. The central narrative is clear: <a href=\"https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/\"><u>Jony Ive</u></a>, the designer who put a screen in every pocket, is now betting on a screenless future, powered by OpenAI&#x27;s formidable intelligence, to make us all a little less anxious and a little more human.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>technology</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4fLD8mX9t3gwHcGqklFuYh/3bb0d401ff6683290bdda3fb7ba49bd8/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_Jony_Ive_fcebd973-1896-4973-8899-a0a7538cff14.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Samsung AI researcher's new, open reasoning model TRM outperforms models 10,000X larger — on specific problems]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/samsung-ai-researchers-new-open-reasoning-model-trm-outperforms-models-10</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44KxyoTTtipVcm0fgiUHOV</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:32:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>The trend of AI researchers developing new, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/next-big-thing-ai-think-small-models-venturebeat-yyrte/?trackingId=x3X3vTZhTnmwCTUtOWGAug%3D%3D\">small</a> open source generative models that outperform far larger, proprietary peers continued this week with yet another staggering advancement.</p><p><b>Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau</b>, Senior AI Researcher at <b>Samsung&#x27;s Advanced​ Institute of Technology (SAIT)</b> in Montreal, Canada,<b>​ </b>has <a href=\"https://x.com/jm_alexia/status/1975560628657164426\"><b>introduced the Tiny Recursion Model (TRM)</b></a> — a neural network so small it contains just 7 million parameters (internal model settings), yet it competes with or surpasses cutting-edge language models 10,000 times larger in terms of their parameter count, including<b> OpenAI&#x27;s o3-mini and Google&#x27;s Gemini 2.5 Pro,</b> on some of the toughest reasoning benchmarks in AI research. </p><p>The goal is to show that very highly performant new AI models can be created affordably without massive investments in the graphics processing units (GPUs) and power needed to train the larger, multi-trillion parameter flagship models powering many LLM chatbots today. The results were described in a research paper published on open access website arxiv.org, entitled &quot;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871v1\"><i>Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks</i></a>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to solve hard tasks is a trap,&quot; wrote Jolicoeur-Martineau on the <a href=\"https://x.com/jm_alexia/status/1975561300890812793\">social network X</a>. &quot;Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction.&quot;</p><div></div><p>Jolicoeur-Martineau also added: &quot;With recursive reasoning, it turns out that &#x27;less is more&#x27;. <b>A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.&quot;</b></p><p>TRM&#x27;s code is available now on <a href=\"https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels\">Github</a> under an enterprise-friendly, commercially viable MIT License — meaning anyone from researchers to companies can take, modify it, and deploy it for their own purposes, even commercial applications.</p><h3><b>One Big Caveat</b></h3><p>However, readers should be aware that TRM was designed specifically to perform well on structured, visual, grid-based problems like Sudoku, mazes, and puzzles on the <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/arc-agi\">ARC (Abstract and Reasoning Corpus)-AGI benchmark</a>, the latter which offers tasks that should be easy for humans but difficult for AI models, such sorting colors on a grid based on a prior, but not identical, solution. </p><h3><b>From Hierarchy to Simplicity</b></h3><p>The TRM architecture represents a radical simplification. </p><p>It builds upon a technique called <b>Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)</b> introduced earlier this year, which showed that small networks could tackle logical puzzles like Sudoku and mazes. </p><p>HRM relied on two cooperating networks—one operating at high frequency, the other at low—supported by biologically inspired arguments and mathematical justifications involving fixed-point theorems. Jolicoeur-Martineau found this unnecessarily complicated.</p><p>TRM strips these elements away. Instead of two networks, it uses a <b>single two-layer model</b> that recursively refines its own predictions. </p><p>The model begins with an embedded question and an initial answer, represented by variables <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>z</b>. Through a series of reasoning steps, it updates its internal latent representation <b>z</b> and refines the answer <b>y</b> until it converges on a stable output. Each iteration corrects potential errors from the previous step, yielding a self-improving reasoning process without extra hierarchy or mathematical overhead.</p><h3><b>How Recursion Replaces Scale</b></h3><p>The core idea behind TRM is that <i>recursion can substitute for depth and size.</i></p><p>By iteratively reasoning over its own output, the network effectively simulates a much deeper architecture without the associated memory or computational cost. This recursive cycle, run over as many as sixteen supervision steps, allows the model to make progressively better predictions — similar in spirit to how large language models use multi-step “chain-of-thought” reasoning, but achieved here with a compact, feed-forward design.</p><p>The simplicity pays off in both efficiency and generalization. The model uses fewer layers, no fixed-point approximations, and no dual-network hierarchy. A lightweight <b>halting mechanism</b> decides when to stop refining, preventing wasted computation while maintaining accuracy.</p><h3><b>Performance That Punches Above Its Weight</b></h3><p>Despite its small footprint, TRM delivers benchmark results that rival or exceed models millions of times larger. In testing, the model achieved:</p><ul><li><p><b>87.4% accuracy</b> on <b>Sudoku-Extreme</b> (up from 55% for HRM)</p></li><li><p><b>85% accuracy</b> on <b>Maze-Hard</b> puzzles</p></li><li><p><b>45% accuracy</b> on <b>ARC-AGI-1</b></p></li><li><p><b>8% accuracy</b> on <b>ARC-AGI-2</b></p></li></ul><p>These results surpass or closely match performance from several high-end large language models, including <b>DeepSeek R1</b>, <b>Gemini 2.5 Pro</b>, and <b>o3-mini</b>, despite TRM using less than 0.01% of their parameters.</p><p>Such results suggest that recursive reasoning, not scale, may be the key to handling abstract and combinatorial reasoning problems — domains where even top-tier generative models often stumble.</p><h3><b>Design Philosophy: Less Is More</b></h3><p>TRM’s success stems from deliberate minimalism. Jolicoeur-Martineau found that reducing complexity led to better generalization. </p><p>When the researcher increased layer count or model size, performance declined due to overfitting on small datasets. </p><p>By contrast, the two-layer structure, combined with recursive depth and <b>deep supervision</b>, achieved optimal results.</p><p>The model also performed better when self-attention was replaced with a <b>simpler multilayer perceptron</b> on tasks with small, fixed contexts like Sudoku. </p><p>For larger grids, such as ARC puzzles, self-attention remained valuable. These findings underline that model architecture should match data structure and scale rather than default to maximal capacity.</p><h3><b>Training Small, Thinking Big</b></h3><p>TRM is now officially available as <b>open source under an MIT license</b> on <a href=\"https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels\">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The repository includes full training and evaluation scripts, dataset builders for Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI, and reference configurations for reproducing the published results. </p><p>It also documents compute requirements ranging from a single NVIDIA L40S GPU for Sudoku training to multi-GPU H100 setups for ARC-AGI experiments.</p><p>The open release confirms that TRM is designed specifically for <b>structured, grid-based reasoning tasks</b> rather than general-purpose language modeling. </p><p>Each benchmark — Sudoku-Extreme, Maze-Hard, and ARC-AGI — uses small, well-defined input–output grids, aligning with the model’s recursive supervision process. </p><p>Training involves substantial data augmentation (such as color permutations and geometric transformations), underscoring that TRM’s efficiency lies in its parameter size rather than total compute demand.</p><p>The model’s simplicity and transparency make it more accessible to researchers outside of large corporate labs. Its codebase builds directly on the earlier Hierarchical Reasoning Model framework but removes HRM’s biological analogies, multiple network hierarchies, and fixed-point dependencies. </p><p>In doing so, TRM offers a reproducible baseline for exploring recursive reasoning in small models — a counterpoint to the dominant “scale is all you need” philosophy.</p><h3><b>Community Reaction</b></h3><p>The release of TRM and its open-source codebase prompted an immediate debate among AI researchers and practitioners on X. While many praised the achievement, others questioned how broadly its methods could generalize.</p><p>Supporters hailed TRM as proof that small models can outperform giants, calling it “<a href=\"https://x.com/VraserX/status/1975668454763209169\">10,000× smaller yet smarter</a>” and a potential step toward architectures that think rather than merely scale. </p><p>Critics countered that TRM’s domain is narrow — focused on <b>bounded, grid-based puzzles</b> — and that its compute savings come mainly from size, not total runtime. </p><p>Researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/ynmncha/status/1975699469607010731\">Yunmin Cha</a> noted that TRM’s training depends on heavy augmentation and recursive passes, “more compute, same model.” </p><p>Cancer geneticist and data scientist<a href=\"https://x.com/LovedayChey/status/1975907723150590019\"> Chey Loveday</a> stressed that TRM is a <i>solver</i>, not a chat model or text generator: it excels at structured reasoning but not open-ended language.</p><p>Machine learning researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/rasbt/status/1975922614389408022\">Sebastian Raschka</a> positioned TRM as an important simplification of HRM rather than a new form of general intelligence. </p><p>He described its process as “a two-step loop that updates an internal reasoning state, then refines the answer.”</p><p>Several researchers, including <a href=\"https://x.com/augustinabele/status/1975927654353445022\">Augustin Nabele</a>, agreed that the model’s strength lies in its clear reasoning structure but noted that future work would need to show transfer to less-constrained problem types.</p><p>The consensus emerging online is that TRM may be narrow, but its message is broad: careful recursion, not constant expansion, could drive the next wave of reasoning research.</p><h3><b>Looking Ahead</b></h3><p>While TRM currently applies to supervised reasoning tasks, its recursive framework opens several future directions. Jolicoeur-Martineau has suggested exploring <b>generative or multi-answer variants</b>, where the model could produce multiple possible solutions rather than a single deterministic one. </p><p>Another open question involves scaling laws for recursion — determining how far the “less is more” principle can extend as model complexity or data size grows.</p><p>Ultimately, the study offers both a practical tool and a conceptual reminder: progress in AI need not depend on ever-larger models. Sometimes, teaching a small network to think carefully — and recursively — can be more powerful than making a large one think once.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4Y3jccClBvI8kQZ6vIONvV/6e12602d0648cdc7e769b10d531f649e/cfr0z3n_watercolor_evocative_storybook_artwork_of_a_giant_robot_3432736a-32c4-46e0-af0f-9e87b1fd4208.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[AI21’s Jamba reasoning 3B redefines what 'small' means in LLMs — 250K context on a laptop]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai21s-jamba-reasoning-3b-redefines-what-small-means-in-llms-250k-context-on</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">oQCPe46scDHsh38EtDgIh</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest addition to the small model wave for enterprises comes from <a href=\"https://www.ai21.com/\"><u>AI21 Labs</u></a>, which is betting that bringing models to devices will free up traffic in data centers. </p><p>AI21’s Jamba Reasoning 3B, a “tiny” open-source model that can run extended reasoning, code generation and respond based on ground truth. Jamba Reasoning 3B handles more than 250,000 tokens and can run inference on edge devices. </p><p>The company said Jamba Reasoning 3B works on devices such as laptops and mobile phones. </p><p>Ori Goshen, co-CEO of AI21, told VentureBeat that the company sees more enterprise use cases for small models, mainly because moving most inference to devices frees up data centers.  </p><p>“What we&#x27;re seeing right now in the industry is an economics issue where there are very expensive data center build-outs, and the revenue that is generated from the data centers versus the depreciation rate of all their chips shows the math doesn&#x27;t add up,” Goshen said. </p><p>He added that in the future “the industry by and large would be hybrid in the sense that some of the computation will be on devices locally and other inference will move to GPUs.”</p><h2>Tested on a MacBook</h2><p>\nJamba Reasoning 3B combines the Mamba architecture and Transformers to allow it to run a 250K token window on devices. AI21 said it can do 2-4x faster inference speeds. Goshen said the Mamba architecture significantly contributed to the model’s speed. </p><p>Jamba Reasoning 3B’s hybrid architecture also allows it to reduce memory requirements, thereby reducing its computing needs. </p><p>AI21 tested the model on a standard MacBook Pro and found that it can process 35 tokens per second. </p><p>Goshen said the model works best for tasks involving function calling, policy-grounded generation and tool routing. He said that simple requests, such as asking for information about a forthcoming meeting and asking the model to create an agenda for it, could be done on devices. The more complex reasoning tasks can be saved for GPU clusters. </p><h2>Small models in enterprise</h2><p>Enterprises have been interested in using a mix of small models, some of which are specifically designed for their industry and some that are condensed versions of LLMs. </p><p>In September, <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\"><u>Meta</u></a> released <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-new-small-reasoning-model-shows-industry-shift-toward-tiny-ai-for\"><u>MobileLLM-R1, a family of reasoning models</u></a> ranging from 140M to 950M parameters. These models are designed for math, coding and scientific reasoning rather than chat applications. MobileLLM-R1 can run on compute-constrained devices. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><u>Google</u></a>’s <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-open-source-gemma-3-model-with-128k-context-window\"><u>Gemma</u></a> was one of the first small models to come to the market, designed to run on portable devices like laptops and mobile phones. Gemma has since <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-ultra-small-and-efficient-open-source-ai-model-gemma-3-270m-that-can-run-on-smartphones\"><u>been expanded</u></a>. </p><p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.myfico.com/\"><u>FICO</u></a> have also begun building their own models. <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ficos-answer-to-ai-risk-a-foundation-model-that-scores-every-output-for\"><u>FICO launched</u></a> its FICO Focused Language and FICO Focused Sequence small models that will only answer finance-specific questions. </p><p>Goshen said the big difference their model offers is that it’s even smaller than most models and yet it can run reasoning tasks without sacrificing speed. </p><h2>Benchmark testing </h2><p>In benchmark testing, Jamba Reasoning 3B demonstrated strong performance compared to other small models, including <a href=\"https://chat.qwen.ai/\"><u>Qwen</u></a> 4B, <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\"><u>Meta</u></a>’s Llama 3.2B-3B, and Phi-4-Mini from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\"><u>Microsoft</u></a>. </p><p>It outperformed all models on the IFBench test and Humanity’s Last Exam, although it came in second to Qwen 4 on MMLU-Pro. </p><p>Goshen said another advantage of small models like Jamba Reasoning 3B is that they are highly steerable and provide better privacy options to enterprises because the inference is not sent to a server elsewhere. </p><p>“I do believe there’s a world where you can optimize for the needs and the experience of the customer, and the models that will be kept on devices are a large part of it,” he said. </p><p>\n\n\n\n\n</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5oeaGc6bdeKn9zv5ZBduGS/f5fd953849eaf0b642bec868df68b07e/crimedy7_illustration_of_dozens_of_small_robots_working_on_a__4b54aeff-0eaf-4af3-abfa-c8fe2d943247_2.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[OpenAI Dev Day 2025: ChatGPT becomes the new app store — and hardware is coming]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6na0pAdxl9xh4fN39O1ww5</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>In a packed hall at Fort Mason Center in San Francisco, against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> CEO Sam Altman laid out a bold vision to remake the digital world. The company that brought generative AI to the mainstream with a simple chatbot is now building the foundations for its next act: a comprehensive computing platform designed to move beyond the screen and browser, with legendary designer Jony Ive enlisted to help shape its physical form.</p><p>At its <a href=\"https://openai.com/devday/\"><u>third annual DevDay</u></a>, OpenAI unveiled a suite of tools that signals a strategic pivot from a model provider to a full-fledged ecosystem. The message was clear: the era of simply asking an AI questions is over. The future is about commanding AI to perform complex tasks, build software autonomously, and live inside every application, a transition Altman framed as moving from &quot;systems that you can ask anything to, to systems that you can ask to do anything for you.&quot; </p><p>The day’s announcements were a three-pronged assault on the status quo, targeting how users interact with software, how developers build it, and how businesses deploy intelligent agents. But it was the sessions held behind closed doors, away from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/hS1YqcewH0c?si=mFE2rRx3QrK7z6NF\"><u>public livestream</u></a>, that revealed the true scope of OpenAI’s ambition — a future that includes new hardware, a relentless pursuit of computational power, and a philosophical quest to redefine our relationship with technology.</p><h3><b>From chatbot to operating system: The new &#x27;App Store&#x27;</b></h3><p>The centerpiece of the public-facing keynote was the transformation of <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a> itself. With the new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\"><u>Apps SDK</u></a>, OpenAI is turning its wildly popular chatbot into a dynamic, interactive platform, effectively an operating system where developers can build and distribute their own applications.</p><p>“Today, we&#x27;re going to open up ChatGPT for developers to build real apps inside of ChatGPT,” Altman announced during the keynote presentation to applause. “This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with.”</p><p>Live demonstrations showcased apps from partners like <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\"><u>Coursera</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\"><u>Canva</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/\"><u>Zillow</u></a> running seamlessly within a chat conversation. A user could watch a machine learning lecture, ask <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a> to explain a concept in real-time, and then use Canva to generate a poster based on the conversation, all without leaving the chat interface. The apps can render rich, interactive UIs, even going full-screen to offer a complete experience, like exploring a Zillow map of homes.</p><p>For developers, this represents a powerful new distribution channel. “When you build with the Apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of chat users,” Altman said, highlighting a direct path to a massive user base that has grown to over <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-announces-apps-sdk-allowing-chatgpt-to-launch-and-run-third-party\"><u>800 million weekly active users</u></a>. </p><p>In a private press conference later, Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, elaborated on the grander vision. &quot;We never meant to build a chatbot,&quot; he stated. &quot;When we set out to make ChatGPT, we meant to build a super assistant and we got a little sidetracked. And one of the tragedies of getting a little sidetracked is that we built a great chatbot, but we are the first ones to say that not all software needs to be a chatbot, not all interaction with the commercial world needs to be a chatbot.&quot;</p><p>Turley emphasized that while OpenAI is excited about natural language interfaces, &quot;the interface really needs to evolve, which is why you see so much UI in the demos today. In fact, you can even go full screen and chat is in the background.&quot; He described a future where users might &quot;start your day in ChatGPT, just because it kind of has become the de facto entry point into the commercial web and into a lot of software,&quot; but clarified that &quot;our incentive is not to keep you in. Our product is to allow other people to build amazing businesses on top and to evolve the form factor of software.&quot;</p><h3><b>The rise of the agents: Building the &#x27;do anything&#x27; AI</b></h3><p>If apps are about bringing the world into ChatGPT, the new &quot;<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/\"><u>Agent Kit</u></a>&quot; is about sending AI out into the world to get things done. OpenAI is providing a complete &quot;set of building blocks... to help you take agents from prototype to production,&quot; Altman explained in his keynote. </p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/\"><u>Agent Kit</u></a> is an integrated development environment for creating autonomous AI workers. It features a visual canvas to design complex workflows, an embeddable chat interface (&quot;Chat Kit&quot;) for deploying agents in any app, and a sophisticated evaluation suite to measure and improve performance.</p><p>A compelling demo from financial operations platform <a href=\"https://ramp.com/\"><u>Ramp</u></a> showed how Agent Kit was used to build a procurement agent. An employee could simply type, &quot;I need five more ChatGPT business seats,&quot; and the agent would parse the request, check it against company expense policies, find vendor details, and prepare a virtual credit card for the purchase — a process that once took weeks now completed in minutes. </p><p>This push into agents is a direct response to a growing enterprise need to move beyond AI as a simple information retrieval tool and toward AI as a productivity engine that automates complex business processes. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI&#x27;s COO, noted that for enterprise adoption, &quot;you needed this kind of shift to more agentic AI that could actually do things for you, versus just respond with text outputs.&quot; </p><h3><b>The future of code and the Jony Ive bBombshell</b></h3><p>Perhaps the most profound shift is occurring in software development itself. <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/codex-now-generally-available/\"><u>Codex</u></a>, OpenAI&#x27;s AI coding agent, has graduated from a research preview to a full-fledged product, now powered by a specialized version of the new GPT-5 model. It is, as one speaker put it, &quot;a teammate that understands your context.&quot; </p><p>The capabilities are staggering. Developers can now assign <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/codex-now-generally-available/\"><u>Codex</u></a> tasks directly from <a href=\"https://slack.com/\"><u>Slack</u></a>, and the agent can autonomously write code, create pull requests, and even review other engineers&#x27; work on <a href=\"https://github.com/\"><u>GitHub</u></a>. A live demo showed Codex taking a simple photo of a whiteboard sketch and turning it into a fully functional, beautifully designed mobile app screen. Another demo showed an app that could &quot;self-evolve,&quot; reprogramming itself in real-time based on a user&#x27;s natural language request. </p><p>But the day&#x27;s biggest surprise came in a closing fireside chat, which was not livestreamed, between <a href=\"https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/\"><u>Altman and Jony Ive</u></a>, the iconic former chief design officer of Apple. The two revealed they have been collaborating for three years on a new family of AI-centric hardware.</p><p>Ive, whose design philosophy shaped the iPhone, iMac, and Apple Watch, said his creative team’s purpose &quot;became clear&quot; with the launch of ChatGPT. He argued that our current relationship with technology is broken and that AI presents an opportunity for a fundamental reset.</p><p>“I think it would be absurd to assume that you could have technology that is this breathtaking, delivered to us through legacy products, products that are decades old,” Ive said. “I see it as a chance to use this most remarkable capability to full-on address a lot of the overwhelm and despair that people feel right now.”</p><p>While details of the devices remain secret, Ive spoke of his motivation in deeply human terms. “We love our species, and we want to be useful. We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given,” he said. He emphasized the importance of &quot;care&quot; in the design process, stating, &quot;We sense when people have cared... you sense carelessness. You sense when somebody does not care about you, they care about money and schedule.&quot; </p><p>This collaboration confirms that OpenAI&#x27;s ambitions are not confined to the cloud; it is actively exploring the physical interface through which humanity will interact with its powerful new intelligence.</p><h3><b>The Unquenchable Thirst for Compute</b></h3><p>Underpinning this entire platform strategy is a single, overwhelming constraint: the availability of computing power. In both the private press conference and the un-streamed Developer State of the Union, OpenAI’s leadership returned to this theme again and again.</p><p>“The degree to which we are all constrained by compute... Everyone is just so constrained on being able to offer the services at the scale required to get the revenue that at this point, we&#x27;re quite confident we can push it pretty far,” Altman told reporters. He added that even with massive new hardware partnerships with AMD and others, &quot;we&#x27;ll be saying the same thing again. We&#x27;re so convinced... There&#x27;s so much more demand.&quot; </p><p>This explains the company’s aggressive, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/companies-pouring-billions-advance-ai-infrastructure-2025-10-06/\"><u>multi-billion-dollar investment in infrastructure</u></a>. When asked about profitability, Altman was candid that the company is in a phase of &quot;investment and growth.&quot; He invoked a famous quote from Walt Disney, paraphrasing, &quot;We make more money so we can make more movies.&quot; For OpenAI, the &quot;movies&quot; are ever-more-powerful AI models.</p><p>Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s President, put the ultimate goal in stark economic terms during the Developer State of the Union. &quot;AI is going to become, probably in the not too distant future, the fundamental driver of economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;Asking ‘How much compute do you want?’ is a little bit like asking how much workforce do you want? The answer is, you can always get more out of more.&quot; </p><p>As the day concluded and developers mingled at the reception, the scale of OpenAI&#x27;s project came into focus. Fueled by new models like the powerful <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-pro\"><u>GPT-5 Pro</u></a> and the stunning <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\"><u>Sora 2</u></a> video generator, the company is no longer just building AI. It is building the world where AI will live — a world of intelligent apps, autonomous agents, and new physical devices, betting that in the near future, intelligence itself will be the ultimate platform.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Programming &amp; Development</category>\n            <category>Dev</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5SsXpDqbiyZvm7DJbht3pv/765b6ae01f75c4e84f15e6f9f026bdf2/nuneybits_A_developer_working_on_a_retro_computer_on_gradient_b_a06360d7-aa20-4d82-949f-48730f690988.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Google's AI can now surf the web for you, click on buttons, and fill out forms with Gemini 2.5 Computer Use]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-ai-can-now-surf-the-web-for-you-click-on-buttons-and-fill-out-forms</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">16FWPi5oxebzZiw3Q7EeGN</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:20:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of the largest providers of large language models (LLMs) have sought to move beyond multimodal chatbots — extending their models out into &quot;agents&quot; that can actually take more actions on behalf of the user across websites. Recall <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-unveils-chatgpt-agent-that-gives-chatgpt-its-own-computer-to-autonomously-use-your-email-and-web-apps-download-and-create-files-for-you\">OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Agent </a>(formerly known as &quot;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-openais-operator-an-ai-agent-that-uses-the-web-to-book-you-dinner-reservations-order-tickets-compile-grocery-lists-and-more\">Operator</a>&quot;) and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-new-ai-can-use-computers-like-a-human-redefining-automation-for-enterprises\">Anthropic&#x27;s Computer Use</a>, both released over the last two years. </p><p>Now, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant&#x27;s<b> DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM</b> known as &quot;<a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=\">Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use</a>,&quot; which can<b> use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites</b> — all from a user&#x27;s single text prompt.</p><p>&quot;These are early days, but the model’s ability to interact with the web – like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns – is an <b>important next step in building general-purpose agents,&quot; </b>said <b>Google CEO Sundar Pichai,</b> as part of a <a href=\"https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1975668337364590913\">longer statement on the social network, X.</a></p><div></div><p>The model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"https://x.com/browserbasehq/status/1975649022112374913\">Google partnered </a>with another company, <a href=\"https://www.browserbase.com/\">Browserbase</a>, founded by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/T8D9jfNEs9M?si=uaz2eHbvFByP0HBu\">former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024</a>, which offers virtual &quot;headless&quot; web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A &quot;headless&quot; browser is one that doesn&#x27;t require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user). </p><p>Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase <a href=\"https://gemini.browserbase.com/\">here</a> and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new &quot;<a href=\"https://arena.browserbase.com/\">Browser Arena</a>&quot; launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).</p><p>For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM <!-- -->through the <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use\"><b>Gemini API in Google AI Studio</b></a> for <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/ai/gemini?hl=en\">rapid prototyping</a>, and Google Cloud&#x27;s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/computer-use\"><b>Vertex AI</b></a> model selector and applications building platform. </p><p>The new offering builds on the capabilities of<b> Gemini 2.5 Pro</b>, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-releases-most-intelligent-model-to-date-gemini-2-5-pro\">released back in March 2025</a> but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.</p><p>Overall, it appears <!-- -->Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. </p><p>Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.</p><h3><b>Brief User Hands-On Tests</b></h3><p>In my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, &quot;The Life of A Showgirl.&quot;</p><p>In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (&quot;Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.&quot;) It did so in a matter of seconds.</p><p>However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a &quot;task competed&quot; message. </p><p>I should also note here that while the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-unveils-chatgpt-agent-that-gives-chatgpt-its-own-computer-to-autonomously-use-your-email-and-web-apps-download-and-create-files-for-you\">ChatGPT agent from OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-deepens-its-enterprise-push-with-document-generation-taking-the-ai\">Anthropic&#x27;s Claude</a> can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. </p><p>Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.</p><h3><b>Performance Benchmarks</b></h3><p>Google says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use  has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. </p><p>Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.</p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase):</b> 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)</p></li><li><p><b>WebVoyager (Browserbase):</b> 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)</p></li><li><p><b>AndroidWorld (DeepMind):</b> 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of access</p></li><li><p><b>OSWorld:</b> Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%</p></li></ul><p>In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.</p><h3><b>How It Works</b></h3><p>Agents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:</p><ul><li><p>A user task prompt</p></li><li><p>A screenshot of the interface</p></li><li><p>A history of past actions</p></li></ul><p>The model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. </p><p>If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.</p><p>Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.</p><p>The model uses a specialized tool called <code>computer_use</code>, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like <b>Playwright</b> or via the <b>Browserbase</b> demo sandbox.</p><h3><b>Use Cases and Adoption</b></h3><p>According to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:</p><ul><li><p><b>Google’s payments platform team</b> reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.</p></li><li><p><b>Autotab</b>, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.</p></li><li><p><b>Poke.com</b>, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates <b>50% faster</b> than competing solutions during interface interactions.</p></li></ul><p>The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in <b>Project Mariner</b>, the <b>Firebase Testing Agent</b>, and <b>AI Mode in Search</b>.</p><h3><b>Safety Measures</b></h3><p>Because this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:</p><ul><li><p>A <b>per-step safety service</b> inspects every proposed action before execution.</p></li><li><p>Developers can define <b>system-level instructions</b> to block or require confirmation for specific actions.</p></li><li><p>The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.</p></li></ul><p>For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.</p><h3><b>Technical Capabilities</b></h3><p>The model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:</p><ul><li><p><code>click_at</code>, <code>type_text_at</code>, <code>scroll_document</code>, <code>drag_and_drop</code>, and more</p></li><li><p>User-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environments</p></li><li><p>Screen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during execution</p></li></ul><p>It accepts <b>image and text</b> input and outputs <b>text responses</b> or <b>function calls</b> to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is <b>1440x900</b>, though it can work with other sizes.</p><h3><b>API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 Pro</b></h3><p>The pricing for <b>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use</b> aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at <b>$1.25 per one million tokens</b> for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and <b>$2.50 per million tokens</b> for prompts longer than that. </p><p>Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at <b>$10.00 per million</b> for smaller responses and <b>$15.00</b> for larger ones.</p><p>Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. </p><p><b>Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier </b>that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). </p><p>This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.</p><p>In contrast, <b>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier.</b> There is <b>no free access</b> currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.</p><p>Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.</p><p>Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.</p><p>Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5s9EWAUfhOBtT7gJSTJBtI/2fd316df548ef4c0fb40f47c53118ace/cfr0z3n_ultra_minimalist_clean_line_bold_simple_shapes_Google_c_628f064a-d4fe-4c36-9014-3c31c5160b0f__1_.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Has this stealth startup finally cracked the code on enterprise AI agent reliability?

Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people <i>outside of chat</i>. </p><p>Even the<b> best AI models score only in the </b><a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/terminalbench-hard\"><b>30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard,</b></a> a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks <a href=\"https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/taubench_airline\">like TAU-Bench airline,</a> which measures the <b>reliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights</b> on behalf of a user, also don&#x27;t have much higher pass rates, with <b>only 56% for the top performing agents and models</b> (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) — meaning the agent fails nearly half the time. </p><p>New York City-based <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/\"><b>Augmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc.</b></a>, co-founded by <b>Ohad Elhelo</b> and <b>Ori Cohen</b>, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably. </p><p>The company’s new foundation model, called <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/resources/beyond-generative-ai/\"><b>Apollo-1</b></a><b> </b>— which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release — is built on a principle it calls <i>stateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.</i></p><p>It&#x27;s a hybrid architecture championed by even <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/how-o3-and-grok-4-accidentally-vindicated\">LLM skeptics like Gary Marcus</a>, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.</p><p>“Conversational AI is essentially two halves,” said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “The first half — open-ended dialogue — is handled beautifully by LLMs. They’re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there’s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.”</p><p>AUI defines <i>certainty</i> as the difference between an agent that “probably” performs a task and one that almost “always” does. </p><p>For example, on <b>TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate</b>, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/resources/beyond-generative-ai/\">posted on AUI&#x27;s website.</a></p><p>Elhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy. </p><p>“Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”</p><p>AUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/startup-teaching-ai-agents-shop\"><i>The Information</i></a>, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now. </p><h3><b>From Pattern Matching to Predictable Action</b></h3><p>The team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”</p><p>That distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the <i>next action</i> in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a <i>typed symbolic state</i>.</p><p>Cohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”</p><p>Where transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”</p><h3><b>A Foundation Model for Task Execution</b></h3><p>Unlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a <i>foundation model</i> for task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a <b>System Prompt</b>.</p><p>“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”</p><p>Organizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules. </p><p>A food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.</p><h3><b>Eight Years in the Making</b></h3><p>AUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce. </p><p>That work led to a symbolic language capable of separating <i>procedural knowledge</i> — steps, constraints, and flows — from <i>descriptive knowledge</i> like entities and attributes.</p><p>“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”</p><p>From there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.</p><p>Benchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference. </p><p>In AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over <b>90 percent</b> task completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with <b>60 percent</b> for Claude-4. </p><p>It completed <b>83 percent</b> of live booking chats on Google Flights versus <b>22 percent</b> for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and <b>91 percent</b> of retail scenarios on Amazon versus <b>17 percent</b> for Rufus.</p><p>“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”</p><h3><b>A Complement, Not a Competitor</b></h3><p>AUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”</p><p>The model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail. </p><p>AUI has also confirmed a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/google-cloud-partners-with-aui/\"><b>strategic partnership with Google</b></a> and plans for <b>general availability in November 2025</b>, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/request-access/\">becomes available on AUI&#x27;s website form.</a></p><p>Until then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”</p><h3><b>Toward Conversations That Act</b></h3><p>For all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.</p><p>Whether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4P5b8GF6swZD4TbE4YQYeC/d313c89fdbd0abca57787aca76175c61/cfr0z3n_realistic_hyper_detailed_minimalist_sci-fi_splash_page__733c277b-dfb5-4961-b0eb-ce28078a96e6.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[IBM claims 45% productivity gains with Project Bob, its multi-model IDE that orchestrates LLMs with full repository context]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/ibm-claims-45-productivity-gains-with-project-bob-its-multi-model-ide-that</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">63LRc0Rddnz0zN3wYkPGzE</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>For many enterprises, there continue to be barriers to fully adopting and benefiting from agentic AI.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/\"><u>IBM</u></a><u> </u>is betting the blocker isn&#x27;t building AI agents but governing them in production.</p><p>At its TechXchange 2025 conference today, IBM unveiled a series of capabilities designed to bridge the gap: Project Bob, an AI-first IDE that orchestrates multiple LLMs to automate application modernization; AgentOps for real-time agent governance; and the first integration of open-source<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/datastax-acquires-langflow-to-accelerate-enterprise-generative-ai-app-development\"> <u>Langflow</u></a> into<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/agents-are-key-to-enterprise-ai-success-heres-ibms-plan-on-how-to-make-it-happen\"> <u>watsonx Orchestrate</u></a>, IBM&#x27;s platform for deploying and managing AI agents. IBM&#x27;s announcements represent a three-pronged strategy to address interconnected enterprise AI challenges: modernizing legacy code, governing AI agents in production and bridging the prototype-to-production gap..</p><p>The company claims 6,000 internal developers within IBM have used Project Bob, achieving an average productivity gain of 45% and a 22-43% increase in code commits .</p><h2>Project Bob isn&#x27;t another vibe coder, it&#x27;s an enterprise modernization tool</h2><p>There is no shortage of AI-powered coding tools in the market today, including tools like GitHub Copilot and vibe coding tools such as Replit, Cursor, Bolt and Lovable.</p><p>&quot;Project Bob takes a fundamentally different approach from tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor,&quot;  Bruno Aziza, IBM&#x27;s Vice President of Data, AI and Analytics Strategy told VentureBeat.</p><p>Aziza said that Project Bob is enterprise-focused and maintains full-repository context across editing sessions. It automates complex tasks like Java 8 to  more modern version of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to React, Angular or Liberty.</p><p>The architecture orchestrates between Anthropic&#x27;s Claude, Mistral, Meta&#x27;s Llama and IBM&#x27;s recently released<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/western-qwen-ibm-wows-with-granite-4-llm-launch-and-hybrid-mamba-transformer\"> <u>Granite 4 models</u></a><u> </u>through a data-driven model selection approach. The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.</p><p>&quot;It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.</p><p>Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.</p><p>&quot;Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,&quot; he said.</p><h2>Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnership</h2><p>Part of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and Anthropic</p><p>The two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.</p><p>IBM and Anthropic co-created &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5dd174f42e6\"><u>A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers</u></a>,&quot; focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.</p><h2>Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agents</h2><p>In addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the &quot;prototype to production chasm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Today, there&#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,&quot; Aziza said. &quot;Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform<b> </b>by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” </p><p>Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:</p><p><b>Agent lifecycle framework</b>: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.</p><p><b>Integrated AI governance</b>: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.</p><p><b>Enterprise infrastructure</b>: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.</p><p><b>No-code and pro-code options</b>: Langflow is &quot;low-code.&quot; IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.</p><p><b>Pre-built domain agents</b>: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.</p><p><b>Production observability</b>: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.</p><h2>AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governing</h2><p>IBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. </p><p>Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the &quot;brittle scripts&quot; problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. </p><p>AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.</p><p>The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.</p><h2>What this means for enterprises</h2><p>Technical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments.\n\nProject Bob&#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.</p><p>The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.</p><p>For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes<b>.</b> You can build agents quickly with existing tools.

A Global Admin console will be a prerequisite to using this feature.</p></li><li><p>ChatKit enables users to integrate chat-based agents into their user interfaces. </p></li></ul><p>Eventually, OpenAI said it will build a standalone Workflows API and add agent deployment tabs to ChatGPT. </p><p>OpenAI also expanded evaluation for agents, adding capabilities such as datasets with automated graders and annotations, trace grading that runs end-to-end assessments of workflows, automated prompt optimization, and support for third-party agent measurement tools. </p><p>Developers can access some features of AgentKit, but OpenAI is gradually rolling out additional features, such as Agent Builder. Currently, Agent Builder is available in beta, while ChatKit and new evaluation capabilities are generally available. Connector Registry “is beginning its beta rollout to some API and ChatGPT Enterprise and Edu users. </p><p>OpenAI said pricing for AgentKit tools will be included in the standard API model pricing. </p><h2>Agent Builder</h2><p>To clarify, many agents are built using OpenAI’s models; however, enterprises often access GPT-5 through other platforms to create their own agents. However, AgentKit brings enterprises more into its ecosystem, ensuring they don’t need to tap other platforms as often. </p><p>Demonstrated during DevDay, the company stated that Agent Builder is ideal for rapid iteration. It also provides developers with visibility into how the agents are working. </p><p>During the demo, an OpenAI developer made an agent that reads the DevDay agenda and suggests panels to watch. It took her just under eight minutes. </p><p>Other model providers saw the importance of offering developer toolkits to build agents to entice enterprises to use more of their tools. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a> came out with its <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-new-agent-development-kit-lets-enterprises-rapidly-prototype-and-deploy-ai-agents-without-recoding\">Agent Development Kit in April</a>, expanding multi-agent system building “in under 100 lines of code.” <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft</a>, which runs the popular agent framework AutoGen, announced it is bringing agent creation to one place with its new <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-retires-autogen-and-debuts-agent-framework-to-unify-and-govern\">Agent Framework</a>.</p><p>OpenAI customers, such as the fintech company Ramp, stated in a blog post that its teams were able to build a procurement agent in a few hours instead of months. </p><p>“Agent Builder transformed what once took months of complex orchestration, custom code, and manual optimizations into just a couple of hours. The visual canvas keeps product, legal, and engineering on the same page, slashing iteration cycles by 70% and getting an agent live in two sprints rather than two quarters,” Ramp said. </p><p>AgentKit’s Connector Registry would also enable enterprises to manage and maintain data across workspaces, consolidating data sources into a single panel that spans both ChatGPT and the API. It will have pre-built connectors to Dropbox, Google Drive, SharePoint and Microsoft Teams. It also supports third-party MCP servers. </p><p>Another capability of Agent Builder is Guardrails, an open-source safety layer that protects against the leakage of personally identifiable information (PII), jailbreaks, and unintended or malicious behavior.</p><h2>Bringing more chat </h2><p>Since most agentic interactions involve chat, it makes sense to simplify the process for developers to set up chat interfaces and connect them with the agents they’ve just built. </p><p>“Deploying chat UIs for agents can be surprisingly complex—handling streaming responses, managing threads, showing the model thinking and designing engaging in-chat experiences,” OpenAI said. </p><p>The company said ChatKit makes it simple to embed chat agents on platforms and embed these into apps or websites. </p><p>However, some OpenAI competitors have begun thinking beyond the chatbot and want to offer agentic interactions that feel more seamless. Google’s asynchronous coding agent, Jules, has <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-jules-coding-agent-moves-beyond-chat-with-new-command-line-and-api\">introduced a new feature</a> that enables users to interact with the agent through the command-line interface, eliminating the need to open a chat window. </p><h2>Responses </h2><p>The response to AgentKit has mainly been positive, with some developers noting that while it simplifies agent building, it doesn’t mean that everyone can now build agents. </p><p></p><div></div><div></div><p>Several developers view Agent Kit not as a Zapier killer, but rather as a tool that complements the pipeline. </p><div></div><p></p><div></div><p>Zapier debuted a no-code tool for building AI agents and bots,<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/zapier-central-debuts-as-no-code-tool-for-building-enterprise-ai-bots\"> called Zapier Central,</a> in 2024. </p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/3KvTQAKS3QyovxhH9eBHkZ/51b427793c6d5e1cb53a9c033b9c76cf/crimedy7_illustration_of_the_openai_devday_and_announcing_age_a97efe78-4647-4a53-b5f1-b36126ded9c3_2.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[OpenAI announces Apps SDK allowing ChatGPT to launch and run third party apps like Zillow, Canva, Spotify]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-announces-apps-sdk-allowing-chatgpt-to-launch-and-run-third-party</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">lDeJTwqEEtbx7gBeZZyNF</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 18:24:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI&#x27;s annual conference for third-party developers, DevDay, kicked off with a bang today as co-founder and <b>CEO Sam Altman</b><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\"><b> announced a new &quot;Apps SDK,&quot;</b></a><b> or software development kit, that makes it &quot;possible to build apps inside of ChatGPT,&quot;</b> including paid apps, which companies can charge users for using OpenAI&#x27;s <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-debuts-new-chatgpt-buy-button-and-open-source-agentic-commerce\">recently unveiled Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)</a>. </p><p>In other words, instead of launching apps one-by-one on your phone, computer, or on the web — now you can do all that <i>without </i>ever leaving ChatGPT. </p><p>This feature allows the user to log-into their accounts on those external apps and bring all their information back into ChatGPT, and use the apps very similarly to how they already do outside of the chatbot, but now with the ability to ask ChatGPT to perform certain actions, analyze content, or go beyond what each app could offer on its own. </p><p>You can direct Canva to make you slides based on a text description, ask Zillow for home listings in a certain area fitting certain requirements, or ask Coursera about a specific lesson&#x27;s content while dit plays on video, all from within ChatGPT — with many other apps also already offering their own connections (see below).</p><p>&quot;This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with,&quot; Altman said.</p><p>While the Apps SDK is available today in preview, <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk\">OpenAI said</a> it would not begin accepting new apps within ChatGPT or allow them to charge users until &quot;later this year.&quot;</p><p>ChatGPT in-line app access is already rolling out to ChatGPT Free, Plus, Go and Pro users — outside of the European Union only for now — with Business, Enterprise, and Education tiers expected to receive access to the apps later this year.</p><h3><b>Built atop common MCP standard</b></h3><p>Built on <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/mcp-and-the-innovation-paradox-why-open-standards-will-save-ai-from-itself\">the open source standard Model Context Protocol (MCP)</a> introduced by rival Anthropic nearly a year ago, the Apps SDK gives third-party developers working independently or on behalf of enterprises large and small to connect selected data, &quot;trigger actions, and render a fully interactive UI [user interface]&quot; Altman explained during his introductory keynote speech. </p><p>The Apps SDK includes a &quot;talking to apps&quot; feature that allows ChatGPT and the underlying GPT-5 or other &quot;o-series&quot; models piloting it underneath to obtain updated context from the third-party app or service, so the model &quot;always knows about exactly what you&#x27;re user is interacting with,&quot; according to another presenter and OpenAI engineer, Alexi Christakis.</p><p>Developers can build apps that:</p><ul><li><p>appear <b>inline</b> in chat as lightweight cards or carousels</p></li><li><p>expand to <b>fullscreen</b> for immersive tasks like maps, menus, or slides</p></li><li><p>use <b>picture-in-picture</b> for live sessions such as video, games, or quizzes</p></li></ul><p>Each mode is designed to preserve ChatGPT’s minimal, conversational flow while adding interactivity and brand presence.</p><h3><b>Early integrations with Coursera, Canva, Zillow and more...</b></h3><p>Christakis showed off early integrations of<b> external apps built atop the Apps SDK</b>, including ones from e-learning company <b>Coursera</b>, cloud design software company <b>Canva</b>, and real estate listings and agent connections search engine, <b>Zillow</b>.</p><p>Altman also announced Apps SDK integrations with additional partners not demoed officially during the keynote including: <b>Booking.com</b>, <b>Expedia</b>, <b>Figma</b> and <b>Spotify </b>and in documentation, said more upcoming partners are on deck: <b>AllTrails, Peloton, OpenTable, Target, theFork, and Uber</b>, representing lifestyle, commerce, and productivity categories.</p><p>The <b>Coursera demo</b> included an example of how the user onboards to the external app, including a new login screen for the app (Coursera) that appears within the ChatGPT chat interface, activated simply by a text prompt from the user asking: &quot;Coursera can you teach me something about machine learning&quot;?</p><p>Once logged in, the app launched within the chat interface, &quot;in line&quot; and can render anything from the web, including interactive elements like video. </p><p>Christakis explained and showed the Apps SDK also supports &quot;picture-in-picture&quot; and &quot;fullscreen&quot; views, allowing the user to choose how to interact with it.</p><p>When playing a Coursera video that appeared, he showed that it automatically pinned the video to the top of the screen so the user could keep watching it even as they continued to have a back-and-forth dialog in text with ChatGPT in the typical input/output prompts and responses below. </p><p><b>Users can then ask ChatGPT about content appearing in the video without specifying exactly what was said</b>, as the Agents SDK pipes the information on the backend, server-side, from the connected app to the underlying ChatGPT AI model. So &quot;can you explain more about what they&#x27;re saying right now&quot; will automatically surface the relevant portion of the video and provide that to the underlying AI model for it to analyze and respond to through text.</p><p>In another example, Christakis opened an older, existing ChatGPT conversation he&#x27;d had about his siblings&#x27; dog walking business and resumed the conversation by asking another third-party app, <b>Canva</b>, to generate a poster using one of ChatGPT&#x27;s recommended business names, &quot;Walk This Wag,&quot; along with specific guidance about font choice (&quot;sans serif&quot;) and overall coloration and style (&quot;bright and colorful.&quot;)</p><p>Instead of the user manually having to go and add all those specific elements to a Canva template, ChatGPT went and issued the commands and performed the actions on behalf of the user in the background.</p><p>After a few minutes, ChatGPT responded with several poster designs generated directly within the Canva app, but displayed them all in the user&#x27;s ChatGPT chat session where they could see, review, enlarge and provide feedback or ask for adjustments on all of them.</p><p>Christakis then asked for ChatGPT to turn one of the slides into an entire slide deck so the founders of the dog walking business could present it to investors, which did it in the background over several minutes while he presented a final integrated app, <b>Zillow</b>.</p><p>He started a new chat session and asked a simple question: &quot;based on our conversations, what would be a good city to expand the dog walking business.&quot;</p><p>Using ChatGPT&#x27;s optional memory feature, it referenced the dog walk conversation and suggested Pittsburgh, which Christakis used as a chance to type in &quot;Zillow&quot; and &quot;show me some homes for sale there,&quot; which called up an interactive map from Zillow with homes for sale and prices listed and hover-over animations, all in-line within ChatGPT.</p><p>Clicking a specific home also opened a fullscreen view with &quot;most of the Zillow experience,&quot; entirely without leaving ChatGPT, including the ability to request home tours and contact agents and filtering by bedrooms and other qualities like outdoor space. ChatGPT pulls up the requested filtered Zillow search as well as provides a text-based response in-line explaining what it did and why.</p><p>The user can then ask follow-up questions about the specific property — such as &quot;how close is it to a dog park?&quot; — or compare it to other properties, all within ChatGPT.</p><p>It can also use apps in conjunction with its Search function, searching the web to compare the app information (in this case, Zillow) with other sources.</p><h3><b>Safety, privacy, and developer standards</b></h3><p>OpenAI emphasized that <b>apps must comply with strict privacy, safety, and content </b><a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/app-developer-guidelines\"><b>standards</b></a> to be listed in the ChatGPT directory. Apps must:</p><ul><li><p>serve a <b>clear and valuable purpose</b></p></li><li><p>be <b>predictable and reliable</b> in behavior</p></li><li><p>be <b>safe for general audiences</b>, including teens aged 13–17</p></li><li><p><b>respect user privacy</b> and limit data collection to only what’s necessary</p></li></ul><p>Every app must also include a <b>clear, published privacy policy</b>, obtain user consent before connecting, and identify any actions that modify external data (e.g., posting, sending, uploading).</p><p>Apps violating OpenAI’s usage policies, crashing frequently, or misrepresenting their capabilities may be removed at any time. Developers must submit from <b>verified accounts</b>, provide <b>customer support contacts</b>, and maintain their apps for stability and compliance.</p><p>OpenAI also published <b>developer </b><a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk/concepts/design-guidelines\"><b>design guidelines</b></a>, outlining how apps should look, sound, and behave. They must follow ChatGPT’s visual system — including consistent color palettes, typography, spacing, and iconography — and maintain accessibility standards such as alt text and readable contrast ratios.</p><p>Partners can show brand logos and accent colors but not alter ChatGPT’s core interface or use promotional language. Apps should remain <b>“conversational, intelligent, simple, responsive, and accessible,”</b> according to the documentation.</p><h3><b>A new conversational app ecosystem</b></h3><p>By opening ChatGPT to third-party apps and payments, OpenAI is taking a major step toward transforming ChatGPT from a chatbot into a full-fledged <b>AI operating system</b> — one that combines conversational intelligence, rich interfaces, and embedded commerce.</p><p>For developers, that means direct access to <b>over 800 million ChatGPT users</b>, who can discover apps “at the right time” through natural conversation — whether planning trips, learning, or shopping.</p><p>For users, it means <b>a new generation of apps you can chat with</b> — where a single interface helps you book a flight, design a slide deck, or learn a new skill without ever leaving ChatGPT.</p><p>As OpenAI put it: “This is just the start of apps in ChatGPT, bringing new utility to users and new opportunities for developers.”</p><p>There remain a few big questions, namely: 1. what happens to all the data from those third-party apps as they interface with ChatGPT and its users...does OpenAI get access to it and can it train upon it? 2. What happens to OpenAI&#x27;s once much-hyped<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-launches-gpt-store-but-revenue-sharing-is-still-to-come\"> GPT Store,</a> which had been in the past promoted as a way for third-party creators and developers to create custom, task-specific versions of ChatGPT and make money on them through a usage-based revenue share model?</p><p>We&#x27;ve asked the company about both issues and will update when we hear back. </p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Programming &amp; Development</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/7LhLUUL4BbXIc1jxZwCZdI/f7d15d9760b1726ea415ec138ac572c9/openai-apps-sdk.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[From Silicon Valley to Nairobi: What the Global South’s AI leapfrogging teaches tech leaders]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/from-silicon-valley-to-nairobi-what-the-global-souths-ai-leapfrogging</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">36bf4NzjHQd1w5tiB1VW7q</guid>\n            <pubDate>Mon, 06 Oct 2025 07:45:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>When I write about the cognitive migration now underway, brought about by the rapid advance of gen AI, I do so from the perspective of someone who has spent four decades in the technology industry. My own journey runs from coding business applications in Fortran and COBOL to systems analysis and design, IT project management, enterprise systems consulting, computing hardware sales and technology industry communications. All of it has been centered in the U.S., although I have collaborated with colleagues and clients across Europe and Asia.</p><p>My writing carries an American, tech-industry vantage point, although I make attempts to see a broader perspective. Perhaps that is fitting, since much of the frontier development of AI remains clustered in Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and a handful of other Western hubs. But how does this migration look beyond America’s borders? For millions in the <a href=\"https://foreignanalysis.com/what-is-the-global-south/\"><u>Global South</u></a>, cognitive migration is less about the loss of white-collar prestige and more about the chance to leapfrog into new opportunities.</p><p>This divide is visible in the data. The 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer <a href=\"https://www.edelman.com/trust/2025/trust-barometer/report-tech-sector\"><u>found</u></a> that fewer than one in three Americans feel comfortable with businesses using AI, while in India, Indonesia and Nigeria nearly two-thirds express comfort. In the West, AI may be perceived to threaten job loss and displacement, and this view may be warranted. A <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/SDN/2024/English/SDNEA2024001.ashx?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><u>study</u></a> by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that 60% of jobs in advanced economies are exposed to the impact of AI due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-white-collar-job-loss-b9856259?st=ZtwstJ&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top\"><u>quoted</u></a> Ford CEO Jim Farley: “AI will leave a lot of white-collar people behind.”</p><p>In the Global South, however, AI is often perceived as an opportunity to improve education, strengthen healthcare, modernize agriculture and drive development. One analysis <a href=\"https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2025/04/13/why-the-global-south-trusts-ai-and-what-the-world-can-learn-from-it/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><u>argues</u></a> that for the Global South, “AI holds tangible promise for nations historically excluded from the benefits of previous industrial revolutions.” Perhaps this explains the findings <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/126229892/Global_news_media_coverage_of_artificial_intelligence_AI_A_comparative_analysis_of_frames_sentiments_and_trends_across_12_countries\"><u>reported</u></a> by Academia.edu that Global North newspapers publish more negative AI headlines, while Global South outlets emphasize opportunity. </p><p>Yet the story is not so simple. Even where the potential for advancement is emphasized, there is often also worry about loss of work, ethics, algorithmic bias, access and technical capacity. As with earlier waves of globalization, gains and risks will be distributed unevenly.</p><h2>AI as opportunity</h2><p>There is a strong positive narrative around AI in the Global South, with many hopeful stories and promising results. In Nigeria, a World Bank-funded <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/From-chalkboards-to-chatbots-Transforming-learning-in-Nigeria\"><u>after-school tutoring program</u></a> that used AI to tailor lessons to individual students produced striking results with nearly two years of learning gains in just six weeks. For communities with few qualified teachers, such gains are not incremental improvements. They can transform futures. </p><p>Healthcare applications provide comparable stories. In India, Boston Consulting Group <a href=\"https://web-assets.bcg.com/5e/2c/2eb053c141ed93a3d46ac0e00e59/unlocking-the-potential-of-ai-in-india.pdf\"><u>reports</u></a> that AI diagnostic tools are being deployed in rural clinics with few doctors, offering screenings for conditions such as breast cancer or tuberculosis that might otherwise go undetected. These tools extend the reach of limited health resources and help detect conditions before it is too late.</p><p>The use of AI in agriculture also shows promise. In Kenya, the PlantVillage Nuru app <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-state-university-developed-an-ai-assistant-for-african-farmers-2022-8\"><u>developed with Penn State</u></a> University uses AI to <a href=\"https://iafrica.com/plantvillage-ai-for-crop-disease-detection-in-kenya/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><u>detect</u></a> crop diseases through farmers’ smartphones, equipping them to spot and treat threats to their harvests early. For households that depend on subsistence farming, such tools can mean the difference between security and scarcity.</p><p>Yet many of these breakthroughs rely on Northern institutions, creating benefits but also exposing a fragile dependency. When outside funding or partnerships end, local efforts can stall. In this sense, leapfrogging risks being built on borrowed foundations.</p><p>Taken together, these examples illustrate why many in the Global South see AI as a chance to transform trajectories rather than repeat old patterns. Yet optimism tells only part of the story. Alongside these gains are deep structural challenges that complicate the journey, reminding us that this migration, like all others, carries benefits that include hidden costs.</p><h2>Barriers to progress</h2><p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-73639-1_1?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"><u>Research</u></a> also shows that AI adoption across the Global South is hindered by persistent gaps in infrastructure, data, skills and governance. Availability of reliable electricity and broadband remains uneven, local datasets are often scarce or biased and many countries face shortages of trained professionals to develop and oversee AI systems. </p><p>Without strong regulatory frameworks, societies are also more exposed to privacy risks, exploitative labor practices and algorithmic bias. These realities mean that while AI holds promise as a development pathway, it can also deepen inequality if its benefits concentrate in urban centers and among elites, while leaving rural communities behind.</p><p>So why do surveys of trust show higher comfort with AI in the Global South than in the West? One explanation lies in expectations. In the U.S. and Europe, AI is often perceived as a threat to stable jobs and established professions. In Nigeria, India or Indonesia, by contrast, it is more likely to be framed as a tool for closing persistent gaps. </p><p>Media narratives often reinforce the divergence in expectations. In the West, headlines emphasize automation anxiety, while in the Global South, AI is more often described as a development pathway. Add to this the fact that many people in the Global South report higher levels of trust in institutions overall, and the disparity begins to make sense. </p><p>The same technology intersects with different baselines, diverse needs, distinct cultures and different stories, which shape whether AI is welcomed with suspicion or with hope. Yet beyond these perceptual differences lie material realities that complicate the optimistic narrative, particularly in how global AI development distributes both its benefits and its burdens.</p><h2>Hidden costs</h2><p>Every migration carries costs alongside gains, and the story of AI in the Global South is no different. While the overall AI narrative in the Global South leans positive, many celebrated breakthroughs depend on large workforces doing essential yet hidden tasks. Data annotation and content review are indispensable to the global AI economy, but the work is repetitive, emotionally taxing and poorly paid relative to the value it creates.</p><p>Other sectors face pressure from a different direction. In India and the Philippines, business process outsourcing and call centers employ millions of workers who support global clients. These roles depend on language, routine cognitive tasks and customer service, the very areas where AI chatbots and automated platforms are advancing fastest.</p><p>The shift is not immediate, but workers in these industries are already questioning whether the migration now underway will carry them forward or leave them behind. Is cognitive migration a single global phenomenon, or are we witnessing multiple migrations that only appear connected?</p><h2>Many routes, shared destination</h2><p>Is this the same cognitive migration unfolding everywhere, or are there separate journeys? On the surface, the story looks divided. In the U.S. and Europe, professionals worry about displacement from stable careers and a risk to their lifestyles. In India, Nigeria and Indonesia, AI is often presented as a chance to accelerate development and fill long-standing gaps. These appear to be distinct migrations.</p><p>Yet, the reality is more entangled. The story of AI in the Global South is not simply one of catching up, just as the story in the West is not simply one of decline. Migration is never only progress or only loss. It is both, with something gained and something given up. For teachers in Nigeria, the gain may be students advancing at unprecedented speed. For call center workers in India, the loss may be jobs once thought secure. For farmers in Kenya, the gain may be healthier crops and steadier harvests. For professionals in Europe or the United States, the loss may be careers reshaped or diminished by automation.</p><p>This variability in experience is not because AI technology is somehow different in one area or another, but because the lived experiences are diverse. The same systems can seem empowering in one place and threatening in another. </p><h2><b>An uneven passage</b></h2><p>What lies ahead is still uncertain. But if migration teaches anything, it is that adaptation requires not only resilience but imagination. The task is not to deny what is lost or to celebrate only what is gained, but to recognize both and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/stop-drifting-through-ai-transformation-the-design-principles-that-actually\"><u>design wisely</u></a> for what comes next.</p><p>This migration is not unfolding along a single path. It is fractured and revealing. The starting points differ, the routes are uneven, and the burdens are not equally shared. In the Global South, AI is often seen as a lever for progress, not a threat to status. But beneath the promise lie the same risks we face everywhere, including extraction without investment, automation without inclusion, innovation without safeguards and deployment without trust. These are not side effects. They are signals.

The narrative is seductive: AI tools that can write entire applications, streamline engineering teams and reduce the need for expensive human developers, along with hundreds of other jobs. </p><p>But from my point of view as a technologist who spends every day inside real companies’ data and workflows, the hype doesn’t match up with the reality. </p><p>I’ve worked with industry leaders like General Electric, The Walt Disney Company and Harvard Medical School to optimize their data and AI infrastructure, and here’s what I’ve learned: <b>Replacing humans with AI in most jobs is still just an idea on the horizon. </b></p><p>I worry that we&#x27;re thinking too far ahead. In the past two years,<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/14/programming-jobs-lost-artificial-intelligence/\"> <u>more than a quarter</u></a> of programming jobs have vanished. Mark Zuckerberg<a href=\"https://www.inc.com/kit-eaton/mark-zuckerberg-plans-to-replace-some-coders-with-ai-which-might-prove-tricky/91140118\"> <u>announced</u></a> he is planning to replace many of Meta’s coders with AI. </p><p>But, intriguingly, both Bill Gates and Sam Altman have<a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/sam-altman-ai-will-make-coders-10x-more-productive-not-replace-them\"> <u>publicly warned</u></a> against replacing coders. </p><p>Right now, we shouldn’t count on <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-von-neumann-toward-a-unified-deterministic-architecture\">AI tools</a> to successfully replace jobs in tech or business. That’s because what AI knows is inherently limited by what it has seen – and most of what it has seen in the tech world is boilerplate.</p><p>Generative AI models are trained on large datasets, which typically fall into two main categories: publicly available data (from the open internet), or proprietary or licensed data (created in-house by the organization, or purchased from third parties). </p><p>Simple tasks, like building a basic website or configuring a template app, are easy wins for generative models. But when it comes to writing the sophisticated, proprietary infrastructure code that powers companies like Google or Stripe, there’s a problem: That code doesn’t exist in public repositories. It’s locked away inside the walls of corporations, inaccessible to training data and often written by engineers with decades of experience.</p><p>Right now, AI<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/new-apple-study-challenges-whether-ai-models-truly-reason-through-problems/\"> <u>can’t reason</u></a> on its own yet. And it doesn’t have instincts. It’s just mimicking patterns. A friend of mine in the tech world once described large language models (LLMs) as a &quot;really good guesser.&quot; </p><p>Think of AI today as a junior team member — helpful for a first draft or simple projects. But like any junior, it requires oversight. In programming, for example, while I’ve found a 5X improvement for simple coding, I’ve found that reviewing and correcting more complicated AI-produced code often takes more time and energy than writing the code myself. </p><p>You still need senior professionals with deep experience to find the flaws, and to understand the nuances of how those flaws might pose a risk six months from now. </p><p>That’s not to say AI shouldn’t have a place in the workplace. But the dream of replacing entire teams of programmers or accountants or marketers with one human and a host of AI tools is far premature. We still need senior-level people in these jobs, and we need to train people in junior-level jobs to be technically capable enough to assume the more complex roles one day. </p><p>The goal of AI in tech and business shouldn’t be about removing humans from the loop. I’m not saying this because I’m scared AI will take my job. I’m saying it because I’ve seen how dangerous <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/stop-drifting-through-ai-transformation-the-design-principles-that-actually\">trusting AI too much</a> at this stage can be. </p><p>Business leaders, no matter what industry they’re in, should be aware: While AI promises cost savings and smaller teams, these efficiency gains could backfire. You might trust AI to perform more junior levels of work, but not to complete more sophisticated projects. </p><p>AI is fast. Humans are smart. There’s a big difference. The sooner we shift the conversation from replacing humans to reinforcing them, the more we’ll reap the benefits of AI. </p><p><i>Derek Chang is founding partner of</i><a href=\"https://stratusdata.io/\"><i> </i><i><u>Stratus Data</u></i></a><i>.  </i></p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>DataDecisionMakers</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4Glss6wFaZ4by6Tf3rOX9S/262f49bd913d24e09837c14557fa3016/u7277289442_Sophsticated_AI_bots_sit_alongside_humans_at_mode_c6808a94-8ddf-4f76-8761-a77d9b192a0f_3.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Beyond Von Neumann: Toward a unified deterministic architecture]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/beyond-von-neumann-toward-a-unified-deterministic-architecture</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4JVf6RkUbv49R7XnOJ3rHL</guid>\n            <pubDate>Sat, 04 Oct 2025 22:45:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><i>A cycle-accurate alternative to speculation — unifying scalar, vector and matrix compute</i></p><p>For more than half a century, computing has relied on the <a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/von-neumann\">Von Neumann</a> or Harvard model. Nearly every modern chip — CPUs, GPUs and even many specialized accelerators — derives from this design. Over time, new architectures like <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-organization-architecture/very-long-instruction-word-vliw-architecture/\">Very Long Instruction Word</a> (VLIW), dataflow processors and GPUs were introduced to address specific performance bottlenecks, but none offered a comprehensive alternative to the paradigm itself.\n\nA new approach called <a href=\"http://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece742/S20/slides/Deterministic%20Execution.pdf\">Deterministic Execution</a> challenges this status quo. Instead of dynamically guessing what instructions to run next, it schedules every operation with cycle-level precision, creating a predictable execution timeline. This enables a single processor to unify scalar, vector and matrix compute — handling both general-purpose and AI-intensive workloads without relying on separate accelerators.</p><h2>The end of guesswork</h2><p>In dynamic execution, processors speculate about future instructions, dispatch work out of order and roll back when predictions are wrong. This adds complexity, wastes power and can expose security vulnerabilities. Deterministic Execution eliminates speculation entirely. Each instruction has a fixed time slot and resource allocation, ensuring it is issued at exactly the right cycle.\n\nThe mechanism behind this is a time-resource matrix: A scheduling framework that orchestrates compute, memory and control resources across time. Much like a train timetable, scalar, vector and matrix operations move across a synchronized compute fabric without pipeline stalls or contention.</p><h2>Why it matters for enterprise AI</h2><p>\n<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that\">Enterprise AI workloads</a> are pushing existing architectures to their limits. GPUs deliver massive throughput but consume enormous power and struggle with memory bottlenecks. CPUs offer flexibility but lack the parallelism needed for modern inference and training. Multi-chip solutions often introduce latency, synchronization issues and software fragmentation.\n\nIn large AI workloads, datasets often cannot fit into caches, and the processor must pull them directly from DRAM or HBM. Accesses can take hundreds of cycles, leaving functional units idle and burning energy. Traditional pipelines stall on every dependency, magnifying the performance gap between theoretical and delivered throughput.\n\nDeterministic Execution addresses these challenges in three important ways. First, it provides a unified architecture in which general-purpose processing and AI acceleration coexist on a single chip, eliminating the overhead of switching between units. Second, it delivers predictable performance through cycle-accurate execution, making it ideal for latency-sensitive applications such as <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-brian-eno-anticipated-the-creative-dynamics-of-ai-by-decades\">large langauge model</a> (LLM) inference, fraud detection and industrial automation. Finally, it reduces power consumption and physical footprint by simplifying control logic, which in turn translates to a smaller die area and lower energy use.\n\nBy predicting exactly when data will arrive — whether in 10 cycles or 200 — Deterministic Execution can slot dependent instructions into the right future cycle. This turns latency from a hazard into a schedulable event, keeping the execution units fully utilized and avoiding the massive thread and buffer overheads used by GPUs or custom VLIW chips. In modeled workloads, this unified design delivers sustained throughput on par with accelerator-class hardware while running general-purpose code, enabling a single processor to fulfill roles typically split between a CPU and a GPU.\n\nFor <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/neither-driver-nor-passenger-covenantal-co-creator\">LLM deployment teams</a>, this means inference servers can be tuned with precise performance guarantees. For data infrastructure managers, it offers a single compute target that scales from edge devices to cloud racks without major software rewrites.</p><p><i>Comparison of traditional Von Neumann architecture and unified deterministic execution. Image created by author.</i></p><h2>Key architectural innovations</h2><p>\nDeterministic Execution builds on several enabling techniques. The time-resource matrix orchestrates compute and memory resources in fixed time slots. Phantom registers allow pipelining beyond the limits of the physical register file. Vector data buffers and extended vector register sets make it possible to scale parallel processing for AI operations. Instruction replay buffers manage variable-latency events predictably, without relying on speculation.\n\nThe architecture’s dual-banked register file doubles read/write capacity without the penalty of more ports. Direct queuing from DRAM into the vector load/store buffer halves memory accesses and removes the need for multi-megabyte SRAM buffers — cutting silicon area, cost and power.\n\nIn modeled AI and DSP kernels, conventional designs issue a load, wait for it to return, then proceed — causing the entire pipeline to idle. Deterministic Execution pipelines loads and dependent computations in parallel, allowing the same loop to run without interruption, cutting both execution time and joules per operation.\n\nTogether, these innovations create a compute engine that combines the flexibility of a CPU with the sustained throughput of an accelerator, without requiring two separate chips.</p><h2>Implications beyond AI</h2><p>\nWhile AI workloads are an obvious beneficiary, Deterministic Execution has broad implications for other domains. Safety-critical systems — such as those in automotive, aerospace and medical devices — can benefit from deterministic timing guarantees. Real-time analytics systems in finance and operations gain the ability to operate without jitter. Edge computing platforms, where every watt of power matters, can operate more efficiently.\n\nBy eliminating guesswork and enforcing predictable timing, systems built on this approach become easier to verify, more secure and more energy-efficient.</p><h2>Enterprise impact</h2><p>\nFor enterprises deploying AI at scale, architectural efficiency translates directly into competitive advantage. Predictable, latency-free execution simplifies capacity planning for LLM inference clusters, ensuring consistent response times even under peak loads. Lower power consumption and reduced silicon footprint cut operational expenses, especially in large data centers where cooling and energy costs dominate budgets. In edge environments, the ability to run diverse workloads on one chip reduces hardware SKUs, shortens deployment timelines and minimizes maintenance complexity.</p><h2>A path forward for enterprise computing</h2><p>\nThe shift to Deterministic Execution is not merely about raw performance; it represents a return to architectural simplicity, where one chip can serve multiple roles without compromise. As AI permeates every sector, from manufacturing to cybersecurity, the ability to run diverse workloads predictably on a single architecture will be a strategic advantage.\n\nEnterprises evaluating infrastructure for the next five to 10 years should watch this development closely. Deterministic Execution has the potential to reduce hardware complexity, cut power costs and simplify software deployment — while enabling consistent performance across a wide range of applications.\n\n<i>Thang Minh Tran is a microprocessor architect and inventor of more than 180 patents in CPU and accelerator design.</i></p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>DataDecisionMakers</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/3bkwQCfgtVlF5LCElbdzV5/72fbc990936ea3fc16a845dd2d996318/u7277289442_A_crisp_mondern_rendering_of_a_modern_data_center_e5585915-de97-45e3-8104-8c06b60009a4_1.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Huawei's new open source technique shrinks LLMs to make them run on less powerful, less expensive hardware]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/huaweis-new-open-source-technique-shrinks-llms-to-make-them-run-on-less</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">29hGXqRAfjPzkAozRrYi1t</guid>\n            <pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 21:37:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Huawei’s Computing Systems Lab in Zurich has introduced a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22944\">new open-source quantization method </a>for large language models (LLMs) aimed at reducing memory demands without sacrificing output quality. </p><p>The technique, called <b>SINQ (Sinkhorn-Normalized Quantization)</b>, is designed to be fast, calibration-free, and easy to integrate into existing model workflows. The code for performing it has been made available by the Huawei research team on <a href=\"https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ/blob/main/README.md\">Github</a> and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.22944\">Hugging Face</a> under a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, allowing organizations to take and use it, modify it, and deploy it commercially — all for free.</p><p>Across models of different sizes, SINQ cuts memory usage by <b>60–70%</b>, depending on architecture and bit-width. </p><p>This enables models that would previously require &gt;60 GB of memory to run on <b>~20 GB setups</b>—a critical enabler for running large models on a single high-end GPU or even multi-GPU consumer-grade setups.</p><p>This makes it possible to run models that previously needed high-end enterprise GPUs—like NVIDIA’s A100 or H100—on significantly more affordable hardware, such as a single <b>Nvidia GeForce</b> <b>RTX 4090</b> (<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/40-series/rtx-4090/\">around $1600</a>), instead of enterprise hardware like the <b>A100 80GB</b> (<a href=\"https://www.hyperscalers.com/Nvidia-Ampere-A100-80GB-PCIe-Tensor-Core-worlds-fastest-AI-deep-learning-machine-learning-GP-GPU-TESLA-hyperscalers\">$19,000</a>) or even <b>H100</b> units that <a href=\"https://www.asacomputers.com/nvidia-h100-80gb-nvh100tcgpu-gpu-card.html#:~:text=NVIDIA%20H100%2080GB%20GPU%20%2D%20Our%20Price%20%2430%2C970.79\">exceed $30,000</a>.</p><p>For teams using cloud infrastructure, the savings are similarly tangible. A100-based instances often cost $3–4.50 per hour, while 24 GB GPUs like the RTX 4090 are available on many platforms for $1–1.50 per hour. </p><p>Over time, especially for extended inference workloads, this difference can add up to <b>thousands of dollars in cost reductions</b>, while also unlocking LLM deployment on smaller clusters, local workstations, or consumer-grade setups previously constrained by memory.</p><h3><b>Tackling the Memory Challenge of LLMs</b></h3><p>Running large models often requires compromises between performance and size. </p><p>In practice, neural networks use <b>floating-point numbers</b> to represent both weights and activations. A floating-point number can express a wide range of values (very small, very large, with fractional parts).</p><p>This flexibility is helpful because during training and inference, weights and activations can vary in scale dramatically. Using floating-point lets the model adjust precisely. (For example, a weight could be 0.0023 or 123.45, and floating-point can capture both with decent precision.)</p><p>Quantization — a method that reduces the precision of model weights — offers a practical path to lower memory usage, but typically comes with trade-offs in model quality, especially at 4-bit precision and below.</p><p>When you convert those floating-point values into lower-precision formats (like 8-bit integers), you’re approximating them. </p><p>That means you store and compute with fewer bits, which is faster and more memory-efficient — but you risk losing fidelity (i.e. introducing small errors). </p><p>The trick is to do the conversion carefully so the model’s behavior stays nearly the same, even though internally it’s working with rougher approximations of those weights and activations.</p><p>SINQ addresses these pain points by introducing a plug-and-play solution that delivers strong performance even in low-precision settings—without requiring calibration data or inter-layer dependencies.</p><h3><b>How SINQ Works</b></h3><p>The SINQ approach introduces two main innovations:</p><ol><li><p><b>Dual-Axis Scaling:</b> Instead of using a single scale factor for quantizing a matrix, SINQ uses separate scaling vectors for rows and columns. This helps mitigate the effects of outliers and allows the quantization error to be distributed more flexibly across the matrix.</p></li><li><p><b>Sinkhorn-Knopp-Style Normalization:</b> A fast algorithm inspired by Sinkhorn iterations is used to normalize the standard deviations of rows and columns in a matrix. This helps minimize what the authors call “matrix imbalance,” a new proxy metric shown to be more effective than alternatives like kurtosis for improving quantization performance.</p></li></ol><p>The combination of these two features allows SINQ to outperform other calibration-free techniques such as Round-To-Nearest (RTN), HQQ, and Hadamard-based quantization across multiple benchmarks.</p><h3><b>Performance and Compatibility</b></h3><p>SINQ has been evaluated across a wide range of architectures and models, including the Qwen3 series, LLaMA, and DeepSeek. </p><p>On benchmarks like WikiText2 and C4, SINQ consistently reduces perplexity and flip rates compared to baseline methods, often approaching or matching the performance of calibrated solutions.</p><p>It also supports non-uniform quantization schemes such as NF4 and can be combined with calibration methods like AWQ, leading to the variant A-SINQ. In calibrated settings, A-SINQ further narrows the gap with full-precision models.</p><p>In terms of runtime efficiency, SINQ quantizes models roughly twice as fast as HQQ and over 30 times faster than AWQ. This makes it well-suited for both research and production environments where quantization time is a practical constraint.</p><h3><b>Open Source and Easy to Use</b></h3><p>Huawei has released SINQ as an open-source project under a permissive, enterprise-friendly Apache 2.0 license, with implementation instructions and reproducibility tools available on GitHub:</p><p>The repository includes support for quantizing Hugging Face models with just a few lines of code, as well as tools for saving and reloading quantized weights. Default settings offer a balance between memory savings and accuracy, and users can customize parameters like bit-width, tiling strategy, and group size based on their needs.</p><p>The authors also provide evaluation integration via the <code>lm-eval</code> library and plan to release pre-quantized models on the Hugging Face Hub in the near future.</p><h3><b>Looking Ahead</b></h3><p>With growing demand for running large models on consumer-grade hardware, quantization is becoming an essential tool. SINQ aims to lower the entry barrier for LLM deployment, enabling developers and researchers to efficiently shrink models without major trade-offs in quality or compatibility.</p><p>Further updates—including integration with Hugging Face Transformers and pre-quantized model releases—are planned, making this a project to watch in the quantization space.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/1NXwP6yN9J9SMBakmd6NZO/ce14c28923a79bbbe5ed63a39e3de600/cfr0z3n_vector_art_line_art_colorful_abstract_impressionist_c_dedcd214-798e-44a7-a7c7-292cf07eccd0_1.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[OpenAI's DevDay 2025 preview: Will Sam Altman launch the ChatGPT browser?]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openais-devday-2025-preview-will-sam-altman-launch-the-chatgpt-browser</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4hlJDbxEwljBMDhPKiUhiq</guid>\n            <pubDate>Fri, 03 Oct 2025 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> will host more than 1,500 developers at its largest annual conference on Monday, as the company behind ChatGPT seeks to maintain its edge in an increasingly competitive artificial intelligence landscape.</p><p>The third annual <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/announcing-devday-2025/\"><u>DevDay conference</u></a> at San Francisco&#x27;s Fort Mason represents a critical moment for OpenAI, which has seen its dominance challenged by rapid advances from Google&#x27;s <a href=\"https://gemini.google.com/app\"><u>Gemini</u></a>, Anthropic&#x27;s <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\"><u>Claude</u></a>, and Meta&#x27;s growing AI efforts.

The researchers argue that this approach leads to increasingly complex training pipelines and substantial resource requirements. Moreover, in many areas, data is not abundant, hard to obtain, and very expensive to curate.</p><p>However, research in other domains suggests that you don’t necessarily require more data to achieve training objectives in LLM training. </p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206\"><u>LIMA</u></a>, a 2023 paper, showed a model could be effectively aligned with just 1,000 curated examples. More recently, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/researchers-find-you-dont-need-a-ton-of-data-to-train-llms-for-reasoning-tasks\"><u>LIMO</u></a> demonstrated that complex mathematical reasoning could emerge from only 817 training samples. </p><p>With LIMI, the researchers sought to apply the same “less is more” principle to the complex world of AI agents.</p><h2>How LIMI works</h2><p>The LIMI framework demonstrates that sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Key to the framework is a pipeline for collecting high-quality demonstrations of agentic tasks. </p><p>Each demonstration consists of two parts: a query and a trajectory. A query is a natural language request from a user, such as a software development requirement or a scientific research goal. </p><p>The trajectory is the series of steps the AI takes to address the query, including its internal reasoning, its calls to external tools like a code interpreter, and the observations it receives from the environment. For example, a query might be &quot;build a simple chat application,&quot; and the trajectory would include the agent’s internal reasoning and action plan, the code it writes and executes, and the resulting output or errors. </p><p>The trajectory could include multiple iterations of planning, execution, and reflection until it achieves the desired objective.</p><p>To build their dataset, the researchers started with 60 queries from real-world scenarios faced by professional developers and researchers. They then expanded this pool by using <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-launches-gpt-5-not-agi-but-capable-of-generating-software-on-demand\"><u>GPT-5</u></a> to synthesize additional queries from GitHub Pull Requests. </p><p>They employed a team of four computer science PhD students to vet the quality of these queries and choose 18 examples to create a high-quality set of 78 queries focused on software development and research workflows.</p><p>To generate the trajectories, the same PhD students collaborated with a CLI coding agent powered by GPT-5 to complete the 78 tasks. </p><p>They followed an iterative process, collecting the entire interaction sequence until each task was successfully completed, capturing the full arc of realistic human-AI collaboration, including back-and-forth communication and iterative refinement. For the more complex queries, the collected trajectories could extend to more than 152,000 tokens.</p><p>“This approach guarantees that our models learn not only from successful outcomes but also from the complete problem-solving process, including how to adapt strategies and recover from failures during collaborative execution,” the researchers write.</p><h2>LIMI in action</h2><p>To test their framework, the team evaluated models on <a href=\"https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench\"><u>AgencyBench</u></a>, a benchmark designed for measuring agentic skills, as well as other established benchmarks for tool use and coding. </p><p>They fine-tuned <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/chinese-startup-z-ai-launches-powerful-open-source-glm-4-5-model-family-with-powerpoint-creation\"><u>GLM-4.5</u></a>, a powerful open-source model, using their 78-sample dataset and compared its performance against several frontier models, including the base GLM-4.5, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/moonshot-ais-kimi-k2-outperforms-gpt-4-in-key-benchmarks-and-its-free\"><u>Kimi-K2-Instruct</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepseek-v3-1-just-dropped-and-it-might-be-the-most-powerful-open-ai-yet\"><u>DeepSeek-V3.1</u></a>. The LIMI-trained model achieved an average score of 73.5% on AgencyBench, significantly outperforming all baseline models, the best of which (GLM-4.5) scored 45.1%. </p><p>This superiority extended to other benchmarks covering tool use, coding, and scientific computing, where LIMI also outperformed all baselines.</p><p>More importantly, the study showed that the model trained on just 78 examples outperformed models trained with 10,000 samples from another dataset, delivering <b>superior performance with 128 times less data.</b> </p><p>“This discovery fundamentally reshapes how we develop autonomous AI systems, suggesting that mastering agency requires understanding its essence, not scaling training data,” the researchers write. “As industries transition from thinking AI to working AI, LIMI provides a paradigm for sustainable cultivation of truly agentic intelligence.”</p><p>The researchers have released <a href=\"https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/LIMI\"><u>the code</u></a> for the data synthesis and training and <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/GAIR/LIMI\"><u>model weights</u></a>. For the enterprise, this approach offers a practical path toward developing highly specialized AI agents. </p><p>Instead of undertaking massive data collection projects, organizations can leverage their in-house talent and subject matter experts to create small, high-quality datasets for bespoke agentic tasks. This lowers the barrier to entry and enables businesses to build custom AI agents that can provide a competitive edge on the workflows that matter most to them.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>bendee983@gmail.com (Ben Dickson)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5lyJOdzuNimDo7RSn17UjD/093feca9d494e7fd232cc9a7bae79943/robot_choosing_training_examples.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpg\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Google's Jules coding agent moves beyond chat with new command line and API]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-jules-coding-agent-moves-beyond-chat-with-new-command-line-and-api</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">2GzPEudasc8zAkeZYk4kjx</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><u>Google</u></a> wants its coding assistant, Jules, to be far more integrated into developers’ terminals than ever. The company wants to make it a more workflow-native tool, hoping that more people will use it beyond the chat interface. </p><p>Jules, which the company first announced<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-ai-coding-assistant-jules-promising-autonomous-bug-fixes-and-faster-development-cycles\"><u> in December 2024</u></a>, will gain two new features: a Jules API to facilitate integration with IDEs and a Jules Tools CLI, allowing the agent to be opened directly on the command line. </p><div></div><p>More companies find that bringing their agents, coding-focused or not, into the applications people removes a lot of friction for enterprise users. Jules takes this trend a step further by adopting the same workflow as developers. </p><p>“Until today, you’ve primarily interacted with Jules in your web browser, but we know developers live in the terminal,” said Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, in <a href=\"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/meet-jules-tools-a-command-line-companion-for-googles-async-coding-agent/\"><u>a blog post</u></a>. “It’s where we test, build, debug, and ship. That’s why we built Jules Tools, a lightweight command line interface, so you can spin up tasks, inspect what Jules is doing, and make the agent your own, all without leaving your workflow.”</p><p>Through Jules CLI and API, Google said enterprises will get “more control and flexibility by where and how you can use Jules.”</p><p>In May, Google <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-jules-aims-to-out-code-codex-in-battle-for-the-ai-developer-stack\"><u>released Jules into beta</u></a> and announced GitHub integration. It became <a href=\"https://3e42b42d.streaklinks.com/Cmi6aMkMjB74AwirCQe5mABk/https%3A%2F%2Fblog.google%2Ftechnology%2Fgoogle-labs%2Fjules-now-available%2F\"><u>generally available</u></a> in August with higher rate limits for Google AI Pro and Ultra users. </p><h2>Moving away from chat</h2><p>As Korevec said, the primary way developers and enterprises interact with agents is through a chat interface. </p><p>Other coding agents have begun integrating their coding tools into IDEs and CLIs. <a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/dev/openai-unveils-new-model-gpt-5-codex-optimized-for-agentic-coding\"><u>rolled out a fine-tuned version</u></a> of GPT-5, called GPT-5-Codex, that will initiate the process of unifying its Codex coding assistant with IDEs, CLIs, and other workflows. Google also <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-is-redefining-enterprise-ai-economics-with-open-source-gemini-cli-that-will-be-free-for-the-majority-of-developers\"><u>released Gemini CLI</u></a>, which acts similarly to Jules Tools CLI, but is open-sourced and can be brought to other platforms. </p><p>Coding agents are already becoming essential tools for enterprises, and as their <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/github-leads-the-enterprise-claude-leads-the-pack-cursors-speed-cant-close\"><u>preferences solidify</u></a>, providers like Google, OpenAI and <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\"><u>Anthropic</u></a> want these agents to be more top of mind for users.   </p><p>Enterprises envision AI agents to be <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/whats-next-for-agentic-ai-langchain-founder-looks-to-ambient-agents\"><u>more passive, ambient tools,</u></a> which can be difficult to imagine if most people interact with them via chat and have to prompt them to work. If adoption is high, that more proactive and integrated future will be clearer. </p><h2>How Tools and API work</h2><p>Developers can install Jules Tools via npm, which will then print a guide on how to use it. While in the CLI, an engineer or coder can use the code Command to prompt Jules to do a task, and the code Flag will customize it. For example, this string, jules --theme light, will switch to light mode. </p><p>On the API side, enterprises can connect the Jules API to other platforms they use. They can connect it to Slack, for example, so that some team members can trigger tasks directly from Slack if a bug is reported there, which will then tap their CI/CD pipeline. </p><p>Google also added other updates to help reduce latency and fix some environment and file system issues. These include:</p><ul><li><p>File selector to call out specific files in chat to add context</p></li><li><p>Memory, which gives Jules the ability to remember preferences going forward</p></li><li><p>Environment Variables management that gives Jules access to these variables while executing a task</p></li></ul><h2>Response so far</h2><p>Since its announcement, the response has been mostly positive. However, some are confused over Google’s two coding agent CLI offerings. </p><div></div><div></div><div></div><p>\n\n\n\n\n</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/6DgO4LKk1asvY2loy5Uksj/c692f8e8345f2348e6d6571a6b303a7d/crimedy7_illustration_of_a_robot_coding_a_program_--ar_169_--_7dafd9d4-817a-4c5c-abbe-fb9112e639c7_3.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Salesforce launches AI 'trust layer' to tackle enterprise deployment failures plaguing 80% of projects]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/salesforce-launches-ai-trust-layer-to-tackle-enterprise-deployment-failures</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">1XqI5Q9sg1C7ADM0mlIz4W</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/\"><u>Salesforce Inc.</u></a> is expanding its artificial intelligence platform with new data management and governance capabilities, aiming to address what the company says is a crisis in enterprise AI adoption where more than 80% of projects fail to deliver meaningful business value.</p><p>The San Francisco-based software giant announced Thursday a suite of new tools designed to create what it calls a &quot;trusted AI foundation&quot; for enterprises struggling with fragmented data, weak governance, and security concerns that have hampered AI deployments across corporate America.</p><p>&quot;We&#x27;re seeing a lot of these AI projects really failing, and a lot of it&#x27;s because customers still have fragmented data, they still have weak governance, they still have poor security,&quot; said Desiree Motamedi, Salesforce&#x27;s senior vice president and chief marketing officer, in an exclusive interview with VentureBeat. &quot;They really want a way that they can bring AI at scale that has the accuracy, the context and the control.&quot;</p><p>The timing of Salesforce&#x27;s announcement comes as the company prepares for its annual <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/\"><u>Dreamforce conference</u></a> next week, where CEO Marc Benioff is expected to showcase the company&#x27;s vision for what he calls the &quot;<a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/ap/agentforce/agentic-enterprise/\"><u>agentic enterprise</u></a>&quot; — workplaces where AI agents work alongside humans across every business function.</p><h2><b>Why most corporate AI initiatives crash and burn before reaching production</b></h2><p>The scale of AI project failures has become a significant concern for enterprise technology leaders. According to a <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html\"><u>RAND Corporation study</u></a>, poor data quality, inadequate governance frameworks, and fragmented system integration are the primary culprits behind the high failure rate of corporate AI initiatives.</p><p>This challenge has created both pressure and opportunity for enterprise software providers. While companies face mounting pressure to deploy AI capabilities, many are discovering that their existing data infrastructure isn&#x27;t equipped to support reliable AI applications at scale.</p><p>Salesforce&#x27;s response centers on what Motamedi describes as three core capabilities: ensuring AI outputs are grounded in unified business data, embedding security and compliance controls into every workflow, and connecting AI agents across different platforms and data sources.</p><p>&quot;The Salesforce platform is a $7 billion business,&quot; Motamedi noted, highlighting the significant revenue opportunity the company sees in addressing enterprise AI infrastructure needs. &quot;This is a significant opportunity where we&#x27;re seeing meaningful differentiation from other vendors in the market.&quot;</p><h2><b>Inside Salesforce&#x27;s new AI tools designed to fix enterprise data chaos</b></h2><p>The company&#x27;s latest announcements include several technically sophisticated solutions aimed at different aspects of the enterprise AI challenge:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/form/demo/data-cloud-demo/?d=7013y000002ExgGAAS&amp;nc=7013y000002EySjAAK&amp;utm_content=7013y000002ExgGAAS&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;utm_campaign=21124892324&amp;utm_adgroup=161024384060&amp;utm_term=data%20software&amp;utm_matchtype=p&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21124892324&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4PnrPBb88pPnAYrypU8WWEYdx8g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwxfjGBhAUEiwAKWPwDhNDbBp4P2o_OuM2D0m0MWQS3O0LZFu25_L1MoKpBPqYX5M9VTKRUBoC0ScQAvD_BwE\"><u>Data Cloud Context Indexing </u></a>represents Salesforce&#x27;s approach to handling unstructured content like contracts, technical diagrams, and decision trees. The system uses what the company calls a &quot;business-aware lens&quot; to help AI agents interpret complex documents within their proper business context.</p><p>&quot;A good example is a field engineer who uploads a schematic for guided troubleshooting,&quot; Motamedi explained. &quot;Now they have that capability at their disposal, because it&#x27;s right there in that view.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/form/demo/data-cloud-demo/?d=701ed000003k7J0AAI&amp;nc=701ed000003kDcvAAE&amp;utm_content=701ed000003k7J0AAI&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid_search&amp;utm_campaign=21124892324&amp;utm_adgroup=176980111604&amp;utm_term=data%20cleansing&amp;utm_matchtype=p&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21124892324&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4PnrPBb88pPnAYrypU8WWEYdx8g&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwxfjGBhAUEiwAKWPwDk001xVkCvIob4Vk_cw4ILVfg3wlmxgGaglkOCLSuYHa9RkuO9aJkxoCeS8QAvD_BwE\"><u>Data Cloud Clean Rooms</u></a>, now generally available, allows organizations to securely share and analyze data with partners without exposing sensitive information. Using Salesforce&#x27;s &quot;zero copy&quot; technology, companies can collaborate on data analysis without actually moving or duplicating datasets.</p><p>The clean room technology extends beyond traditional advertising applications to sectors like banking, where institutions could &quot;detect fraud, and they want to be able to do it with some of their partners. They could now do it in hours versus weeks,&quot; according to Motamedi.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tableau.com/products/tableau-semantics\"><u>Tableau Semantics</u></a> addresses one of the most persistent challenges in enterprise data management: ensuring consistent definitions of business metrics across different systems and teams. The AI-powered semantic layer translates raw data into standardized business language.</p><p>&quot;We use terms like ACV or churn that have specific definitions within our organization,&quot; Motamedi said. &quot;Making sure AI understands those definitions, and then having a standardized layer across organizations, really makes this seamless for enterprises.&quot;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/mulesoft-agent-fabric-announcement/\"><u>MuleSoft Agent Fabric</u></a> tackles what Salesforce calls &quot;agent sprawl&quot; — the proliferation of AI agents across different platforms and vendors within large organizations. The system provides centralized registration, orchestration, and governance for AI agents regardless of where they were built.</p><h2><b>How Salesforce plans to battle Microsoft, Google and Amazon for AI dominance</b></h2><p>Salesforce&#x27;s comprehensive approach to AI infrastructure positions the company in direct competition with <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/\"><u>Microsoft</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><u>Google</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\"><u>Amazon</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a>, all of which are vying to become the dominant platform for enterprise AI deployment.</p><p>The company&#x27;s strategy relies heavily on integration advantages that come from building AI capabilities into an existing platform used by thousands of enterprises. &quot;The power of the platform&quot; lies in the fact that &quot;all of this is natively into the platform. So these capabilities are just there, and they work and they work seamlessly together,&quot; Motamedi emphasized.</p><p>This integrated approach contrasts with point solutions that require custom integration work. &quot;Some of these point solutions, if you want these things to work together, you got to build those integrations. You got to have developer teams to make that happen,&quot; she noted.</p><p>The company&#x27;s pending $8 billion acquisition of data management company Informatica, expected to close soon, will significantly expand Salesforce&#x27;s capabilities in enterprise metadata management — a critical component for AI accuracy.</p><p>&quot;For the last 26 years, Salesforce has been rooted in our platform approach — we&#x27;ve built the metadata layer from day one,&quot; Motamedi said. &quot;But with Informatica, we&#x27;re going to see metadata across the entire enterprise, and that gives us another layer of accuracy for AI responses.&quot;</p><h2><b>Early enterprise customers reveal the reality of scaling AI in large organizations</b></h2><p>Despite the technical capabilities, Salesforce acknowledges that enterprise AI adoption remains in early stages. The company reports having &quot;over 12,000 live deployments of Agentforce&quot; — its AI agent platform — but Motamedi describes a wide range of organizational readiness.</p><p>&quot;Every company has a mandate right now to figure out how they can incorporate AI,&quot; she said. &quot;We see very interesting ranges from people who are just getting started to people who are like, we&#x27;re going to build like 80 different agents within their organization.&quot;</p><p>Early customer implementations include <a href=\"https://wa.aaa.com/home\"><u>AAA Washington</u></a>, which is using Salesforce&#x27;s unified data foundation to improve member experiences across roadside assistance, insurance, and travel services. <a href=\"https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/\"><u>UChicago Medicine</u></a> is leveraging the platform to ensure reliable patient interactions while enabling healthcare staff to focus on complex, human-centered care.</p><p>The maturity curve for enterprise AI adoption means &quot;it&#x27;s going to take a couple years to see it fully, fully embraced, but we already see the path,&quot; according to Motamedi.</p><h2><b>What Salesforce&#x27;s AI governance push means for the future of enterprise software</b></h2><p>The broader implications of Salesforce&#x27;s strategy extend beyond technical capabilities to fundamental questions about how enterprises will manage AI risk and governance. The company&#x27;s emphasis on built-in security and compliance reflects growing corporate awareness that AI deployment without proper controls can create significant business liability.</p><p>Recent incidents involving AI agents accessing sensitive information or providing unreliable outputs have made corporate leaders more cautious about scaling AI initiatives. Salesforce&#x27;s approach of embedding security directly into AI workflows — including automated threat detection partnerships with <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/\"><u>CrowdStrike</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.okta.com/\"><u>Okta</u></a>, and built-in HIPAA compliance for healthcare applications — represents an attempt to address these concerns while accelerating adoption.</p><p>However, market skepticism remains. CNBC&#x27;s Jim Cramer <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jim-cramer-salesforce-gotta-more-180432550.html\"><u>recently noted concerns</u></a> about Salesforce&#x27;s performance despite strong quarterly reports, suggesting that investor expectations for AI-driven growth may be outpacing actual business results.</p><p>The company&#x27;s success will ultimately depend on whether it can help enterprises bridge the gap between AI experimentation and production-scale deployment. As Motamedi framed it: &quot;We really believe that we have a trust layer for enterprise AI with all of these new announcements, and we&#x27;re really helping companies move from cautious pilots to transformative action.&quot;</p><p>Whether that vision becomes reality will depend on Salesforce&#x27;s ability to prove that integrated platforms can solve enterprise AI&#x27;s trust problem better than the patchwork of point solutions most companies rely on today. In an industry where <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41368935\"><u>80% of projects fail</u></a>, the company that finally cracks the code on reliable, scalable enterprise AI could reshape how business gets done — or discover that the technical challenges run deeper than any single platform can solve.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Big Data</category>\n            <category>Automation</category>\n            <category>Data Infrastructure</category>\n            <category>Data management</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/48XIfBjEA8DoLNpIystf9B/bd01a15251d9d54f64a7ae8d5d23d1ba/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_layered_data_cloud_12e322ec-5b63-4bec-a9ce-7a255cb1694e.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA['Western Qwen': IBM wows with Granite 4 LLM launch and hybrid Mamba/Transformer architecture]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/western-qwen-ibm-wows-with-granite-4-llm-launch-and-hybrid-mamba-transformer</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">44LJDVCXNF5XCgUh9aZQGi</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>IBM today <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/new/announcements/ibm-granite-4-0-hyper-efficient-high-performance-hybrid-models\">announced the release of Granite 4.0</a>, the newest generation of its homemade family of open source large language models (LLMs) designed to balance high performance with lower memory and cost requirements. </p><p>Despite being one of the oldest active tech companies in the U.S. (founded in 1911, 114 years ago!), &quot;Big Blue&quot; as its often <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Blue_(disambiguation)\">nicknamed</a> has already wowed many AI industry workers and followers with this new Granite 4.0 family of LLMs, as they offer high performance on third-party benchmarks; a permissive, business friendly license (Apache 2.0) that allows developers and enterprises to freely take, modify and deploy the models for their own commercial purposes; and, perhaps most importantly, have symbolically put the U.S. back into a competitive place with the growing raft of high-performing new generation open source Chinese LLMs, especially from<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/its-qwens-summer-new-open-source-qwen3-235b-a22b-thinking-2507-tops-openai-gemini-reasoning-models-on-key-benchmarks\"> Alibaba&#x27;s prolific Qwen team</a> — <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-returns-to-open-source-roots-with-new-models-gpt-oss-120b-and-gpt-oss-20b\">alongside OpenAI with its gpt-oss model</a> family released earlier this summer.</p><p>Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, was once seen as the world and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-leads-open-source-ai-boom-llama-downloads-surge-10x-year-over-year\">U.S. leader of open source LLMs with its Llama models</a>, but after the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-defends-llama-4-release-against-reports-of-mixed-quality-blames-bugs\">disappointing release of the Llama 4 family</a> in April and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1m0g2mk/well_if_anyone_was_waiting_for_llama_4_behemoth/\">lack of its planned, most powerful Llama 4 Behemoth</a>, it has since pursued a different strategy and is now <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-is-partnering-with-midjourney-and-will-license-its-technology-for-future-models-and-products/\">partnering with outside labs like Midjourney on AI products</a>, while it continues to build out an expensive, in-house <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/mark-zuckerberg-says-developing-superintelligence-is-now-in-sight-shades-openai-and-other-firms-focused-on-automating-work\">AI &quot;Superintelligence&quot; team</a>, as well. </p><p>Little wonder AI engineer Alexander Doria (aka Pierre-Carl Langlais) observed, with a hilarious <i>Lethal Weapon</i> meme, that &quot;ibm suiting up again after llama 4 fumbled,&quot; and &quot;we finally have western qwen.&quot;</p><div></div><h3><b>Hybrid (Transformer/Mamba) theory</b></h3><p>At the heart of IBM&#x27;s Granite 4.0 release is a new hybrid design that combines two very different architectures, or underlying organizational structures, for the LLMs in question: transformers and Mamba.</p><p>Transformers, introduced in 2017 by Vaswani and colleagues in the famous Google paper “<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762\">Attention Is All You Need,</a>” power most large language models in use today.</p><p>In this design, every token — essentially a small chunk of text, like a word or part of a word — can compare itself to every other token in the input. This “all-to-all” comparison is what gives transformers their strong ability to capture context and meaning across a passage. </p><p>The trade-off is efficiency: because the model must calculate relationships between every possible pair of tokens in the context window, computation and memory demands grow rapidly as the input gets longer. This quadratic scaling makes transformers costly to run on very long documents or at high volume.</p><p>Mamba, by contrast, is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752\">a newer architecture developed in late 2023</a> by researchers Albert Gu and Tri Dao at Carnegie Mellon University and Princeton University. Instead of comparing every token against all the others at once, it processes tokens one at a time, updating its internal state as it moves through the sequence. This design scales only linearly with input length, making it far more efficient at handling long documents or multiple requests at once. The trade-off is that transformers still tend to perform better in certain kinds of reasoning and “few-shot” learning, where it helps to hold many detailed token-to-token comparisons in memory.</p><p>This enables much greater efficiency, especially for long documents or multi-session inference, though transformers retain advantages for some reasoning and few-shot learning tasks. </p><p>But whether the model is built on transformers, Mamba, or a hybrid of the two, the way it generates new words works the same way. At each step, the model doesn’t just pick from what’s already in the context window. Instead, it uses its internal weights — built from training on trillions of text samples — to predict the most likely next token from its entire vocabulary. That’s why, when prompted with “The capital of France is…,” the model can output “Paris” even if “Paris” isn’t in the input text. It has learned from countless training examples that “Paris” is a highly probable continuation in that context. In other words, the context window guides the prediction, but the embedding space — the model’s learned representation of all tokens it knows — supplies the actual words it can generate.</p><p><b>By combining Mamba-2 layers with transformer blocks, Granite 4.0 seeks to offer the best of both worlds: the efficiency of Mamba and the contextual precision of transformers.</b></p><p>This is the first official Granite release to adopt the hybrid approach. IBM previewed it earlier in 2025 with the Granite-4.0-Tiny-Preview, but Granite 4.0 marks the company’s first full family of models built on the Mamba-transformer combination.</p><p>Granite 4.0 is being positioned as an enterprise-ready alternative to conventional transformer-based models, with particular emphasis on agentic AI tasks such as instruction following, function calling, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The models are open sourced under the Apache 2.0 license, cryptographically signed for authenticity, and stand out as the first open language model family certified under ISO 42001, an international standard for AI governance and transparency.</p><h3><b>Reducing memory needs, expanding accessibility</b></h3><p>One of Granite 4.0’s defining features is its ability to significantly reduce GPU memory consumption compared to traditional large language models. </p><p>IBM reports that the hybrid Mamba-transformer design can cut RAM requirements by more than 70% (!!!) in production environments, especially for workloads involving long contexts and multiple concurrent sessions.</p><p>Benchmarks released alongside the launch illustrate these improvements. </p><p>Granite-4.0-H-Small, a 32B-parameter mixture-of-experts model with 9B active parameters, maintains strong throughput on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, continuing to accelerate even under workloads that typically strain transformer-only systems. </p><p>This efficiency translates directly into lower hardware costs for enterprises running intensive inference tasks.</p><p>For smaller-scale or edge deployments, Granite 4.0 offers two lighter options: Granite-4.0-H-Tiny, a 7B-parameter hybrid with 1B active parameters, and Granite-4.0-H-Micro, a 3B dense hybrid. IBM is also releasing Granite-4.0-Micro, a 3B transformer-only model intended for platforms not yet optimized for Mamba-based architectures.</p><h3><b>Performance benchmarks</b></h3><p>Performance metrics suggest that the new models not only reduce costs but also compete with larger systems on enterprise-critical tasks. </p><p>According to Stanford HELM’s IFEval benchmark, which measures how well LLMs follow instructions from users, Granite-4.0-H-Small surpasses nearly all open weight models in instruction-following accuracy, ranking just behind Meta’s much larger Llama 4 Maverick.</p><p>The models also show strong results on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard v3, where Granite-4.0-H-Small achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and hosted API pricing. On retrieval-augmented generation tasks, Granite 4.0 models post some of the highest mean accuracy scores among open competitors.</p><p>Notably, IBM highlights that even Granite 4.0’s smallest models outperform Granite 3.3 8B, despite being less than half its size, underscoring the gains achieved through both architectural changes and refined training methods.</p><h3><b>Trust, safety, and security</b></h3><p>Alongside technical efficiency, IBM is emphasizing governance and trust. Granite is the first open model family to achieve ISO/IEC 42001:2023 certification, demonstrating compliance with international standards for AI accountability, data privacy, and explainability.</p><p>The company has also partnered with HackerOne to run a bug bounty program for Granite, offering up to $100,000 for vulnerabilities that could expose security flaws or adversarial risks. Additionally, every Granite 4.0 model checkpoint is cryptographically signed, enabling developers to verify provenance and integrity before deployment.</p><p>IBM provides indemnification for customers using Granite on its watsonx.ai platform, covering third-party intellectual property claims against AI-generated content.</p><h3><b>Training and roadmap</b></h3><p>Granite 4.0 models were trained on a 22-trillion-token corpus sourced from enterprise-relevant datasets including DataComp-LM, Wikipedia, and curated subsets designed to support language, code, math, multilingual tasks, and cybersecurity. </p><p>Post-training is split between instruction-tuned models, released today, and reasoning-focused “Thinking” variants, which are expected later this fall.</p><p>IBM plans to expand the family by the end of 2025 with additional models, including Granite 4.0 Medium for heavier enterprise workloads and Granite 4.0 Nano for edge deployments.</p><h3><b>Broad availability across platforms</b></h3><p>Granite 4.0 models are available immediately on <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-40-language-models-6811a18b820ef362d9e5a82c\">Hugging Face</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=2053649837958&amp;p5=e&amp;p9=151965724954&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=20116653496&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-_QsS-fCqA1AzHT8mAQSlNe2Trg&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwxfjGBhAUEiwAKWPwDvQ-9svH-7coSeeazcTRpZbhBo-cKhpUNcZ0MS2OKbV0gsLjdNSosxoCX20QAvD_BwE\">IBM watsonx.ai</a>, with distribution also through partners such as Dell Technologies, Docker Hub, Kaggle, LM Studio, NVIDIA NIM, Ollama, OPAQUE, and Replicate. </p><p>Support through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart and Microsoft Azure AI Foundry is expected soon.</p><p>The hybrid architecture is supported in major inference frameworks, including vLLM 0.10.2 and Hugging Face Transformers. </p><p>Compatibility has also been extended to llama.cpp and MLX, although optimization work is ongoing. The models are also usable in Unsloth for fine-tuning and in Continue for custom AI coding assistants.</p><h3><b>Enterprise focus</b></h3><p>Early access testing by enterprise partners, including EY and Lockheed Martin, has guided the launch. </p><p>IBM highlights that the models are tailored for real-world enterprise needs, such as supporting multi-agent workflows, customer support automation, and large-scale retrieval systems.</p><p>Granite 4.0 models are available in both Base and Instruct forms, with Instruct variants optimized for enterprise instruction-following tasks. The upcoming “Thinking” series will target advanced reasoning.</p><h3><b>Alternate hybrid Mamba / Transformer models</b></h3><p>Besides IBM, several major efforts are already charting different designs for mixing Transformers with Mamba architecture:</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>Model</p></td><td><p>Hybrid strategy / architecture</p></td><td><p>Highlights</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai21-debuts-jamba-1-5-boosting-hybrid-ssm-transformer-model-to-enable-agentic-ai\"><b>AI21 Jamba</b></a></p></td><td><p>Interleaves Transformer blocks and Mamba layers, with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) in some layers</p></td><td><p>Supports context lengths up to 256K tokens and offers higher throughput and lower memory usage than pure Transformers while maintaining competitive benchmarks</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-releases-a-new-small-open-model-nemotron-nano-9b-v2-with-toggle-on-off-reasoning\"><b>Nvidia Nemotron-H</b></a></p></td><td><p>Replaces most attention layers with Mamba-2 blocks, retaining a few attention layers where needed</p></td><td><p>Demonstrates up to 3× faster inference throughput compared to pure-Transformer peers while keeping benchmark accuracy comparable</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-releases-a-new-small-open-model-nemotron-nano-9b-v2-with-toggle-on-off-reasoning\"><b>Nemotron-Nano-2</b></a></p></td><td><p>A reasoning-optimized hybrid built on Nemotron’s design</p></td><td><p>Reports up to 6× throughput improvement on reasoning tasks while matching or surpassing accuracy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><b>Domain-specific variants</b></p></td><td><p>Hybridized architectures in multimodal models, such as swapping in Mamba layers for decoder components</p></td><td><p>Shows that the hybrid approach extends beyond text into vision-language applications</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>The Qwen family from Alibaba remains a dense, decoder-only Transformer architecture, with no Mamba or SSM layers in its mainline models. However, experimental offshoots like Vamba-Qwen2-VL-7B show that hybrids derived from Qwen are possible, especially in vision-language settings. For now, though, Qwen itself is not part of the hybrid wave.</p><h3><b>What Granite 4.0 means for enterprises and what&#x27;s next</b></h3><p>Granite 4.0 reflects IBM’s strategy of combining open access with enterprise-grade safety, scalability, and efficiency. By focusing on lowering inference costs and reinforcing trust with governance standards, IBM positions the Granite family as a practical foundation for enterprises building AI applications at scale.</p><p>For the U.S., the release carries symbolic weight: with Meta stepping back from leading the open-weight frontier after the uneven reception of Llama 4, and with Alibaba’s Qwen family rapidly advancing in China, IBM’s move positions American enterprise once again as a competitive force in globally available models. </p><p>By making Granite 4.0 Apache-licensed, cryptographically signed, and ISO 42001-certified, IBM is signaling both openness and responsibility at a moment when trust, efficiency, and affordability are top of mind. This is especially enticing to U.S. and Western-based organizations who may be interested in open source models, but wary of those originating from China — rightly or not — over possible political ramifications and U.S. government contracts.</p><p>For practitioners inside organizations, this positioning is not abstract. Lead AI engineers tasked with managing the full lifecycle of LLMs will see Granite 4.0’s smaller memory footprint as a way to deploy faster and scale with leaner teams. </p><p>Senior AI engineers in orchestration roles, who must balance budget limits with the need for efficiency, can take advantage of Granite’s compatibility with mainstream platforms like SageMaker and Hugging Face to streamline pipelines without locking into proprietary ecosystems. </p><p>Senior data engineers, responsible for integrating AI with complex data systems, will note the hybrid models’ efficiency on long-context inputs, enabling retrieval-augmented generation on large datasets at lower cost. </p><p>And for IT security directors charged with managing day-to-day defense, IBM’s bug bounty program, cryptographic signing, and ISO accreditation provide clear governance signals that align with enterprise compliance needs.</p><p>By targeting these distinct roles with a model family that is efficient, open, and hardened for enterprise use, IBM is not only courting adoption but also shaping a uniquely American answer to the open-source challenge posed by Qwen and other Chinese entrants. In doing so, Granite 4.0 places IBM at the center of a new phase in the global LLM race — one defined not just by size and speed, but by trust, cost efficiency, and readiness for real-world deployment.</p><p>With additional models scheduled for release before the end of the year and broader availability across major AI development platforms, Granite 4.0 is set to play a central role in IBM’s vision of enterprise-ready, open-source AI.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/3mUEXkfbZzFQU13ok91Ge1/5d45f30c7caee9db4f3fcf50a0de08ad/cfr0z3n_hyperrealistic_detailed_graphic_novel_epic_cosmic_sci-f_ebca386f-881a-4d02-8447-fb58434a989b.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n    </channel>\n</rss>"

Samsung’s work challenges the prevailing assumption that sheer scale is the only way to advance the capabilities of AI models, offering a more sustainable and parameter-efficient alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overcoming-the-limits-of-scale\">Overcoming the limits of scale</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While LLMs have shown incredible prowess in generating human-like text, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning can be brittle. Because they generate answers token-by-token, a single mistake early in the process can derail the entire solution, leading to an invalid final answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, where a model &#8220;thinks out loud&#8221; to break down a problem, have been developed to mitigate this. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often require vast amounts of high-quality reasoning data that may not be available, and can still produce flawed logic. Even with these augmentations, LLMs struggle with certain puzzles where perfect logical execution is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s work builds upon a recent AI model known as the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). HRM introduced a novel method using two small neural networks that recursively work on a problem at different frequencies to refine an answer. It showed great promise but was complicated, relying on uncertain biological arguments and complex fixed-point theorems that were not guaranteed to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of HRM&#8217;s two networks, TRM uses a single, tiny network that recursively improves both its internal &#8220;reasoning&#8221; and its proposed &#8220;answer&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model is given the question, an initial guess at the answer, and a latent reasoning feature. It first cycles through several steps to refine its latent reasoning based on all three inputs. Then, using this improved reasoning, it updates its prediction for the final answer. This entire process can be repeated up to 16 times, allowing the model to progressively correct its own mistakes in a highly parameter-efficient manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterintuitively, the research discovered that a tiny network with only two layers achieved far better generalisation than a four-layer version. This reduction in size appears to prevent the model from overfitting; a common problem when training on smaller, specialised datasets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRM also dispenses with the complex mathematical justifications used by its predecessor. The original HRM model required the assumption that its functions converged to a fixed point to justify its training method. TRM bypasses this entirely by simply back-propagating through its full recursion process. This change alone provided a massive boost in performance, improving accuracy on the Sudoku-Extreme benchmark from 56.5% to 87.4% in an ablation study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-samsung-s-model-smashes-ai-benchmarks-with-fewer-resources\">Samsung’s model smashes AI benchmarks with fewer resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The results speak for themselves. On the Sudoku-Extreme dataset, which uses only 1,000 training examples, TRM achieves an 87.4% test accuracy, a huge leap from HRM&#8217;s 55%. On Maze-Hard, a task involving finding long paths through 30&#215;30 mazes, TRM scores 85.3% compared to HRM&#8217;s 74.5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most notably, TRM makes huge strides on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), a benchmark designed to measure true fluid intelligence in AI. With just 7M parameters, TRM achieves 44.6% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 7.8% on ARC-AGI-2. This outperforms HRM, which used a 27M parameter model, and even surpasses many of the world&#8217;s largest LLMs. For comparison, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores only 4.9% on ARC-AGI-2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The training process for TRM has also been made more efficient. An adaptive mechanism called ACT – which decides when the model has improved an answer enough and can move to a new data sample – was simplified to remove the need for a second, costly forward pass through the network during each training step. This change was made with no major difference in final generalisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This research from Samsung presents a compelling argument against the current trajectory of ever-expanding AI models. It shows that by designing architectures that can iteratively reason and self-correct, it is possible to solve extremely difficult problems with a tiny fraction of the computational resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-new-ai-agent-rewrites-code-automate-vulnerability-fixes/\"><strong>Google’s new AI agent rewrites code to automate vulnerability fixes</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Last year, healthcare company Advanced was fined £6 million for losing patient records that, among other details, contained information about how to gain entry to the homes of 890 care receivers. Even the smallest oversights can <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/paypal-fined-2-million-for-cybersecurity-lapse-exposing-user-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create unpleasant headlines</a> and catastrophic fines.</p>\n<p>This is the reality of modern data handling: leaks can be catastrophic, and compliance frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and FERPA, plus FOIA requests, require more vigilance than manual redaction can provide. What organizations need is not more staff to ensure proper redaction, but tools that achieve it quickly, reliably, and securely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/caseguard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CaseGuard Studio</a>, a US-based AI redaction &amp; investigation platform, has built software that automates this manual work with 98% accuracy. It can process thousands of files in minutes, working on data that&#8217;s kept securely on-premises of any file type, including video, audio, documents, and images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-why-manual-redaction-no-longer-works\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Manual Redaction No Longer Works</h3>\n<p>Redaction is not new, but the tools most people reach for were not built for the complexity of today’s compliance requirements. Adobe Acrobat, for example, offers text redaction but needs manual work on each document. Premiere&#8217;s video editing software requires frame-by-frame subject tracking for <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/video-redaction-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video redaction</a>, which is slow and impractical. These solutions provide only limited capability and were never designed for departments that process a multitude of redactions on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>CaseGuard Studio, by contrast, was purpose-built for just this challenge. It can detect 12 categories of PII (personally-identifiable information) in video and images, such as faces, license plates, notepads, and more. It tracks and redacts all PII without needing manual frame-by-frame intervention.</p>\n<p>For audio and documents, CaseGuard Studio supports over 30 PII types, like names, phone numbers, and addresses. Custom keywords, phrases, or sentences can be auto-detected and redacted directly from thousands of documents and transcripts, streamlining compliance in ways manual tools can’t match. It transcribes recordings with high accuracy and can translate to and from 100+ languages, so it can redact sensitive terms in multilingual content.</p>\n<p>What once took days of human labor can now happen in minutes. <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/caseguard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CaseGuard Studio</a> automates redaction work with 98% accuracy, up to 30 times faster than manual methods, and because it runs fully on-premise, data never leaves the device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-what-to-ask-when-choosing-redaction-software\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Ask When Choosing Redaction Software</h3>\n<p>For organizations evaluating redaction software, the decision often comes down to a handful of critical questions that determine whether a platform can deliver on both compliance and efficiency. The following questions are central to making the right choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can the software handle every file type we work with?</strong> From scanned forms and handwritten notes to video, audio, and still images, organizations in sensitive sectors deal with more than PDFs.</li>\n<li><strong>Is the platform fully automated?</strong> If redaction still means blacking out text with a Sharpie or scrubbing video frame by frame, the process is slow and prone to error. Full automation ensures accuracy and frees staff for higher-impact work.</li>\n<li><strong>Does the software ensure data never leaves your environment?</strong> On-premise deployment means sensitive files are processed locally, so nothing is exposed to third-party servers or cloud risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Does the pricing stay predictable as you scale?</strong> Per-file or per-minute pricing quickly becomes unsustainable as workloads grow. Look for a flat subscription with unlimited redaction, so costs stay predictable no matter how much data you process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h-evaluating-caseguard-studio-against-the-four-redaction-essentials\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaluating CaseGuard Studio Against the Four Redaction Essentials</h3>\n<p>When assessed against these requirements, CaseGuard Studio was the only platform in our evaluation that consistently delivered across all five redaction essentials.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Auto-redact files from any source</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From text documents and scanned forms to video, audio, images, and even handwriting, redaction has to cover every format where sensitive information might appear. Missing one identifiable feature, a face in a crowd or an un-redacted license plate, and a single oversight can be the difference between full compliance and a lawsuit. CaseGuard Studio automatically detects and redacts sensitive information across all these file types within a single platform with complete compliance.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Automated bulk redaction at speed and scale</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thousands of files can be redacted in bulk, turning weeks of manual effort into minutes of processing. CaseGuard Studio handles workloads up to 32x faster than manual methods, with 98% accuracy, giving organizations the speed and scalability to meet growing compliance demands.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Your data, your control</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>CaseGuard Studio runs fully on-premise, within your secure environment, including air-gapped systems that are completely isolated from external networks. This ensures organizations retain full control of their data, with nothing exposed to third-party servers or cloud risks.</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Unlimited redaction, no pay-per-file fees</strong></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Pay-per-file pricing quickly adds up, making every additional redaction more expensive. CaseGuard Studio offers predictable pricing under a flat subscription with unlimited redaction, so costs remain the same no matter how heavy the redaction load is.</p>\n<p> </p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"See CaseGuard in Action | AI-Powered Redaction Software for Video, Audio, Documents &amp; Images\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/toq6hNK5cCc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of our evaluation, we compared methods and platforms ranging from manual redaction and legacy PDF editors to newer AI-driven tools that have appeared in the last few years. Most delivered partial solutions, treating written documents well but failing on audio, while others blurred faces in video, but weren’t practical to use at scale. Cloud-only options raised sovereignty and compliance concerns that, for many users, would count them out of the running entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CaseGuard Studio was the only platform that consistently met all five requirements detailed above. It supports the widest of file types, from body-cam video to scanned or handwritten forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio and video are probably the most difficult formats to redact, especially at scale. Here, CaseGuard wins our vote with its AI-powered smarts. It runs fully on-premise, keeps sensitive files under organizational control, and its local AI models are refined with each version release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when many <a href=\"https://caseguard.com/articles/data-protection-and-privacy-cloud-redaction-risk/%20?utm_source=blog-outreach-cloud&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;utm_campaign=AI+News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cloud redaction software</a> licensing models drive up costs as workloads grow, CaseGuard’s flat pricing offers a refreshing change — predictable, transparent, and sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any organization facing rising compliance demands and ever-larger volumes of sensitive data, CaseGuard Studio is well worth a closer look. <a href=\"https://caseguard.com/get-a-demo/?utm_source=blog-outreach-getademo&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;utm_campaign=AI+News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here to book a consultation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

From curated videos on Instagram Reels to booking engines that build entire itineraries in seconds, AI is becoming a powerful force in how journeys are imagined, booked, and lived. But this shift raises an important question: is AI giving travellers more freedom, or quietly steering their choices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit, believes AI can do both, speaking to <em>AI News</em>. In a wide-ranging conversation, he explained how AI is transforming travel discovery, personalisation, cultural exchange, and ethics—and why the industry must set clear guardrails as technology takes on a more active role.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-as-a-travel-companion\">AI as a travel companion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is changing how people discover destinations. Instead of generic travel lists, platforms now serve content that feels personal. “AI has turned travel discovery into a personal canvas,” Hamidaddin said. “Platforms like Instagram Reels no longer just show ‘where to go’; they curate journeys that feel tailor-made for each traveller.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"785\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07.avif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109759\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:300px;height:300px\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07.avif 785w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07-300x290.avif 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07-768x744.avif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift is not just about convenience. By highlighting lesser-known destinations, AI can spread demand and ease pressure on crowded tourist spots. It can also introduce travellers to authentic local experiences that might otherwise remain hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamidaddin sees the next phase as “agentic AI”—technology that doesn’t just make suggestions but takes action. He described a future where AI automatically rebooks flights disrupted by weather, adjusts itineraries, and reschedules reservations in real time. “That’s frictionless travel—where the logistics fade and the adventure takes centre stage,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-personalisation-vs-algorithmic-influence-in-travel\">AI personalisation vs. algorithmic influence in travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-driven booking engines promise hyper-personalised recommendations, matching experiences to individual interests and budgets. This can make planning smoother and more inspiring, but it also comes with risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They do both,” Hamidaddin said when asked whether AI empowers travellers or guides them without their knowledge. “AI can empower travellers like never before—matching experiences to passions, budgets, and even moods. But unchecked, algorithms can quietly narrow horizons, nudging people toward predictable options. This risk only increases with agentic AI, which will make decisions on travellers’ behalf. That’s why transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. AI should be a compass, not a cage, and travellers must always hold the final word.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trust-and-transparency\">Trust and transparency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The balance between personalisation and privacy will shape the next era of travel. As AI systems collect vast amounts of personal data, travellers are more aware of how their preferences, clicks, and searches are used. Hamidaddin stressed that trust is the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The era of hyper-personalisation must be built on trust. Travellers know their data is powerful, and they’re right to ask how it’s being used,” he said. The solution, in his view, is “radical transparency: explicit consent, clear explanations, and real opt-in choices.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agentic AI, which can act on a traveller’s behalf, makes this even more important. If algorithms are booking, adjusting, or cancelling plans automatically, travellers need clear ways to control and understand these actions. “True innovation doesn’t just customise the journey; it safeguards the traveller’s confidence and autonomy,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-setting-standards-through-tourise\">Setting standards through TOURISE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamidaddin will lead discussions on these topics at the inaugural TOURISE Summit in Riyadh this November. He sees the summit as a chance to shape global standards for AI use in travel, not just showcase technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The TOURISE is designed to be more than an event—it’s the world’s first platform where government, business, and technology leaders unite to shape travel tech responsibly,” he said. His goals include creating a shared ethical framework for AI, encouraging partnerships to address privacy and workforce challenges, promoting sustainability, and training the global tourism workforce to thrive in an AI-driven industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“TOURISE must set a new benchmark: innovation with integrity,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cultural-exchange-and-economic-growth\">Cultural exchange and economic growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI’s influence goes beyond logistics. It is also changing cultural exchange and economic development, particularly in Saudi Arabia. “AI is dissolving barriers—linguistic, cultural, and economic. It’s curating authentic connections that go beyond sightseeing into meaningful exchange,” Hamidaddin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained how Saudi Arabia is using AI to highlight cultural and historical treasures like AlUla and Diriyah, while supporting artisans, festivals, and small businesses. Agentic AI will help create smoother travel experiences that allow visitors to focus more on culture and less on planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This isn’t just about more visitors; it’s about inclusive growth, mutual respect, and shared prosperity,” he said. By 2030, AI is expected to contribute $135 billion to Saudi Arabia’s GDP, with tourism playing a central role. But for Hamidaddin, the real impact is measured in “bonds between people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ethical-guardrails-for-ai-in-travel\">Ethical guardrails for AI in travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI systems take on more responsibility, clear ethical standards become essential. Hamidaddin outlined several priorities: making AI usage clear to users, regularly auditing algorithms for bias, giving travellers control over their data, and designing systems that promote cultural diversity and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With agentic AI, the stakes rise: when an AI acts on a traveller’s behalf, we must ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability. Agency must never replace autonomy,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-innovation-with-ethics\">Innovation with ethics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The debate isn’t about whether to adopt AI, but how to do so responsibly. Hamidaddin argues that innovation should align with human values and environmental priorities. “It’s not about chasing every shiny new tool; it’s about aligning innovation with human values and planetary needs,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He believes governments, businesses, communities, and travellers must collaborate to agree on shared principles. Agentic AI makes this even more urgent, as decisions may increasingly be made by machines. “Our job is to ensure technology serves people, not the other way around,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-era-for-travel\">A new era for travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamidaddin is optimistic about what lies ahead. “What excites me most is that travel is becoming transformative again,” he said. He imagines a future where language barriers disappear, itineraries adapt in real time, and every trip supports local communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Saudi Arabia, platforms like “Spirit of Saudi” are already using AI to showcase authentic experiences, from desert adventures to artisan workshops. The next step is agentic journeys, where AI travel companions handle logistics seamlessly, freeing travellers to focus on discovery and connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At TOURISE, I believe we’re not simply shaping tourism’s future—we’re igniting a new era of connection and shared prosperity across the globe,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@socialcut?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">S O C I A L .

Yet as these models stretch into important spaces like real-time supply chain routing, medical diagnostics, and financial markets, something as simple as a stealthy data shift or an undetected anomaly can flip confident automation into costly breakdown or public embarrassment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just a problem for data scientists or machine learning engineers. Today, product managers, compliance officers, and business leaders are realising that AI&#8217;s value doesn&#8217;t just hinge on building a high-performing model, but on deeply understanding how, why, and when these models behave the way they do once exposed to the messiness of the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter AI observability, a discipline that&#8217;s no longer an optional add-on, but a daily reality for teams committed to reliable, defensible, and scalable AI-driven products.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-best-ai-observability-tools-in-2025\">The best AI observability tools in 2025</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.

The system, aptly-named CodeMender, has already contributed 72 security fixes to established open-source projects in the last six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying and patching vulnerabilities is a notoriously difficult and time-consuming process, even with the aid of traditional automated methods like fuzzing. Google DeepMind’s own research, including AI-based projects such as Big Sleep and OSS-Fuzz, has proven effective at discovering new zero-day vulnerabilities in well-audited code. This success, however, creates a new bottleneck: as AI accelerates the discovery of flaws, the burden on human developers to fix them intensifies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CodeMender is engineered to address this imbalance. It functions as an autonomous AI agent that takes a comprehensive approach to fix code security. Its capabilities are both reactive, allowing it to patch newly discovered vulnerabilities instantly, and proactive, enabling it to rewrite existing code to eliminate entire classes of security flaws before they can be exploited. This allows human developers and project maintainers to dedicate more of their time to building features and improving software functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system operates by leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of Google’s recent Gemini Deep Think models. This foundation allows the agent to debug and resolve complex security issues with a high degree of autonomy. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a set of tools that permit it to analyse and reason about code before implementing any changes. CodeMender also includes a validation process to ensure any modifications are correct and do not introduce new problems, known as regressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While large language models are advancing rapidly, a mistake <a href=\"https://www.developer-tech.com/news/ai-pushes-code-faster-but-into-a-bottleneck-of-risks/\">when it comes to code security</a> can have costly consequences. CodeMender’s automatic validation framework is therefore essential. It systematically checks that any proposed changes fix the root cause of an issue, are functionally correct, do not break existing tests, and adhere to the project&#8217;s coding style guidelines. Only high-quality patches that satisfy these stringent criteria are surfaced for human review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance its code fixing effectiveness, the DeepMind team developed new techniques for the AI agent. CodeMender employs advanced program analysis, utilising a suite of tools including static and dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers. These instruments allow it to systematically scrutinise code patterns, control flow, and data flow to identify the fundamental causes of security flaws and architectural weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also uses a multi-agent architecture, where specialised agents are deployed to tackle specific aspects of a problem. For example, a dedicated large language model-based critique tool reveals the differences between original and modified code. This allows the primary agent to verify that its proposed changes do not introduce unintended side effects and to self-correct its approach when necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one practical example, CodeMender addressed a vulnerability where a crash report indicated a heap buffer overflow. Although the final patch only required changing a few lines of code, the root cause was not immediately obvious. By using a debugger and code search tools, the agent determined the true problem was an incorrect stack management issue with Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements during parsing, located elsewhere in the codebase. In another case, the agent devised a non-trivial patch for a complex object lifetime issue, modifying a custom system for generating C code within the target project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond simply reacting to existing bugs, CodeMender is designed to proactively harden software against future threats. The team deployed the agent to apply <em>-fbounds-safety</em> annotations to parts of libwebp, a widely used image compression library. These annotations instruct the compiler to add bounds checks to the code, which can prevent an attacker from exploiting a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This work is particularly relevant given that a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libwebp, tracked as CVE-2023-4863, was used by a threat actor in a zero-click iOS exploit several years ago. DeepMind notes that with these annotations in place, that specific vulnerability, along with most other buffer overflows in the annotated sections, would have been rendered unexploitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI agent’s proactive code fixing involves a sophisticated decision-making process. When applying annotations, it can automatically correct new compilation errors and test failures that arise from its own changes. If its validation tools detect that a modification has broken functionality, the agent self-corrects based on the feedback and attempts a different solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these promising early results, Google DeepMind is taking a cautious and deliberate approach to deployment, with a strong focus on reliability. At present, every patch generated by CodeMender is reviewed by human researchers before being submitted to an open-source project. The team is gradually increasing its submissions to ensure high quality and to systematically incorporate feedback from the open-source community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, the researchers plan to reach out to maintainers of critical open-source projects with CodeMender-generated patches. By iterating on community feedback, they hope to eventually release CodeMender as a publicly available tool for all software developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DeepMind team also intends to publish technical papers and reports in the coming months to share their techniques and results.

As supporters cheered in waves of blue and white, capturing moments on their phones and sharing videos (despite the crushing crowd density), China Mobile Shanghai&#8217;s newly deployed 5G-A network monetisation strategy was being tested in real-time, powered by Huawei&#8217;s GainLeap solution and intelligent wireless infrastructure.</p>\n<p>From the media section, the scale of the technical challenge became apparent – ensuring 80,000 simultaneous users could stream, upload, and transact without network degradation. This was something that required more than additional bandwidth.</p>\n<p>China Mobile Shanghai has become the first carrier in China to launch a differentiated 5G-A experience package, marking what industry observers see as a shift in how telecom operators might address revenue growth in saturated markets.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;5G-A Exclusive Package for Shenhua Football Fans&#8221; is a way to transform the elastic capabilities of 5G-Advanced networks into tangible value that users can perceive and are willing to pay for.</p>\n<p>The technical foundation for this 5G-A network monetisation strategy relies heavily on Huawei&#8217;s technology portfolio, from the GainLeap solution that identifies premium subscribers, to the AI-powered intelligent wireless boards that optimise network performance.</p>\n<h3>The business model innovation</h3>\n<p>The partnership between China Mobile Shanghai and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club offers approximately 200,000 football fans an annual package that combines network performance guarantees with fan-specific benefits.</p>\n<p>Subscribers receive network acceleration on 5G-A, access to all matches via the Migu streaming service, unlimited video ringback tone downloads, and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club merchandise.</p>\n<p>This approach to 5G-A network monetisation addresses what China Mobile Shanghai identifies as an important pain point for the telecommunications industry: how to drive quality growth when user acquisition has reached its ceiling. Rather than competing solely on price or basic connectivity, the package creates value through enhanced experiences in specific use-cases.</p>\n<h3>The technical infrastructure behind the experience</h3>\n<p>For Shanghai Stadium, China Mobile Shanghai implemented an elastic, scalable network capable of handling massive concurrent demand. During the match, with 80,000 users accessing the network simultaneously, 5G-A package subscribers can achieve download speeds of up to 600 Mbps.</p>\n<p>The necessary technical foundation relies on Huawei&#8217;s GainLeap solution, which lets the network identify 5G-A subscribers and allocates them a high-speed 3CC (three-component carrier) channel. The differentiation is key to the 5G-A network monetisation model – creating measurable performance differences between standard and premium subscribers.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Huawei&#8217;s AI-powered intelligent wireless boards play a central role. They integrate on-board communications capabilities with artificial intelligence to perceive network service types, user experience goals, device characteristics, and resource status, in milliseconds.</p>\n<p>According to test data provided by China Mobile Shanghai, they have helped result in QR code scanning latency reduced by 47%, WeChat uploading time shortened by 25%, live streaming speeds increased by 27%, and high-definition video ratios increased by 11%.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure deployment scale</h3>\n<p>To support the high concurrent demand during events, China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei conducted comprehensive network upgrades at the stadium. The lower stands received 32 new 2.6 GHz and 4.9 GHz pRRUs (passive remote radio units), more than doubling overall network capacity. Seven escalator entrances each received a 4.9 GHz EM device to eliminate coverage dead spots.</p>\n<p>On match days, more than 40 engineers are stationed onsite for real-time network monitoring and dynamic optimisation. Outside of the stadium, China Mobile Shanghai has achieved continuous 5G-A coverage in the area inside Shanghai&#8217;s Outer Ring Road, the five new towns further out, and 21 metro lines in the city.</p>\n<h3>The practical user experience</h3>\n<p>For fans at the match, the differentiated service manifested practically. The high bandwidth and business-level assurance capabilities enabled quick mobile payments for drinks, snacks, and souvenirs onsite. Users could share video highlights in real time without lag, even during peak moments when thousands of fans uploaded data simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The ability to instantly see likes and comments from friends while still in the stadium represents the kind of enhanced experience that China Mobile Shanghai is betting users will value enough to pay a premium for. Whether this bet pays off commercially remains to be seen, but the technical execution at the September 21 match demonstrated that the infrastructure delivers on its promises.</p>\n<h3>Industry implications</h3>\n<p>The initiative raises questions about the future of 5G-A network monetisation strategies in the telecommunications industry. Traditional models have struggled to justify the massive infrastructure investments required for 5G and latterly, 5G-Advanced networks. By creating tiered experiences tied to specific user communities – in this case, football fans – carriers may have found a way to differentiate services beyond simple speed tiers.</p>\n<p>The approach also represents a test case for how deeply integrated AI capabilities in network infrastructure can enable new business models. The intelligent wireless boards&#8217; ability to make millisecond-level decisions about resource allocation is what makes the performance differentiation technically feasible at scale.</p>\n<p>China Mobile Shanghai&#8217;s target of serving 200,000 Shenhua fans provides a measurable benchmark for assessing commercial viability.</p>\n<p>As telecommunications companies globally grapple with how to monetise increasingly expensive network upgrades, China Mobile Shanghai&#8217;s experiment with community-specific, experience-based packages may offer insights for the industry&#8217;s evolution beyond traditional connectivity provision.</p>\n<p><em>(Image source: Smart Shanghai </em>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

One group of subjects was allowed to use AI (ChatGPT was chosen; researchers considered there was little difference between it and its competitors), the second permitted to use Google Search, and the third group was termed &#8216;brain only&#8217; – that is, producing work with no technology aids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) was used on all the subjects to monitor brain activity to asses cognitive engagement and load. The researchers found that the groups exhibited different levels of neural connectivity, which reflected different strategies employed by the brain to write up the assignments. The more support the subjects had, the less hard their brains seemed to work. EEG analysis showed that the most active grey matter belonged to the unaided group, with less neural activity in the &#8216;search engine group&#8217;, and least of all among the AI users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study also examined what it termed &#8216;ownership&#8217; – the ability for the authors to quote what they had written afterwards and summarise their work. Levels of ownership fell dramatically with the more help the subjects received from technology. Few students using an LLM were able to reliably quote what they had written. Additionally, the LLM-using group &#8220;produced statistically homogeneous essays within each topic, showing significantly less deviation compared to the other groups.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the visual cortex of those using a search engine or ChatGPT was more active, with those groups &#8220;more inclined to focus on the output of the tools they were using,&#8221; the paper states.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-longer-term-effects\"><a></a><a></a> Longer-term effects</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After several rounds of essay-writing, two more groups were formed from the participating subjects, comprising of &#8216;Brain-to-LLM&#8217; and &#8216;LLM-to-Brain&#8217;, which as the names suggest, were subjects that had previously had no technological aids now able to use an LLM, and LLM users henceforth instructed to complete assignments &#8216;solo.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers found that, &#8220;LLM-to-Brain participants showed weaker neural connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks; and the Brain-to-LLM participants demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‑engagement of widespread occipito-parietal and prefrontal nodes. […] This suggests that AI-supported re-engagement invoked high levels of cognitive integration, memory reactivation, and top-down control.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, humans using their brains to tackle a subject can benefit from using an AI <em>after</em> they have already fully-explored their thoughts, experience, knowledge, and feelings without using technology. But those using AI from the outset show reduced brain activity over time, and were less able to perform cognitive tasks when asked to go ChatGPT-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper states, &#8220;As we demonstrated over the course of four months, the LLM group&#8217;s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, [and] scoring.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limited-study\"><a></a><a></a> Limited study</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With only a few dozen subjects in the study, the research group were working with a limited sample. The authors admit it will be necessary to use more volunteers that have a more diverse range of backgrounds for more statistically-reliable findings to be uncovered. Yet as AI is used increasingly in schools, colleges, and everyday life, the researchers have highlighted what they term a &#8220;pressing matter&#8221; of a &#8220;likely decrease in learning skills&#8221; that come about as a result of using AI as a replacement for humans&#8217; brains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusions\"><a></a><a></a> Conclusions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the trend of using ChatGPT in place of the very human activities of thinking, considering, and summarising continues, it seems likely that the ability to think effectively will diminish into the longer term. Having an AI add context or additional material later in any process of intellectual consideration produces better results than its use from the outset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engine use fell into the middle ground between unaided thought and being spoon-fed AI-generated materials, according to the paper. However the need by Google, Microsoft, <em>et al.</em> to insert AI-generation into users&#8217; search results (LLM results appearing uppermost on SERPs [search engine results pages]) means that cognitive activity among everyday search users may decline, should they only focus on AI-generated search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research group states that more study is required to understand the long-term effects of AIs on the brain, &#8220;before LLMs are recognised as something that is net positive for […] humans.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Image source: &#8220;Cognitive testing&#8221; by Nestlé is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&#038;utm_medium=Footer-banner&#038;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\"></a>\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Every transaction, interaction, and workflow runs on a web app, mobile interface, or API. That central role has made applications one of the most attractive and frequently-targeted points of entry for attackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As software grows more complex, spanning microservices, third-party libraries, and AI-powered functionality, so do the security risks. Traditional scanning methods struggle to keep up with rapid release cycles and distributed architectures. This has opened the door for AI-driven application security tools, which bring automation, pattern recognition, and predictive capabilities to a field that once relied heavily on manual reviews and static checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-best-practices-for-using-ai-appsec-tools\">Best practices for using AI AppSec tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the most value from AI-powered application security, teams should follow some key best practices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Shift security left:</strong> Integrate tools early in the SDLC so issues are caught before production.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Combine approaches:</strong> Use AI tools alongside traditional SAST, DAST, and manual reviews to cover all bases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enable continuous learning:</strong> Choose solutions that improve over time by ingesting threat intelligence and user feedback.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep humans in the loop:</strong> AI should augment, not replace, human judgment. Security experts are still needed for complex decision-making.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Align with compliance:</strong> Ensure AI-powered findings can be mapped to regulatory requirements like SOC 2, HIPAA, or GDPR.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-5-best-ai-powered-appsec-tools-of-2025\">The 5 best AI-powered AppSec tools of 2025</h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.

Its capabilities extend far beyond detection, enabling rapid, automated, and context-rich remediation that saves engineering time and reduces business exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Burp Suite</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burp Suite has long been a foundational tool for web application security professionals, but its latest AI-driven evolution makes it essential for defending cutting-edge app landscapes. Today, Burp Suite combines traditional manual penetration testing strengths with sophisticated machine learning, delivering smarter scanning and deeper insight than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where legacy DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools might struggle with modern, dynamic, or API-rich applications, Burp Suite&#8217;s AI modules adapt to changes in real time, learning from traffic patterns and user behaviours to uncover anomalies and hard-to-spot vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. PentestGPT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PentestGPT represents the future of automated offensive security, using generative AI to simulate the tactics of contemporary adversaries. Unlike pattern-based scanners, PentestGPT can devise new attack paths, generate custom payloads, and think creatively about bypassing controls and protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PentestGPT blends autonomous testing with educational support: security analysts, testers, and developers can interact with the platform conversationally, gaining hands-on guidance for complex scenarios and real-world exploit development.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Garak</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garak is an emerging leader specialising in security for AI-driven applications, specifically, large language models, generative agents, and their integration into wider software systems. As organisations increasingly embed AI into customer interactions, business logic, and automation, new risks have arisen that traditional AppSec tools simply weren&#8217;t built to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garak is designed to probe and harden these AI-infused interfaces, ensuring models respond safely and preventing AI-specific exploits like prompt injections and privacy breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-core-features-of-ai-driven-appsec-tools\">Core features of AI-driven AppSec tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While not every solution offers the same features, most AI-powered application security tools share several core capabilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Intelligent vulnerability detection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI models trained on massive datasets of known exploits can spot coding errors, misconfigurations, and insecure dependencies more accurately than static rule-based tools. They adapt over time, improving detection with each new dataset.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Automated remediation guidance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major pain points in AppSec is not just finding vulnerabilities but knowing how to fix them. AI tools can generate remediation advice tailored to the specific context, often offering code suggestions or step-by-step fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Continuous monitoring and real-time analysis</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of one-time scans, AI-powered tools continuously monitor applications in production. They analyse runtime behaviour, API calls, and data flows to spot anomalies that could indicate an active attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.

The experiment should serve as a stern reality check. As disruptive as phishing has been over the years, AI<a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/many-organisations-unprepared-ai-cybersecurity-threats/\"> is transforming it</a> into a faster, cheaper, and more effective threat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2026,<a href=\"https://hoxhunt.com/blog/ai-phishing-attacks\"> AI phishing detection needs to become</a> a top priority for companies looking to be safer in an increasingly complex threat environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-emergence-of-ai-phishing-as-a-major-threat\">The emergence of AI phishing as a major threat</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One major driver is the rise of Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS). Dark web platforms like Lighthouse and Lucid offer subscription-based kits that allow low-skilled criminals to launch sophisticated campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/17500-phishing-domains-target-316.html\">Recent reports</a> suggest that these services have generated more than 17,500 phishing domains in 74 countries, targeting hundreds of global brands. In just 30 seconds, criminals can spin up cloned login portals for services like Okta, Google, or Microsoft that are virtually the same as the real thing. With phishing infrastructure now available on demand, the barriers to entry for cybercrime are almost non-existent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, generative AI tools allow criminals to craft convincing and personalised phishing emails in seconds. The emails aren&#8217;t generic spam. By scraping data from LinkedIn, websites, or past breaches, AI tools create messages that mirror real business context, enticing the most careful employees to click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The technology is also fuelling<a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/how-to-safeguard-your-business-ai-generated-deepfakes/\"> a boom in deepfake audio and video</a> phishing. Over the past decade, deepfake-related attacks have increased by 1,000%. Criminals typically impersonate CEOs, family members, and trusted colleagues over communication channels like Zoom, WhatsApp and Teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-traditional-defences-aren-t-getting-it-done\">Traditional defences aren&#8217;t getting it done</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Signature-based detection used by traditional email filters are insufficient against AI-powered phishing. Threat actors can easily rotate their infrastructure,<a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/4055796/why-domain-based-attacks-will-continue-to-wreak-havoc.html\"> including domains</a>, subject lines, and other unique variations that slip past static security measures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the phish makes it to the inbox, it&#8217;s now up to the employee to decide whether to trust it. Unfortunately, given how convincing today&#8217;s AI phishing emails are, chances are that even a well-trained employee will eventually make a mistake. Spot-checking for poor grammar is a thing of the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the sophistication of phishing campaigns may not be the main threat. The sheer scale of the attacks is what is most worrying. Criminals can now launch thousands of new domains and cloned sites in a matter of hours. Even if one wave is taken down, another quickly replaces it, ensuring a constant stream of fresh threats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a perfect AI storm that requires a more strategic approach to deal with. What worked against yesterday&#8217;s crude phishing attempts is no match for the sheer scale and sophistication of modern campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-key-strategies-for-ai-phishing-detection\">Key strategies for AI phishing detection</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As cybersecurity experts and governing bodies often advise, a multi-layer approach is best for everything cybersecurity, including detecting AI phishing attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first line of defence is better threat analysis. Rather than static filters that rely on potentially outdated threat intelligence, NLP models trained on legitimate communication patterns can catch subtle deviations in tone, phrasing, or structure that a trained human might miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no amount of automation can replace the value of employee security awareness. It&#8217;s very likely that some AI phishing emails will eventually find their way to the inbox, so having a well-trained workforce is necessary for detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many methods for security awareness training. Simulation-based training is the most effective, because it keeps employees prepared for what AI phishing actually looks like. Modern simulations go beyond simple &#8220;spot the typo&#8221; training. They mirror real campaigns tied to the user&#8217;s role so that employees are prepared for the exact type of attacks they are most likely to face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal isn&#8217;t to test employees, but to build muscle memory so reporting suspicious activity comes naturally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final layer of defense is UEBA (User and Entity Behaviour Analytics), which ensures that a successful phishing attempt doesn&#8217;t result in a full-scale compromise. UEBA systems detect unusual user or system activities to warn defenders about a potential intrusion. Usually, this is in the form of an alert, perhaps about a login from an unexpected location, or unusual mailbox changes that aren&#8217;t in line with IT policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is advancing and scaling phishing to levels that can easily overwhelm or bypass traditional defences. Heading into 2026, organisations must prioritise AI-driven detection, continuous monitoring, and realistic simulation training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Success will depend on combining advanced technology with human readiness. Those that can strike this balance are well positioned to be more resilient as phishing attacks continue to evolve with AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Image source: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/teal-led-panel-EUsVwEOsblE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/why-ai-phishing-detection-will-define-cybersecurity-in-2026/\">Why AI phishing detection will define cybersecurity in 2026</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com\">AI News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Google: EU&#8217;s AI adoption lags China amid regulatory hurdles</title>\n\t\t<link>https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-eu-ai-adoption-lags-china-amid-regulatory-hurdles/</link>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Ryan Daws]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Wed, 01 Oct 2025 09:54:47 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI and Us]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI in Action]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Features]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Governance, Regulation & Policy]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Government & Public Sector AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Human-AI Relationships]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Inside AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[adoption]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[ai]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[artificial intelligence]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[eu]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[europe]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[geopolitics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[google]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[governance]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[government]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[politics]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[regulation]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/?p=109673</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>Google’s President of Global Affairs, Kent Walker, has urged the EU to increase AI adoption through a smarter regulatory approach amid increasing competition, particularly from China.

The Google and Alphabet executive stressed that the stakes are incredibly high for the continent&#8217;s future prosperity and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While acknowledging European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ursula-von-der-leyen-ai-race-is-far-from-over/\">recent assertion</a> that getting AI right is essential, Walker pointed to a concerning adoption deficit in the EU. He highlighted intense geopolitical competition and how government investment in China is fuelling integration of AI across its economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The strategy is paying off,” Walker stated. “The latest estimates suggest up to 83% of Chinese companies are already using generative AI. Meanwhile, the European Commission estimates that European adoption is hovering at around 14%.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Walker, this AI adoption lag is exacerbated by a regulatory environment that EU companies find increasingly difficult to navigate. He noted that since 2019, over one hundred new EU regulations have targeted the digital economy, leading to a situation where “more than 60% of Europe’s businesses now say regulation is their biggest obstacle to investment in the EU.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sentiment is backed by a recent Danish government study which estimated new regulations could impose an additional €124 billion in annual costs on businesses and public administration in Europe. Walker also pointed to the slow progress on implementing Mario Draghi’s recommendations on EU competitiveness, with only 11.2% of his ideas having been adopted a year on. Citing an International Monetary Fund study, he remarked on the fragmentation within the Single Market, where internal barriers create the equivalent of a 45% tariff on goods and a staggering 110% tariff on services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to these challenges, the Google executive proposed a direct, three-part strategy for the EU to reclaim its AI footing: laying a foundation of smart policy, building out adoption through workforce skilling, and scaling up to support widespread innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foundational step, Walker argued, requires a simplification of the AI regulatory landscape to create a framework supportive of innovation like China, but while ensuring regulation that is focused, aligned, and balanced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Regulating in ways that support AI innovation means focusing on the real-world effects of AI,” he explained. This approach involves filling specific regulatory gaps rather than implementing sweeping rules that could stifle beneficial and lower-risk applications. He urged regulators to “oversee outputs, not inputs—to manage risks and consequences, not micromanage science.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An aligned regulatory framework would apply existing regulations where appropriate and harmonise international standards, allowing providers to offer their best and latest AI models to EU citizens and companies. Walker also emphasised the need to design rules that not only prevent harm but also actively nurture innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google, he affirmed, remains a committed partner in Europe; with 30,000 employees and <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-announces-uk-data-centre-meet-growing-demand-ai/\">large infrastructure</a> investments, including seven data centres and thirteen cloud regions. He noted that the European Commission is currently seeking input to shape this agenda and encouraged businesses to share their views before the 14 October deadline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the strategy focuses on building out AI adoption in the EU by equipping people and companies to use these rapidly advancing tools. Walker illustrated the pace of change by revealing that Google’s new AI models are now “300x more efficient than the state-of-the-art from just two years ago.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To ensure citizens are not left behind, he championed public-private partnerships to accelerate skills training. He mentioned Google&#8217;s work over the last decade to help over 14 million Europeans learn digital skills and its €15 million AI Opportunity Fund, which supports vulnerable people in gaining foundational AI knowledge. While companies can initiate AI pilot projects, he stressed that it is the role of governments to scale up the most successful examples, similar to what China is doing for its economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building trust is also central to increasing AI adoption in the EU. Walker explained how Google’s Sovereign Cloud and AI solutions provide EU customers with full control over their data, ensuring it is managed according to local regulatory requirements and European values through partnerships with leaders like Thales in France and Schwarz Group in Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Walker described the third stage: scaling up. He sought to move the conversation beyond chatbots, which he described as “just a tiny part of its potential,” and towards the scientific breakthroughs AI is enabling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He provided powerful examples already in motion, such as Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold, which has created a database of nearly every protein known to science, now used by over three million researchers worldwide. This tool is helping scientists at the University of Malta better understand the genetic causes of osteoporosis. Another tool, GNoME, is transforming materials science by discovering hundreds of thousands of new materials with potential applications <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/study-finds-ai-slash-global-carbon-emissions/\">in energy</a>, transport, and clean water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walker concluded with a direct call to action, reiterating that the tools are ready and the potential is clear. “European leaders say AI leadership is at the top of their agenda—and it’s time to make those ambitions a reality,” he urged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Google exec finished by stating that this can be achieved by clearing regulatory hurdles for innovators, accelerating research through partnership, and scaling the adoption of AI tools to ignite a new era of EU growth and compete against geopolitical rivals like China.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/value-gap-ai-investments-widening-dangerously-fast/\"><strong>The value gap from AI investments is widening dangerously fast</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109669\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

In sharp contrast, 60 percent are failing to achieve any material value, reporting only minimal gains despite making substantial investments in the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“AI is reshaping the business landscape far faster than previous technology waves,” said Nicolas de Bellefonds , a managing director and senior partner and global leader of BCG’s AI efforts, and a coauthor of the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The companies that are capturing real value from AI aren’t just automating—they’re reshaping and reinventing how their businesses work. And they’re pulling away.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-performing organisations, which BCG labels &#8220;future-built,&#8221; aren’t just succeeding; they are creating a formidable and widening AI value gap. They already generate 1.7 times more revenue growth and 1.6 times higher EBIT margins than the lagging majority. This elite group has moved beyond isolated experiments to fundamentally reinvent their operations, driving shareholder returns through revenue increases and measurable workflow improvements. The remaining 35 percent of companies are making efforts to scale up but admit they are not moving fast enough to keep pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Future-built companies, having reaped early rewards, are now reinvesting their gains to pull even further ahead. They plan to spend 26 percent more on IT and dedicate 64 percent more of their IT budget to AI in 2025. This results in an overall AI investment that is 120 percent higher than their slower competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a consequence, future-built companies expect to see double the revenue increases and 1.4 times greater cost reductions from their AI applications. For the laggards, who lack foundational capabilities and generate almost no value, this creates what BCG calls a &#8220;vicious cycle of losing ground.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A key reason for this disparity is a failure of leadership. Among lagging firms, top management often delegates AI strategy to middle or lower management, fails to articulate a clear vision for value from investments, and spreads resources too thinly across disconnected initiatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret to success lies in a proven playbook followed by the leading five percent. These firms approach AI as a board and CEO-sponsored multiyear programme with ambitious, clearly defined targets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly all C-level leaders in future-built organisations are deeply engaged with AI, compared to only eight percent in lagging companies. They foster a model of shared ownership between business and IT departments, a practice they are 1.5 times more likely to adopt than their peers. One senior retail executive told BCG they &#8220;concentrate in particular on senior sponsorship and ownership of AI benefits by the businesses, which creates the room to invest.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These leaders are not merely automating existing processes. They focus on reshaping and inventing core business workflows where the majority of value lies. The report found that 70 percent of AI&#8217;s potential value is concentrated in core functions such as R&amp;D, sales, marketing, and manufacturing. Future-built companies prioritise this reinvention, resulting in 62 percent of their AI initiatives already being deployed, compared to just 12 percent for the laggards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An accelerator of the value gap is the emergence and investment in agentic AI – which combines predictive and generative capabilities – allowing it to &#8220;reason, learn, and act autonomously&#8221; with minimal human input. These AI agents can be seen as digital workers, capable of handling complex workflows from supply chain management to customer service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While hardly discussed in 2024, agentic AI already accounts for 17 percent of total AI value in 2025 and is projected to almost double to 29 percent by 2028. The top firms are moving quickly, with a third already using agents, compared to almost none of the laggards. These leaders are prioritising customer experience use cases for agents, with customer service being the top focus for 50 percent of companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Agentic AI isn’t a future concept—it’s already reshaping workflows and redefining roles. Companies should view it as the next step in scaling AI, not as the starting point,” said Amanda Luther , a managing director and senior partner at BCG and a coauthor of the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Agents represent a huge opportunity but aren’t simply plug-and-play: companies urgently need to redesign how work gets done, addressing the impact of agents on existing processes, roles, and skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talent is another key differentiator. Rather than focusing on job losses, future-built companies are aggressively upskilling their workforce to collaborate with AI. They plan to upskill more than 50 percent of their internal staff, making investments in broad-based employee AI enablement and carving out dedicated time for structured learning. This approach is six times more likely than in lagging companies. They also involve employees twice as often in the process of co-designing and reshaping workflows to incorporate AI agents, ensuring smoother adoption and building trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading organisations avoid the &#8220;GenAI burden&#8221; of siloed, unscalable proofs-of-concept by building on a central, integrated AI platform. They are three times more likely to operate such a platform, allowing them to build common capabilities for security and monitoring just once and then reuse them, accelerating deployment and ensuring enterprise-wide scale. More than half of these firms operate on a single, enterprise-wide data model, compared to just four percent of their stagnating peers, giving teams quick access to reliable and governed data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the 95 percent of companies falling behind, the message is urgent. The path to success is clearly delineated, but it requires a fundamental shift in mindset and organisation. BCG advises following a &#8220;10-20-70 rule,&#8221; where transformation efforts should focus 70 percent on people and processes, 20 percent on technology, and only 10 percent on the algorithms themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest roadblocks to achieving value from AI investments are not technical but organisational, relating to people, strategy, and processes. As the technology advances and the leaders accelerate, the window for catching up is closing fast. Firms that fail to act decisively now risk being permanently left behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/samsung-benchmarks-real-productivity-enterprise-ai-models/\"><strong>Samsung benchmarks real productivity of enterprise AI models</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo from TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109669\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

However, it&#8217;s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br>&nbsp;<br>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>&#8220;Automated Failure Attribution.&#8221;</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\"

Contributions</strong><br>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br>1.<strong> Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize &#8220;automated failure attribution&#8221; as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task&#8217;s failure.<br>2. <strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<br><strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<br><strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<br><strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Exploring Initial &#8220;Automated Attribution&#8221; Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br>&#8211; All-at-Once: This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br>&#8211; Step-by-Step: This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br>&#8211; Binary Search: A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong> <br>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:<br>&#8211; <strong>A Long Way to Go</strong>: Current methods are far from perfect. Even the best-performing single method achieved an accuracy of only about <strong>53.5%</strong> in identifying the responsible agent and a mere <strong>14.2%</strong> in pinpointing the exact error step. Some methods performed even worse than random guessing, underscoring the difficulty of the task.<br>&#8211; <strong>No &#8220;All-in-One&#8221; Solution</strong>: Different methods excel at different aspects of the problem.

State-of-the-Art Models Struggle: </strong>Surprisingly, even the most advanced reasoning models, like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, find this task challenging.- This highlights the inherent difficulty of automated failure attribution, which demands a higher level of reasoning than what is required for more conventional tasks.<br>&#8211; <strong>The Importance of Explicit Reasoning</strong>:

However, contemporary robot navigation systems face significant challenges in diverse and complex indoor environments, exposing the limitations of traditional approaches. Addressing the fundamental questions of &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;, &#8220;Where am I going?&#8221;, and &#8220;How do I get there?&#8221;, ByteDance has developed Astra, an innovative dual-model architecture designed to overcome these traditional navigation bottlenecks and enable general-purpose mobile robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional navigation systems typically consist of multiple, smaller, and often rule-based modules to handle the core challenges of target localization, self-localization, and path planning. Target localization involves understanding natural language or image cues to pinpoint a destination on a map. Self-localization requires a robot to determine its precise position within a map, especially challenging in repetitive environments like warehouses where traditional methods often rely on artificial landmarks (e.g., QR codes). Path planning further divides into global planning for rough route generation and local planning for real-time obstacle avoidance and reaching intermediate waypoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While foundation models have shown promise in integrating smaller models to tackle broader tasks, the optimal number of models and their effective integration for comprehensive navigation remained an open question. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"243\" data-attachment-id=\"47239\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1183/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=1080%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=950%2C243&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=950%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47239\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C262&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=600%2C153&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ByteDance&#8217;s Astra, detailed in their paper &#8220;Astra: Toward General-Purpose Mobile Robots via Hierarchical Multimodal Learning&#8221; (website: <a href=\"https://astra-mobility.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://astra-mobility.github.io/</a>), addresses these limitations. Following the System 1/System 2 paradigm, Astra features two primary sub-models: <strong>Astra-Global</strong> and <strong>Astra-Local</strong>. Astra-Global handles low-frequency tasks like target and self-localization, while Astra-Local manages high-frequency tasks such as local path planning and odometry estimation. This architecture promises to revolutionize how robots navigate complex indoor spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"478\" data-attachment-id=\"47241\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1184/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=1080%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,543\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=950%2C478&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=950%2C478&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=600%2C302&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astra-Global: The Intelligent Brain for Global Localization</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Global serves as the intelligent core of the Astra architecture, responsible for critical low-frequency tasks: self-localization and target localization. It functions as a <strong>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)</strong>, adept at processing both visual and linguistic inputs to achieve precise global positioning within a map. Its strength lies in utilizing a <strong>hybrid topological-semantic graph</strong> as contextual input, allowing the model to accurately locate positions based on query images or text prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction of this robust localization system begins with <strong>offline mapping</strong>. The research team developed an offline method to build a hybrid topological-semantic graph G=(V,E,L):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>V (Nodes):</strong> Keyframes, obtained by temporal downsampling of input video and SfM-estimated 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) camera poses, act as nodes encoding camera poses and landmark references.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>E (Edges):</strong> Undirected edges establish connectivity based on relative node poses, crucial for global path planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>L (Landmarks):</strong> Semantic landmark information is extracted by Astra-Global from visual data at each node, enriching the map&#8217;s semantic understanding. These landmarks store semantic attributes and are connected to multiple nodes via co-visibility relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In practical localization, Astra-Global&#8217;s self-localization and target localization capabilities leverage a <strong>coarse-to-fine two-stage process</strong> for visual-language localization. The coarse stage analyzes input images and localization prompts, detects landmarks, establishes correspondence with a pre-built landmark map, and filters candidates based on visual consistency. The fine stage then uses the query image and coarse output to sample reference map nodes from the offline map, comparing their visual and positional information to directly output the predicted pose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"725\" data-attachment-id=\"47242\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1185/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=1080%2C824&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,824\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=950%2C725&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=950%2C725&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47242\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=1024%2C781&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=768%2C586&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=600%2C458&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>language-based target localization</strong>, the model interprets natural language instructions, identifies relevant landmarks using their functional descriptions within the map, and then leverages landmark-to-node association mechanisms to locate relevant nodes, retrieving target images and 6-DoF poses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To empower Astra-Global with robust localization abilities, the team employed a meticulous training methodology. Using <strong>Qwen2.5-VL</strong> as the backbone, they combined <strong>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)</strong> with <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong>. SFT involved diverse datasets for various tasks, including coarse and fine localization, co-visibility detection, and motion trend estimation. In the GRPO phase, a rule-based reward function (including format, landmark extraction, map matching, and extra landmark rewards) was used to train for visual-language localization. Experiments showed GRPO significantly improved Astra-Global&#8217;s zero-shot generalization, achieving 99.9% localization accuracy in unseen home environments, surpassing SFT-only methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astra-Local: The Intelligent Assistant for Local Planning</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Local acts as the intelligent assistant for Astra&#8217;s high-frequency tasks, a multi-task network capable of efficiently generating local paths and accurately estimating odometry from sensor data.

It begins with a <strong>3D spatial encoder</strong> that processes N omnidirectional images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) and Lift-Splat-Shoot to convert 2D image features into 3D voxel features. This 3D encoder is trained using self-supervised learning via 3D volumetric differentiable neural rendering. The 4D spatio-temporal encoder then builds upon the 3D encoder, taking past voxel features and future timestamps as input to predict future voxel features through ResNet and DiT modules, providing current and future environmental representations for planning and odometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>planning head</strong>, based on pre-trained 4D features, robot speed, and task information, generates executable trajectories using <strong>Transformer-based flow matching</strong>. To prevent collisions, the planning head incorporates a <strong>masked ESDF loss</strong> (Euclidean Signed Distance Field). This loss calculates the ESDF of a 3D occupancy map and applies a 2D ground truth trajectory mask, significantly reducing collision rates. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance in collision rate and overall score on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets compared to other methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>odometry head</strong> predicts the robot&#8217;s relative pose using current and past 4D features and additional sensor data (e.g., IMU, wheel data). It trains a Transformer model to fuse information from different sensors. Each sensor modality is processed by a specific tokenizer, combined with modality embeddings and temporal positional embeddings, fed into a Transformer encoder, and finally uses a CLS token to predict relative pose. Experiments showed the odometry head&#8217;s excellent performance in multi-sensor fusion and pose estimation, significantly improving rotational accuracy and reducing overall trajectory error.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Validation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Extensive experiments were conducted in diverse indoor environments (warehouses, offices, homes) to comprehensively evaluate Astra&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Global&#8217;s multimodal localization capabilities were validated through various experiments, demonstrating superior performance in handling text and image localization queries. For target localization, it accurately identifies matching images and poses based on text commands (e.g., &#8220;find the resting area&#8221;). Compared to traditional Visual Place Recognition (VPR) methods, Astra-Global exhibits significant advantages in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Detail Capture:</strong> Unlike VPR&#8217;s reliance on global features, Astra-Global precisely captures fine details like room numbers, preventing localization errors in similar scenes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Viewpoint Robustness:</strong> Based on semantic landmarks, Astra-Global maintains stable localization even with large camera angle changes, where VPR methods typically fail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pose Accuracy:</strong> Astra-Global leverages landmark spatial relationships to select the best matching pose, showing significantly higher pose accuracy (within 1-meter distance error and 5-degree angular error) than traditional VPR, with over 30% improvement in warehouse environments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

planning and odometry heads were thoroughly evaluated. The planning head, using Transformer-based flow matching and masked ESDF loss, outperformed methods like ACT and diffusion policies in collision rate, speed, and overall score on OOD datasets. This highlights the masked ESDF loss&#8217;s effectiveness in mitigating collision risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odometry head&#8217;s performance was assessed on multimodal datasets including synchronized image sequences, IMU, wheel data, and ground truth poses. Compared to two-frame BEV-ODOM baselines, Astra-Local&#8217;s odometry head showed significant advantages in multi-sensor fusion and pose estimation. Integrating IMU data dramatically improved rotational estimation accuracy, reducing overall trajectory error to approximately 2%. Further inclusion of wheel data enhanced scale stability and estimation accuracy, validating its superior multi-sensor data fusion capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra holds significant promise for future development and applications. Its deployment can be expanded to more complex indoor environments like large shopping malls, hospitals, and libraries, where it can assist in tasks such as precise product location, efficient medical supply delivery, and book organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, areas for improvement exist. For Astra-Global, while current map representations balance information loss and token length, they may occasionally lack critical semantic details. Future work will focus on alternative map compression methods to optimize efficiency while maximizing semantic information retention. Additionally, current single-frame localization can fail in feature-scarce or highly repetitive environments; future plans include active exploration mechanisms and temporal reasoning for more robust localization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Astra-Local, improving robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is crucial, requiring enhanced model architectures and training methods. Redesigning the fallback system for tighter integration and seamless switching is also planned to improve system stability. Furthermore, integrating instruction-following capabilities will enable robots to understand and execute natural language commands, expanding their usability in dynamic, human-centric environments and fostering more natural human-robot interaction.</p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/\">ByteDance Introduces Astra: A Dual-Model Architecture for Autonomous Robot Navigation</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>27</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47236</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MIT Researchers Unveil &#8220;SEAL&#8221;: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</title>\n\t\t<link>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Synced]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:58:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://syncedreview.com/?p=47227</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>MIT introduces SEAL, a framework enabling large language models to self-edit and update their weights via reinforcement learning.</p>\nThe post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/\">MIT Researchers Unveil “SEAL”: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of AI self-improvement has been a hot topic in recent research circles, with a flurry of papers emerging and prominent figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighing in on the future of self-evolving intelligent systems. Now, a new paper from MIT, titled &#8220;Self-Adapting Language Models,&#8221; introduces <strong>SEAL (Self-Adapting LLMs)</strong>, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to update their own weights. This development is seen as another significant step towards the realization of truly self-evolving AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research paper, published yesterday, has already ignited considerable discussion, including on Hacker News. SEAL proposes a method where an LLM can generate its own training data through &#8220;self-editing&#8221; and subsequently update its weights based on new inputs. Crucially, this self-editing process is learned via reinforcement learning, with the reward mechanism tied to the updated model&#8217;s downstream performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MGQwYzg0MGE5ZDk3ZWNhOTFiZGJmOGM5MWFhZmU3ZjZfVEJVbjJ5U3o5TEgxeTVEZjZwWkozdE5PZGozeTN3dnZfVG9rZW46RjJvS2JFMUZWb0NIV0N4S1pCeGMzZFg4blVlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of this paper is particularly notable given the recent surge in interest surrounding AI self-evolution. Earlier this month, several other research efforts garnered attention, including Sakana AI and the University of British Columbia&#8217;s &#8220;Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM),&#8221; CMU&#8217;s &#8220;Self-Rewarding Training (SRT),&#8221; Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#8217;s &#8220;MM-UPT&#8221; framework for continuous self-improvement in multimodal large models, and the &#8220;UI-Genie&#8221; self-improvement framework from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in collaboration with vivo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the buzz, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently shared his vision of a future with self-improving AI and robots in his blog post, &#8220;The Gentle Singularity.&#8221; He posited that while the initial millions of humanoid robots would need traditional manufacturing, they would then be able to &#8220;operate the entire supply chain to build more robots, which can in turn build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, and so on.&#8221; This was quickly followed by a tweet from @VraserX, claiming an OpenAI insider revealed the company was already running recursively self-improving AI internally, a claim that sparked widespread debate about its veracity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the specifics of internal OpenAI developments, the MIT paper on SEAL provides concrete evidence of AI&#8217;s progression towards self-evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding SEAL: Self-Adapting Language Models</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The core idea behind SEAL is to enable language models to improve themselves when encountering new data by generating their own synthetic data and optimizing their parameters through self-editing. The model&#8217;s training objective is to directly generate these self-edits (SEs) using data provided within the model&#8217;s context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The generation of these self-edits is learned through reinforcement learning. The model is rewarded when the generated self-edits, once applied, lead to improved performance on the target task. Therefore, SEAL can be conceptualized as an algorithm with two nested loops: an outer reinforcement learning (RL) loop that optimizes the generation of self-edits, and an inner update loop that uses the generated self-edits to update the model via gradient descent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method can be viewed as an instance of meta-learning, where the focus is on how to generate effective self-edits in a meta-learning fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=NDFkZjA3MDJjMzZjYWMyMDVhMDRmYmVhZGZjZWE5Y2ZfT0YzUldDMFE2c1g1YjVQaEhPdFBtdG45bjhqOTByWDNfVG9rZW46WTNBdmJwTTV0b0xCSlF4emhPS2NBVUU5bm9iXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A General Framework</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>SEAL operates on a single task instance (C,τ), where C is context information relevant to the task, and τ defines the downstream evaluation for assessing the model&#8217;s adaptation. For example, in a knowledge integration task, C might be a passage to be integrated into the model&#8217;s internal knowledge, and τ a set of questions about that passage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given C, the model generates a self-edit SE, which then updates its parameters through supervised fine-tuning: θ′←SFT(θ,SE). Reinforcement learning is used to optimize this self-edit generation: the model performs an action (generates SE), receives a reward r based on LMθ′&#8217;s performance on τ, and updates its policy to maximize the expected reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers found that traditional online policy methods like GRPO and PPO led to unstable training. They ultimately opted for ReST^EM, a simpler, filtering-based behavioral cloning approach from a DeepMind paper. This method can be viewed as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process, where the E-step samples candidate outputs from the current model policy, and the M-step reinforces only those samples that yield a positive reward through supervised fine-tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper also notes that while the current implementation uses a single model to generate and learn from self-edits, these roles could be separated in a &#8220;teacher-student&#8221; setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Instantiating SEAL in Specific Domains</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The MIT team instantiated SEAL in two specific domains: <strong>knowledge integration</strong> and <strong>few-shot learning</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Knowledge Integration:</strong> The goal here is to effectively integrate information from articles into the model&#8217;s weights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Few-Shot Learning:</strong> This involves the model adapting to new tasks with very few examples.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The experimental results for both few-shot learning and knowledge integration demonstrate the effectiveness of the SEAL framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>few-shot learning</strong>, using a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model, SEAL significantly improved adaptation success rates, achieving 72.5% compared to 20% for models using basic self-edits without RL training, and 0% without adaptation. While still below &#8220;Oracle TTT&#8221; (an idealized baseline), this indicates substantial progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MjE5YmIxODllMDlmMjc1MDRkOGM3MWVlNDhiNzlmOThfOVRqYW04NEN3UEtCT3ZmZUR0RFRZSTFSRFk5cTh3eW9fVG9rZW46U0dOOGIySVhQb0FzZzV4RjRmRmNRVnI5bjNlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>knowledge integration</strong>, using a larger Qwen2.5-7B model to integrate new facts from SQuAD articles, SEAL consistently outperformed baseline methods. Training with synthetically generated data from the base Qwen-2.5-7B model already showed notable improvements, and subsequent reinforcement learning further boosted performance. The accuracy also showed rapid improvement over external RL iterations, often surpassing setups using GPT-4.1 generated data within just two iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZDQwZTAyN2NmMjYyYjFhNDAyNGY2MTYyNDE2NmMwNGVfOFVHSHdtN2V5NEQ0MGFBdU9kSHJzcjlIQVVPalBtNHhfVG9rZW46VVBOUWJwM0pab0lNMGJ4R0s3NmNXUlAybkFlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualitative examples from the paper illustrate how reinforcement learning leads to the generation of more detailed self-edits, resulting in improved performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While promising, the researchers also acknowledge some limitations of the SEAL framework, including aspects related to catastrophic forgetting, computational overhead, and context-dependent evaluation. These are discussed in detail in the original paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Original Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Project Site: <a href=\"https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/\">MIT Researchers Unveil “SEAL”: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>28</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47227</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Researchers from PSU and Duke introduce &#8220;Multi-Agent Systems Automated Failure Attribution</title>\n\t\t<link>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/researchers-from-psu-and-duke-introduce-multi-agent-systems-automated-failure-attribution/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/researchers-from-psu-and-duke-introduce-multi-agent-systems-automated-failure-attribution/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Synced]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 07:39:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nature Language Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Share My Research]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://syncedreview.com/?p=47209</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\"Automated failure attribution\" is a crucial component in the development lifecycle of Multi-Agent systems.

However, it&#8217;s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br> <br>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br> <br>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>&#8220;Automated Failure Attribution.&#8221;</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.<br>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"602\"

when a system fails, developers are often left with manual and inefficient methods for debugging:<br><strong>Manual Log Archaeology</strong> : Developers must manually review lengthy interaction logs to find the source of the problem.<br><strong>Reliance on Expertise</strong> : The debugging process is highly dependent on the developer&#8217;s deep understanding of the system and the task at hand.<br> <br>This &#8220;needle in a haystack&#8221; approach to debugging is not only inefficient but also severely hinders rapid system iteration and the improvement of system reliability. There is an urgent need for an automated, systematic method to pinpoint the cause of failures, effectively bridging the gap between &#8220;evaluation results&#8221; and &#8220;system improvement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><br><strong>Core Contributions</strong><br>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br>1. <strong>Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize &#8220;automated failure attribution&#8221; as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task&#8217;s failure.<br><br><strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<br><em><strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<br><strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<br><strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Exploring Initial &#8220;Automated Attribution&#8221; Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br><strong>All-at-Once: </strong>This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br><strong>Binary Search: </strong>A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.<br><strong> </strong><br><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A Long Way to Go</strong>: Current methods are far from perfect.

promise for artificial intelligence, enabling agents to plan and reason in dynamic environments. Recent advancements, particularly with video diffusion models, have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic future sequences. However, a significant bottleneck remains: <strong>maintaining long-term memory.</strong> Current models struggle to remember events and states from far in the past due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences using traditional attention layers. This limits their ability to perform complex tasks requiring sustained understanding of a scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new paper, &#8220;Long-Context State-Space Video World Models&#8221; by researchers from Stanford University, Princeton University, and Adobe Research, proposes an innovative solution to this challenge. They introduce a novel architecture that leverages <strong>State-Space Models (SSMs)</strong> to extend temporal memory without sacrificing computational efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core problem lies in the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms with respect to sequence length. As the video context grows, the resources required for attention layers explode, making long-term memory impractical for real-world applications. This means that after a certain number of frames, the model effectively &#8220;forgets&#8221; earlier events, hindering its performance on tasks that demand long-range coherence or reasoning over extended periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors’ key insight is to leverage the inherent strengths of State-Space Models (SSMs) for causal sequence modeling. Unlike previous attempts that retrofitted SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, this work fully exploits their advantages in processing sequences efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed <strong>Long-Context State-Space Video World Model (LSSVWM)</strong> incorporates several crucial design choices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Block-wise SSM Scanning Scheme:</strong> This is central to their design. Instead of processing the entire video sequence with a single SSM scan, they employ a block-wise scheme. This strategically trades off some spatial consistency (within a block) for significantly extended temporal memory. By breaking down the long sequence into manageable blocks, they can maintain a compressed &#8220;state&#8221; that carries information across blocks, effectively extending the model&#8217;s memory horizon.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dense Local Attention:</strong> To compensate for the potential loss of spatial coherence introduced by the block-wise SSM scanning, the model incorporates dense local attention. This ensures that consecutive frames within and across blocks maintain strong relationships, preserving the fine-grained details and consistency necessary for realistic video generation. This dual approach of global (SSM) and local (attention) processing allows them to achieve both long-term memory and local fidelity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"586\" height=\"883\" data-attachment-id=\"47188\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1175/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"586,883\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=586%2C883&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47188\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?w=586&amp;ssl=1 586w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper also introduces two key training strategies to further improve long-context performance:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Diffusion Forcing:</strong> This technique encourages the model to generate frames conditioned on a prefix of the input, effectively forcing it to learn to maintain consistency over longer durations. By sometimes not sampling a prefix and keeping all tokens noised, the training becomes equivalent to diffusion forcing, which is highlighted as a special case of long-context training where the prefix length is zero. This pushes the model to generate coherent sequences even from minimal initial context.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Frame Local Attention:</strong> For faster training and sampling, the authors implemented a &#8220;frame local attention&#8221; mechanism. This utilizes FlexAttention to achieve significant speedups compared to a fully causal mask. By grouping frames into chunks (e.g., chunks of 5 with a frame window size of 10), frames within a chunk maintain bidirectionality while also attending to frames in the previous chunk. This allows for an effective receptive field while optimizing computational load.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"605\" height=\"729\" data-attachment-id=\"47189\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1176/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"605,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=605%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47189\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?w=605&amp;ssl=1 605w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1 249w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=600%2C723&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers evaluated their LSSVWM on challenging datasets, including <strong>Memory Maze</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong>, which are specifically designed to test long-term memory capabilities through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiments demonstrate that their approach <strong>substantially surpasses baselines</strong> in preserving long-range memory. Qualitative results, as shown in supplementary figures (e.g., S1, S2, S3), illustrate that LSSVWM can generate more coherent and accurate sequences over extended periods compared to models relying solely on causal attention or even Mamba2 without frame local attention. For instance, on reasoning tasks for the maze dataset, their model maintains better consistency and accuracy over long horizons. Similarly, for retrieval tasks, LSSVWM shows improved ability to recall and utilize information from distant past frames. Crucially, these improvements are achieved while maintaining practical inference speeds, making the models suitable for interactive applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"595\" height=\"339\" data-attachment-id=\"47190\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1177/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"595,339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=595%2C339&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47190\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paper<em> Long-Context State-Space Video World Models</em> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20171\" title=\"\">arXiv</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/\">Adobe Research Unlocking Long-Term Memory in Video World Models with State-Space Models</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>52</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47184</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DeepSeek-V3 New Paper is coming!

The paper moves beyond the architectural specifics of DeepSeek-V3 to explore how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address the limitations of current hardware, ultimately enabling cost-efficient large-scale training and inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AU-vFtGM354SLx9Rm.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Paper Insights into DeepSeek-V3: Scaling Challenges and Reflections on Hardware for AI Architectures is on arXiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6451\">The rapid scaling of LLMs has exposed critical bottlenecks in current hardware architectures, particularly concerning memory capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnect bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3, trained on a cluster of 2048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, serves as a compelling case study demonstrating how a synergistic approach between model design and hardware considerations can overcome these limitations. This research focuses on the interplay between hardware architecture and model design in achieving economical large-scale training and inference, aiming to provide actionable insights for efficiently scaling LLMs without compromising performance or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e9e4\">Key areas of focus in the paper include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hardware-Driven Model Design:</strong> Analyzing how hardware characteristics, such as FP8 low-precision computation and scale-up/scale-out network properties, influence architectural choices within DeepSeek-V3.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hardware-Model Interdependencies:</strong> Investigating how hardware capabilities shape model innovation and how the evolving demands of LLMs drive requirements for next-generation hardware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Future Directions for Hardware Development:</strong> Drawing practical insights from DeepSeek-V3 to guide the co-design of future hardware and model architectures for scalable and cost-effective AI systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"f3cf\">DeepSeek-V3’s Design Principles: Addressing Core Scaling Challenges</h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A-MtwoD3wGPIBwQYY.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7858\">DeepSeek-V3 incorporates several key architectural innovations, as illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper, including the DeepSeekMoE architecture and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). These designs directly tackle the core challenges of scaling LLMs: memory efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and inference speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abab\">Memory Efficiency: MLA and KV Cache Optimization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e0c2\">LLMs exhibit exponential growth in memory demands, outpacing the slower growth of high-speed memory like HBM. While multi-node parallelism offers a solution, optimizing memory usage at the source remains crucial. DeepSeek addresses this bottleneck with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), which employs projection matrices to compress the key-value (KV) representations of all attention heads into a smaller latent vector, trained jointly with the model. During inference, only this compressed latent vector needs to be cached, significantly reducing memory consumption compared to storing full KV caches for each head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"72c0\">Beyond MLA, DeepSeek highlights other valuable techniques for KV cache size reduction, providing inspiration for future advancements in memory-efficient attention mechanisms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Shared KV (GQA; MQA):</strong> Multiple attention heads share a single set of key-value pairs, drastically compressing storage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Window KV:</strong> Limiting the context window for KV caching.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quantization Compression:</strong> Reducing the precision of stored KV values.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"60fa\">Table 1 in the paper compares the per-token KV cache memory footprint of DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5 72B, and LLaMA-3.1 405B. DeepSeek-V3 achieves a remarkable reduction, requiring only 70 KB per token, significantly lower than LLaMA-3.1 405B’s 516 KB and Qwen-2.5 72B’s 327 KB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2Al0SsgV8-Q9V7A_HZ.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5af3\">Cost-Effectiveness: DeepSeekMoE for Sparse Computation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"075a\">For sparse computation, DeepSeek developed DeepSeekMoE, an advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (Figure 1, bottom right). MoE models offer two key advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduced Training Compute:</strong> By selectively activating a subset of expert parameters per token, MoE architectures allow for a substantial increase in the total number of parameters while maintaining manageable computational demands. For instance, DeepSeek-V3 boasts 671B parameters, nearly three times that of its predecessor V2 (236B), yet only activates 37B parameters per token. In contrast, dense models like Qwen2.5–72B and LLaMa3.1–405B require all parameters to be active during training. Table 2 demonstrates that DeepSeekV3 achieves comparable or superior performance to these dense models with an order of magnitude less computational cost (around 250 GFLOPS per token vs. 394 GFLOPS for the 72B dense model and 2448 GFLOPS for the 405B dense model).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantages for Personal Use and Local Deployment:</strong> The selective activation of parameters in MoE models translates to significantly lower memory and compute requirements during single-request inference. DeepSeek-V2 (236B parameters), for example, only activates 21B parameters during inference, enabling near or above 20 tokens per second (TPS) on AI SoC-equipped personal computers — a capability far exceeding that of similarly sized dense models on comparable hardware. This opens possibilities for personalized LLM agents running locally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A8N5gp31XFnPbEMjo.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4ae2\">Enhanced Inference Speed: Overlapping Computation and Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cd02\">DeepSeek prioritizes both system-level maximum throughput and single-request latency for inference speed. To maximize throughput, the model employs a dual micro-batch overlapping architecture from the outset, intentionally overlapping communication latency with computation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"76af\">Furthermore, DeepSeek decouples the computation of MLA and MoE into distinct stages. While one micro-batch performs part of the MLA or MoE computation, the other concurrently executes the corresponding scheduling communication. Conversely, during the second micro-batch’s computation phase, the first micro-batch undertakes the combine communication step. This pipelined approach enables seamless overlap of all-to-all communication with continuous computation, ensuring full GPU utilization. In production, DeepSeek utilizes a prefill and decode separation architecture, assigning large-batch prefill and latency-sensitive decode requests to different-sized expert-parallel groups, maximizing system throughput under real-world serving conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6953\">The paper also touches upon the importance of test-time scaling for reasoning models and highlights the critical role of high token output speed in reinforcement learning workflows and for reducing user-perceived latency in long inference sequences. Optimizing inference speed through hardware-software co-innovation is therefore paramount for the efficiency of reasoning models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a381\">Low-Precision Driven Design: FP8 Training and LogFMT</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"00fd\">FP8 Mixed-Precision Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9f4b\">While quantization techniques like GPTQ and AWQ have significantly reduced memory requirements primarily for inference, DeepSeek has pioneered the use of FP8 mixed-precision training for a large-scale MoE model. Despite NVIDIA’s Transformer Engine supporting FP8, DeepSeek-V3 marks a significant step as the first publicly known large model to leverage FP8 for training. This achievement, resulting from close collaboration between infrastructure and algorithm teams, along with extensive experimentation, significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining model quality, making large-scale training more feasible. Figure 1 illustrates the FP8 precision used in the forward and backward passes during training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"452f\">LogFMT for Efficient Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"57a1\">DeepSeek also employs low-precision compression for network communication within the DeepSeek-V3 architecture. During EP parallelism, tokens are scheduled using fine-grained FP8 quantization, reducing communication volume by 50% compared to BF16, thereby significantly shortening communication time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"73e8\">Beyond traditional floating-point formats, DeepSeek experimented with a novel data type called LogFMT-nBit (Logarithmic Floating-Point Formats).</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3a44\">Interconnect-Driven Design: Addressing Hardware Limitations</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6918\">Current Hardware Architecture and its Constraints</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"de6a\">DeepSeek currently utilizes the NVIDIA H800 GPU SXM architecture (Figure 2), which, while based on the Hopper architecture similar to the H100, features reduced FP64 compute performance and NVLink bandwidth (400 GB/s down from 900 GB/s in H100) due to regulatory requirements. This significant reduction in intra-node scaling bandwidth poses challenges for high-performance workloads. To compensate, each node is equipped with eight 400G Infiniband (IB) CX7 network interface cards (NICs) to enhance inter-node scaling capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2ArKo4pTKD63B5fbSU.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c1f8\">Hardware-Aware Parallelization and Model Co-design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2310\">To navigate the limitations of the H800 architecture, the DeepSeek-V3 model incorporates hardware-aware design considerations for parallelization, including: avoiding Tensor Parallelism (TP), enhancing Pipeline Parallelism (PP), and accelerating Expert Parallelism (EP). Specific details of these strategies are available in the original paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e3ec\">A key aspect of model co-design is “node-aware routing” for the TopK expert selection strategy in the MoE architecture. Given the approximately 4:1 bandwidth difference between intra-node (NVLink, ~160 GB/s effective) and inter-node (IB, ~40 GB/s effective per NIC) communication, DeepSeek designed the routing to leverage the higher intra-node bandwidth. By grouping the 256 routing experts (4 per GPU in an 8-node, 64-GPU setup) into 8 groups of 32 experts, each residing on a single node, and algorithmically ensuring that each token is routed to at most 4 nodes, DeepSeek mitigates the IB communication bottleneck and improves effective communication bandwidth during training. Tokens destined for experts on the same node can be sent via IB once and then forwarded via NVLink, reducing redundant IB traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8584\">Scale-Up and Scale-Out Convergence: Future Hardware Directions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e4f5\">While node-aware routing reduces bandwidth demands, the bandwidth disparity between NVLink and IB complicates the implementation of communication-intensive kernels. Currently, GPU Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) handle both network message processing and data forwarding via NVLink, consuming significant compute resources. DeepSeek advocates for integrating intra-node (scale-up) and inter-node (scale-out) communication into a unified framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bb45\">Integrating dedicated co-processors for network traffic management and seamless forwarding between NVLink and IB domains could reduce software complexity and maximize bandwidth utilization. Hardware support for dynamic traffic deduplication could further optimize strategies like DeepSeek-V3’s node-aware routing. DeepSeek also explores emerging interconnect protocols like Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) and Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink), noting the Unified Bus (UB) as a recent approach to converging scale-up and scale-out. The paper details methods for achieving this convergence at the programming framework level, including unified network adapters, dedicated communication co-processors, flexible forwarding and broadcast/reduce mechanisms, and hardware synchronization primitives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7303\">Bandwidth Contention and Latency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0faa\">Another limitation of current hardware is the lack of flexibility in dynamically allocating bandwidth between different traffic types on NVLink and PCIe. For instance, transferring KV cache data from CPU memory to GPUs during inference can saturate PCIe bandwidth, leading to contention with inter-GPU EP communication via IB, potentially degrading overall performance and causing latency spikes. DeepSeek suggests solutions including dynamic NVLink/PCIe traffic prioritization, I/O chiplet integration, and CPU-GPU interconnect within the scale-up domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3982\">Large-Scale Network-Driven Design: Multi-Plane Fat-Tree</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e8c0\">Network Co-design: Multi-Plane Fat-Tree</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fefd\">For DeepSeek-V3 training, a Multi-Plane Fat-Tree (MPFT) scale-out network was deployed (Figure 3). Each node, equipped with 8 GPUs and 8 IB NICs, assigns each GPU-NIC pair to a different network plane. Additionally, each node has a 400 Gbps Ethernet RoCE NIC connected to a separate storage network plane for accessing the 3FS distributed file system. The scale-out network utilizes 64-port 400G IB switches, theoretically supporting up to 16,384 GPUs while retaining the cost and latency advantages of a two-layer network. However, due to policy and regulatory constraints, the actual deployment involved over two thousand GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AOtuIGcZsxVrUTbvo.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"92c6\">The deployed MPFT network did not fully realize its intended architecture due to current limitations of the IB ConnectX-7. Ideally (Figure 4), each NIC would have multiple physical ports, each connected to a separate network plane but presented to the user as a single logical interface via port bonding. This would allow a single Queue Pair (QP) to seamlessly send and receive messages across all available ports, similar to packet spraying. Native out-of-order layout support within the NIC would be necessary to ensure message consistency and correct ordering semantics, as packets from the same QP might traverse different network paths and arrive out of order. InfiniBand ConnectX-8 natively supports four planes, and future NICs with full support for advanced multi-plane capabilities will significantly benefit the scalability of two-layer fat-tree networks for large AI clusters. Overall, multi-plane architectures offer significant advantages in fault isolation, robustness, load balancing, and scalability for large systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A8ibInf8M-5okJZ_g.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3347\">DeepSeek highlights several advantages of MPFT, including its composition as a subset of Multi-Rail Fat-Tree (MRFT) allowing seamless integration of existing NVIDIA and NCCL optimizations for MRFT networks, cost-effectiveness, traffic isolation, reduced latency, and robustness. Performance analysis comparing MPFT and MRFT (Figures 5 and 6, Table 4) revealed that the all-to-all performance of multi-plane networks is very similar to single-plane multi-rail networks, and the performance of MPFT and MRFT was nearly identical when training the V3 model on 2048 GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AO6-6IW1BxXA9snkO.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2Ahwaa9vPQoLilXeQR.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AxEMD_5lpKKze1_O_.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c430\">Low-Latency Networking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bd68\">In DeepSeek’s model inference, large-scale EP heavily relies on all-to-all communication, which is sensitive to both bandwidth and latency. Even microsecond-level inherent network latency can significantly impact system performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ec4\">DeepSeek analyzes the latency characteristics of IB and RoCE (Table 5), noting IB’s consistently lower latency, making it preferable for latency-sensitive workloads like distributed training and inference. While RoCE offers a potentially cost-effective alternative, its current latency and scalability limitations prevent it from fully meeting the demands of large-scale AI systems. DeepSeek proposes specific improvements for RoCE, including dedicated low-latency RoCE switches, optimized routing policies, and enhanced traffic isolation or congestion control mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2ATEhtKdIlZaDVR_qf.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"78b7\">To further reduce network communication latency, DeepSeek utilizes InfiniBand GPUDirect Async (IBGDA). Traditionally, network communication involves CPU proxy threads, introducing additional overhead. IBGDA allows GPUs to directly populate Work Request (WR) content and write to RDMA doorbell MMIO addresses, eliminating the significant latency associated with GPU-CPU communication. By managing the entire control plane within the GPU, IBGDA avoids CPU bottlenecks, especially when sending numerous small packets, as the GPU’s parallel threads can distribute the workload. DeepSeek’s DeepEP and other works have demonstrated significant performance gains using IBGDA, leading DeepSeek to advocate for broad support of such features across various accelerator devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"b8d1\">Discussion and Insights for Future Hardware Architecture Design</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d8e0\">Building upon the identified hardware limitations and proposed solutions in specific application contexts, the paper broadens the discussion to offer forward-looking directions for future hardware architecture design:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Robustness Challenges:</strong> Addressing hardware failures and silent data corruption through advanced error detection and correction mechanisms for building non-stop AI infrastructure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CPU Bottlenecks and Interconnect Limitations:</strong> Optimizing CPU-accelerator collaboration, particularly breaking the limitations of traditional interfaces like PCIe for high-speed, bottleneck-free intra-node communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Intelligent Networks for AI:</strong> Creating low-latency and intelligent networks with technologies like co-packaged optics, lossless mechanisms, and adaptive routing to handle complex communication demands.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Memory Semantic Communication and Ordering:</strong> Resolving data consistency and ordering challenges in current memory semantic communication, exploring hardware-level built-in guarantees for improved communication efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Computation and Compression in the Network:</strong> Offloading computation and compression capabilities into the network, especially for specific workloads like EP, to unlock network bandwidth potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Memory-Centric Architecture Innovations:</strong> Addressing the memory bandwidth crisis driven by exponential model scaling, exploring cutting-edge technologies like DRAM stacking and wafer-scale integration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c6e6\">The paper delves into each of these areas with specific insights and recommendations, highlighting the need for a holistic co-design approach between hardware and software to enable the continued advancement and accessibility of large-scale AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d076\">In conclusion, this technical report provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions encountered during the development and training of DeepSeek-V3.

This latest iteration builds upon previous work by introducing an innovative recursive theorem-proving pipeline, leveraging the power of DeepSeek-V3 to generate its own high-quality initialization data. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving and is accompanied by the introduction of ProverBench, a new benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"09ca\">Pioneering Cold-Start Reasoning Data Generation</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"acb3\">A key innovation of DeepSeek-Prover-V2 lies in its unique cold-start training procedure. This process begins by prompting the powerful DeepSeek-V3 model to decompose complex mathematical theorems into a series of more manageable subgoals. Simultaneously, DeepSeek-V3 formalizes these high-level proof steps in Lean 4, effectively creating a structured sequence of sub-problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"aaf8\">To handle the computationally intensive proof search for each subgoal, the researchers employed a smaller 7B parameter model. Once all the decomposed steps of a challenging problem are successfully proven, the complete step-by-step formal proof is paired with DeepSeek-V3’s corresponding chain-of-thought reasoning. This ingenious approach allows the model to learn from a synthesized dataset that integrates both informal, high-level mathematical reasoning and rigorous formal proofs, providing a strong cold start for subsequent reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5fe8\">Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Reasoning</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7e36\">Building upon the synthetic cold-start data, the DeepSeek team curated a selection of challenging problems that the 7B prover model couldn’t solve end-to-end, but for which all subgoals had been successfully addressed. By combining the formal proofs of these subgoals, a complete proof for the original problem is constructed. This formal proof is then linked with DeepSeek-V3’s chain-of-thought outlining the lemma decomposition, creating a unified training example of informal reasoning followed by formalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"00ba\">The prover model is then fine-tuned on this synthetic data, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. This stage utilizes binary correct-or-incorrect feedback as the reward signal, further refining the model’s ability to bridge the gap between informal mathematical intuition and the precise construction of formal proofs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c968\">State-of-the-Art Performance</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f1d8\">The culmination of this innovative training process is DeepSeek-Prover-V2–671B, a model boasting 671 billion parameters. This model has achieved remarkable results, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving. It reached an impressive&nbsp;<strong>88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test</strong>&nbsp;and successfully solved&nbsp;<strong>49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench</strong>. The proofs generated by DeepSeek-Prover-V2 for the miniF2F dataset are publicly available for download, allowing for further scrutiny and analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A700/1%2AA4FJp063Twh0PPL5qxWlCQ.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d327\">Introducing ProverBench: A New Standard for Evaluation</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f746\">In addition to the model release, DeepSeek AI has introduced&nbsp;<strong>ProverBench</strong>, a new benchmark dataset comprising&nbsp;<strong>325 problems</strong>. This benchmark is designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities across different levels of difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7c01\">ProverBench includes&nbsp;<strong>15 problems formalized from recent AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) competitions (AIME 24 and 25)</strong>, providing authentic challenges at the high-school competition level. The remaining&nbsp;<strong>310 problems are drawn from curated textbook examples and educational tutorials</strong>, offering a diverse and pedagogically sound collection of formalized mathematical problems spanning various areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A220/1%2AtLIp5BCcMScgVl7jsZYusw.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"dfe3\">ProverBench aims to facilitate a more thorough assessment of neural theorem provers across both challenging competition problems and fundamental undergraduate-level mathematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"75e0\">Availability</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a6be\">DeepSeek AI is releasing DeepSeek-Prover-V2 in two model sizes to cater to different computational resources: a 7B parameter model and the larger 671B parameter model. DeepSeek-Prover-V2–671B is built upon the robust foundation of DeepSeek-V3-Base. The smaller DeepSeek-Prover-V2–7B is built upon DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base and features an extended context length of up to 32K tokens, allowing it to process longer and more complex reasoning sequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fe97\">The release of DeepSeek-Prover-V2 and the introduction of ProverBench mark a significant step forward in the field of neural theorem proving. By leveraging a recursive proof search pipeline and introducing a challenging new benchmark, DeepSeek AI is empowering the community to develop and evaluate more sophisticated and capable AI systems for formal mathematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ada\">Link：<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B</a></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/30/deepseek-unveils-deepseek-prover-v2-advancing-neural-theorem-proving-with-recursive-proof-search-and-a-new-benchmark/\">DeepSeek Unveils DeepSeek-Prover-V2: Advancing Neural Theorem Proving with Recursive Proof Search and a New Benchmark</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/30/deepseek-unveils-deepseek-prover-v2-advancing-neural-theorem-proving-with-recursive-proof-search-and-a-new-benchmark/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>21</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47162</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Can GRPO be 10x Efficient?

Recent community efforts have predominantly focused on mathematical reasoning, leaving the challenge of cross-domain generalization largely unexplored. Furthermore, standard Reinforcement Learning from Preference Optimization (GRPO) training is plagued by common issues such as performance bottlenecks, inefficient sample utilization, and difficulties in cultivating specialized reasoning skills when dealing with mixed-domain datasets. These challenges complicate the effective scaling of RL methods for LLMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing these limitations, researchers from the Kwaipilot team at Kuaishou have introduced a novel reinforcement learning framework: <strong>Two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO)</strong>. This innovative approach is designed to systematically tackle the aforementioned training challenges across multiple dimensions. The team has publicly released a technical report detailing the intricacies of their training method and has also open-sourced the <strong>SRPO-Qwen-32B</strong> model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, this work marks the <strong>first instance of achieving DeepSeek-R1-Zero-level performance concurrently in both mathematical and code domains</strong>. By leveraging the same base model as DeepSeek (Qwen2.5-32B) and employing a purely reinforcement learning training approach, SRPO has achieved impressive results on the AIME24 (50) and LiveCodeBench (41.6) benchmarks, surpassing the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more remarkably, SRPO achieves this level of performance with only <strong>one-tenth of the training steps</strong> required by R1-Zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZmEzMDA4M2RhYzZhNTc3YmU2N2NhMzMzNjI0YzYxMDlfYWFqQ3N3ZGN1MWF3UW5oYlE5SlVaNENhclF3WEtIZU5fVG9rZW46TFhJMGJXbEIzb0d4RU54VXBiS2MybHE3bnBmXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges with Vanilla GRPO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In their initial explorations, the Kwaipilot team experimented with the standard GRPO algorithm. However, they quickly encountered bottlenecks that prevented the model from reaching the desired R1-Zero performance levels. These issues included:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cross-Domain Optimization Conflicts (Math vs. Code):</strong> Mathematical problems tend to elicit longer and more detailed reasoning trajectories (Long CoT), while code data exhibits a weaker inclination towards this. Directly mixing these two data types led to conflicts, resulting in suboptimal performance in both domains.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced Training Efficiency due to Similar Group Rewards:</strong> The GRPO algorithm relies on the variance of non-zero rewards within a sampled group to calculate the advantage. When rollouts within a group yield nearly identical reward values, the calculated advantage approaches zero. If a significant portion of the training batch exhibits this phenomenon, effective gradient contributions become minimal, drastically reducing training efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Premature Performance Saturation:</strong> GRPO training encountered early performance plateaus and reward saturation on benchmark evaluations. This issue was partly attributed to insufficient data quality. When the training data lacks sufficient complexity or diversity, particularly with an abundance of simpler problems, the model tends to conservatively maintain its performance on easier tasks, hindering its ability to develop the complex and in-depth reasoning required for challenging problems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two-Staged Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the inherent response length conflicts between mathematical and code domains, the Kwaipilot team implemented a two-stage training paradigm:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stage 1: Eliciting Reasoning Abilities:</strong> This initial training phase focuses exclusively on challenging mathematical data. The primary goal is to fully incentivize the model&#8217;s test-time scaling, fostering capabilities such as reflective pausing, backtracking, and step-by-step decomposition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stage 2: Skill Integration:</strong> In this stage, code data is introduced into the training process. Building upon the reasoning foundation established in Stage 1, this phase aims to further enhance coding abilities while progressively strengthening procedural thinking, recursion, and tool-calling capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comparative Analysis of Training Strategies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of different training data strategies on response length was analyzed, revealing the following insights:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=YjAyZjA1MzIzY2ZmNjdiNjIzMTlkYjlkY2Q4OTQ5ZjZfUVR3R0FVNVByNEFTTElFN3JHeGxYMTZDRXRmY2x6NWVfVG9rZW46UGRURmJTcXdJb1R0emh4Q29XTmN6dFV1blZiXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mixed Training:</strong> Models trained on a mixture of math and code data showed limited growth in response length and poor benchmark performance. While math problems elicited some reasoning patterns, code problems often resulted in short, direct responses focused on immediate code output with minimal preliminary analysis or planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Math-Only Training:</strong> Training solely on mathematical data led to a stable increase in response length and excellent performance on math benchmarks. Crucially, it fostered strong and generalizable reasoning abilities; when faced with programming tasks, the model attempted detailed, step-by-step reasoning, including meticulous checking and revisiting steps in mathematical problem-solving.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Code-Only Training:</strong> While showing improved performance on code benchmarks, the development of explicit reasoning behavior was minimal, and achieving significant increases in response length proved difficult. Responses to both code and math problems were noticeably shorter compared to math-only training, with code solutions often being directly generated without substantial step-by-step reasoning or initial analysis.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staged Training:</strong> The two-stage training approach proposed by the Kwaipilot team yielded superior results in both mathematical and programming domains. The model consistently generated detailed step-by-step reasoning for math problems and structured reasoning patterns for programming tasks. Notably, complex behaviors emerged, such as the model spontaneously utilizing code to assist in mathematical reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History Resampling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team observed that during the mid-to-late stages of training, nearly 50% of the sampled groups within a batch produced identical rewards. This often occurred when the model consistently succeeded on easier problems, leading to minimal reward variance and ineffective gradient updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZWJjZjQ1ODExYzQzMjBjM2FlNWYwZThmYWQ3MTQ0MTRfcEpqYTlyMUZwTmhObG9PWHhQZmxVcVRnNnpwVzFNREpfVG9rZW46S0NLRmJ6dzdMb3NoakF4c3FFUmNZTFk1bkpoXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this inefficiency and improve the quality of the gradient signal, they introduced <strong>History Resampling</strong>. During training, they recorded the reward outcomes of all rollouts within each epoch. At the end of an epoch, they reconstructed the dataset for the next epoch based on the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Filtering Overly Simple Samples:</strong> Samples where all rollouts resulted in correct answers were excluded, as they provided no informative signal for policy improvement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retaining Informative Samples:</strong> Samples with diverse outcomes (both correct and incorrect) or all incorrect outcomes were retained. These samples generated positive reward variance, ensuring non-zero advantages and effective gradient signals. Furthermore, difficult samples where all rollouts were incorrect in the current epoch were also kept. The rationale is that these initially challenging problems might become relatively easier for the updated policy, thus generating effective gradients in subsequent training. This strategy aligns with the principle of curriculum learning, gradually exposing the model to increasingly challenging samples on average to enhance training efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Dynamic Sampling method proposed in DAPO, History Resampling significantly improved computational efficiency and resulted in more stable response length growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team performed meticulous data cleaning and filtering on publicly available Code&amp;Math datasets. They applied heuristic rules to filter out irrelevant URLs, formatting noise, and ensured the completeness of core fields (question and answer ground truth) in the original data. Following the data cleaning approach of PRIME for mathematical data, they removed multi-part questions, pure proof-based problems, and those requiring image or table understanding. For code data, they excluded problems dependent on specific environments, file I/O, or network interactions, focusing on algorithmic logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before data ingestion, they conducted correctness verification for both math and code problems to ensure the accuracy and solvability of the answers, discarding those with incorrect or ambiguous solutions. Subsequently, they assessed the difficulty of each problem, categorizing them into easy, medium, and hard levels based on their pass rate (Pass@k).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section details the experimental results obtained using the SRPO method. The Kwaipilot team focused on observing the changes in reward and metrics such as response length during training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training Process</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=Y2JhZWNhNTc4YzkxYTFkOWU3NTE4ZDE4YjM5Zjk5ODZfVHpQdjJKcFdEdVltOG1taExMblRHaERzWUhPV0U2a3lfVG9rZW46U3FCU2JrSFBob2ZyeDJ4UXVCYWNhZE9sbjVlXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The figure above illustrates the complete reward curve and response length curve during SRPO training. After the initial reward growth began to plateau, the training transitioned into the second stage. At the beginning of the second stage, the overall reward decreased due to the model&#8217;s prior lack of training on code, followed by a steady increase in reward during subsequent training. Integrating code data did not significantly increase the response length, which aligned with their expectations. <strong>Simultaneously, benchmark results indicated a continuous and stable improvement in both the mathematical and coding abilities of the model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new method.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, History Resampling ensured that gradient updates remained effective at each training step, directly increasing the proportion of informative gradients. This enhanced sampling efficiency led to stable reward growth, clearly showcasing the improved training efficiency achieved by the resampling strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reasoning Behaviors</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team identified three representative reflective patterns: recheck, hesitation, and exploration. They statistically analyzed responses containing these patterns and recorded the average response length for each. During RL training, they observed a gradual increase in the frequency of the model&#8217;s self-reflection, correction, and backtracking, indicating the emergence of a &#8220;self-verification&#8221; ability. They posit that the emergence of &#8220;reflection,&#8221; akin to human cognitive processes, in the model during RL is an adaptive behavior resulting from the policy optimization process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MjI3NzQ1ZmQxNzk3OTU2NDNjYjFiNWFhMzBkMGY2MzhfVHhrNVV5TG1ERkxoSjFFVzJBOWMwazU4STRHZXlVNk5fVG9rZW46UXN1emJ6UnVSbzRCYjV4cjBJZmNxYTI2bmhlXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As shown in the figure above, the model exhibited almost no proactive checking and reflection of previous reasoning steps in the early stages of training. However, as training progressed, the model displayed significant reflective and backtracking behaviors, forming response patterns such as step-by-step reasoning, numerical substitution, step-by-step verification, and self-optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZDk1MjJmNmVjOTJhNWY0NGJjOGQ2NTUyZTZlNTdmNzFfWWc1V2RudHdXTUZIUWJVVUsxRmNMaDBxS25sY2hTY3lfVG9rZW46RmJxMWJFcndYb2V1Zk54dU5iTGNVWUJFblFmXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, they also discovered that the model learned to spontaneously use program code for verification when solving mathematical problems. It would first provide a solution process through mathematical reasoning and then proactively write program code to verify the correctness of the solution. These instances demonstrated the model&#8217;s ability to leverage procedural thinking for self-correction and multiple attempts, further indicating that in the later stages of training, the model had mastered broad thinking and the integrated application of various code-based reasoning approaches for problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Paper SRPO: A Cross-Domain Implementation of Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on LLM is on </strong><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14286\">arXiv</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try with the SRPO-Qwen-32B</strong> <strong>Model on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14286\">HuggingFace</a></strong></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/23/can-grpo-be-10x-efficient-kwai-ais-srpo-suggests-yes-with-srpo/\">Can GRPO be 10x Efficient?

Simultaneously, the company has hinted at the imminent arrival of its next-generation model, R2, building anticipation within the AI community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper, titled &#8220;<em>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</em>&#8221; introduces a novel method that allows GRMs to optimize reward generation by dynamically producing principles and critiques. This is achieved through rejection fine-tuning and rule-based online reinforcement learning [1-1].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development comes at a time when the paradigm for scaling LLMs is shifting from the pre-training stage to post-training, particularly the inference phase, following the emergence of models like OpenAI&#8217;s o1. This approach leverages increased reinforcement learning (computational effort during training) and more extensive &#8220;thinking time&#8221; (computational effort during testing) to continually improve model performance. Notably, o1 generates a lengthy internal chain of thought before responding to users, refining its reasoning process, exploring different strategies, and identifying its own errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek&#8217;s own R1 series of models has further validated the potential of pure reinforcement learning training (without relying on supervised fine-tuning) to achieve significant leaps in LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental &#8220;next token prediction&#8221; mechanism of LLMs, while providing vast knowledge, often lacks deep planning and the ability to predict long-term outcomes, making them susceptible to short-sighted decisions. Reinforcement learning serves as a crucial complement, providing LLMs with an &#8220;Internal World Model.&#8221; This enables them to simulate the potential outcomes of different reasoning paths, evaluate the quality of these paths, and select superior solutions, ultimately leading to more systematic long-term planning. The synergy between LLMs and RL is increasingly recognized as key to enhancing the ability to solve complex problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wu Yi, an assistant professor at Tsinghua&#8217;s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), likened the relationship between LLMs and reinforcement learning to a &#8220;multiplicative relationship&#8221; in a recent podcast. While reinforcement learning excels in decision-making, it inherently lacks understanding. The construction of understanding relies on pre-trained models, upon which reinforcement learning can then further optimize decision-making capabilities. This &#8220;multiplicative relationship&#8221; suggests that only when a strong foundation of understanding, memory, and logical reasoning is built during pre-training can reinforcement learning fully unlock its potential to create a complete intelligent agent [1-2].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive survey paper titled &#8220;Reinforcement Learning Enhanced LLMs: A Survey&#8221; outlines the typical three-step process of using RL to train LLMs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reward Model Training:</strong> Before fine-tuning, a reward model (or reward function) is trained to approximate human preferences and evaluate different LLM outputs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Preference-Based Fine-Tuning:</strong> In each fine-tuning iteration, the large language model generates multiple responses to a given instruction, and each response is scored using the trained reward model.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Policy </strong><strong>Optimization</strong><strong>:</strong> Reinforcement learning optimization techniques are used to update the model&#8217;s weights based on the preference scores, aiming to improve response generation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating reinforcement learning allows large language models to dynamically adjust based on varying preference scores, moving beyond the limitations of a single, pre-determined answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DeepSeek&#8217;s SPCT: Addressing the Scaling Challenges of </strong><strong>RL</strong><strong> for </strong><strong>LLMs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning in post-training as a breakthrough for enhancing LLM performance, reinforcement learning algorithms themselves still have significant room for improvement, and the &#8220;Scaling Laws&#8221; of reinforcement learning are still in their nascent stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional scaling laws that focus on increasing data and compute to improve model performance, the scaling laws for reinforcement learning are influenced by more complex factors, including sample throughput, model parameter size, and the complexity of the training environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major hurdle in the scaling of reinforcement learning is reward sparsity. The reward model is a critical component, and generating accurate reward signals is paramount. Achieving both generalization and continuity in reward models is a key focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek and Tsinghua researchers addressed this challenge in their recent work by exploring the scalability and generalization of reward models at inference time. Their proposed Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) method aims to improve the scalability of general reward modeling during inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPCT approach involves two key stages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Rejection Fine-Tuning:</strong> This serves as a cold start, enabling the GRM to adapt to generating principles and critiques in the correct format and type.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rule-Based Online RL:</strong> This stage further optimizes the generation of principles and critiques.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve effective inference-time scaling, the researchers employed parallel sampling to maximize computational utilization. By sampling multiple times, the DeepSeek-GRM can generate different sets of principles and critiques and select the final reward through voting. Furthermore, a meta-reward model (Meta RM) is trained to guide the voting process, further enhancing scaling performance. The Meta RM is a point-to-point scalar reward model designed to identify the correctness of the principles and critiques generated by the DeepSeek-GRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experimental results demonstrated that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models on multiple comprehensive RM benchmarks without significant domain bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead: DeepSeek R2 on the Horizon</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the research paper focuses on advancements in reward modeling and inference-time scaling, the mention of DeepSeek&#8217;s R1 series and the implicit progression suggests that the company is actively developing its next-generation model, R2. Given DeepSeek&#8217;s emphasis on pure reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning, it is highly anticipated that R2 will incorporate and build upon the insights gained from this latest research on scalable reward models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI community will be keenly watching for further announcements regarding DeepSeek R2, eager to see how the company leverages its innovative approaches to reinforcement learning and inference optimization to push the boundaries of large language model capabilities. The focus on scalable reward models hints at a potential emphasis on even more sophisticated self-evaluation and improvement mechanisms within their next flagship model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper <em>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</em> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495\" title=\"\">arXiv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/11/deepseek-signals-next-gen-r2-model-unveils-novel-approach-to-scaling-inference-with-spct/\">DeepSeek Signals Next-Gen R2 Model, Unveils Novel Approach to Scaling Inference with SPCT</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/11/deepseek-signals-next-gen-r2-model-unveils-novel-approach-to-scaling-inference-with-spct/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>12</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47130</post-id>\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>"

Whether you’re writing Shakespearean sonnets, debugging code, or need an answer to an obscure trivia question, artificial intelligence systems seem to have you covered. The source of this versatility? Billions, or even trillions, of textual data points across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Those data aren’t enough to teach a robot to be a helpful household or factory assistant, though. To understand how to handle, stack, and place various arrangements of objects across diverse environments, robots need demonstrations. You can think of robot training data as a collection of how-to videos that walk the systems through each motion of a task. Collecting these demonstrations on real robots is time-consuming and not perfectly repeatable, so engineers have created training data by generating simulations with AI (which don’t often reflect real-world physics), or tediously handcrafting each digital environment from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Toyota Research Institute may have found a way to create the diverse, realistic training grounds robots need. Their “&lt;a href=\"https://steerable-scene-generation.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;steerable scene generation&lt;/a&gt;” approach creates digital scenes of things like kitchens, living rooms, and restaurants that engineers can use to simulate lots of real-world interactions and scenarios. Trained on over 44 million 3D rooms filled with models of objects such as tables and plates, the tool places existing assets in new scenes, then refines each one into a physically accurate, lifelike environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Steerable scene generation creates these 3D worlds by “steering” a diffusion model — an AI system that generates a visual from random noise — toward a scene you’d find in everyday life. The researchers used this generative system to “in-paint” an environment, filling in particular elements throughout the scene. You can imagine a blank canvas suddenly turning into a kitchen scattered with 3D objects, which are gradually rearranged into a scene that imitates real-world physics. For example, the system ensures that a fork doesn’t pass through a bowl on a table — a common glitch in 3D graphics known as “clipping,” where models overlap or intersect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How exactly steerable scene generation guides its creation toward realism, however, depends on the strategy you choose. Its main strategy is “Monte Carlo tree search” (MCTS), where the model creates a series of alternative scenes, filling them out in different ways toward a particular objective (like making a scene more physically realistic, or including as many edible items as possible). It’s used by the AI program AlphaGo to beat human opponents in Go (a game similar to chess), as the system considers potential sequences of moves before choosing the most advantageous one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are the first to apply MCTS to scene generation by framing the scene generation task as a sequential decision-making process,” says MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) PhD student Nicholas Pfaff, who is a CSAIL researcher and a lead author on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://steerable-scene-generation.github.io/\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; presenting the work. “We keep building on top of partial scenes to produce better or more desired scenes over time. As a result, MCTS creates scenes that are more complex than what the diffusion model was trained on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In one particularly telling experiment, MCTS added the maximum number of objects to a simple restaurant scene. It featured as many as 34 items on a table, including massive stacks of dim sum dishes, after training on scenes with only 17 objects on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Steerable scene generation also allows you to generate diverse training scenarios via reinforcement learning — essentially, teaching a diffusion model to fulfill an objective by trial-and-error. After you train on the initial data, your system undergoes a second training stage, where you outline a reward (basically, a desired outcome with a score indicating how close you are to that goal). The model automatically learns to create scenes with higher scores, often producing scenarios that are quite different from those it was trained on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users can also prompt the system directly by typing in specific visual descriptions (like “a kitchen with four apples and a bowl on the table”). Then, steerable scene generation can bring your requests to life with precision. For example, the tool accurately followed users’ prompts at rates of 98 percent when building scenes of pantry shelves, and 86 percent for messy breakfast tables. Both marks are at least a 10 percent improvement over comparable methods like&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21066\"&gt;MiDiffusion&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14207\"&gt;DiffuScene&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system can also complete specific scenes via prompting or light directions (like “come up with a different scene arrangement using the same objects”). You could ask it to place apples on several plates on a kitchen table, for instance, or put board games and books on a shelf. It’s essentially “filling in the blank” by slotting items in empty spaces, but preserving the rest of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;According to the researchers, the strength of their project lies in its ability to create many scenes that roboticists can actually use. “A key insight from our findings is that it’s OK for the scenes we pre-trained on to not exactly resemble the scenes that we actually want,” says Pfaff. “Using our steering methods, we can move beyond that broad distribution and sample from a ‘better’ one. In other words, generating the diverse, realistic, and task-aligned scenes that we actually want to train our robots in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Such vast scenes became the testing grounds where they could record a virtual robot interacting with different items. The machine carefully placed forks and knives into a cutlery holder, for instance, and rearranged bread onto plates in various 3D settings. Each simulation appeared fluid and realistic, resembling the real-world, adaptable robots steerable scene generation could help train, one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;While the system could be an encouraging path forward in generating lots of diverse training data for robots, the researchers say their work is more of a proof of concept. In the future, they’d like to use generative AI to create entirely new objects and scenes, instead of using a fixed library of assets. They also plan to incorporate articulated objects that the robot could open or twist (like cabinets or jars filled with food) to make the scenes even more interactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To make their virtual environments even more realistic, Pfaff and his colleagues may incorporate real-world objects by using a library of objects and scenes pulled from images on the internet and using their previous work on “&lt;a href=\"https://scalable-real2sim.github.io/\"&gt;Scalable Real2Sim&lt;/a&gt;.” By expanding how diverse and lifelike AI-constructed robot testing grounds can be, the team hopes to build a community of users that’ll create lots of data, which could then be used as a massive dataset to teach dexterous robots different skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today, creating realistic scenes for simulation can be quite a challenging endeavor; procedural generation can readily produce a large number of scenes, but they likely won’t be representative of the environments the robot would encounter in the real world. Manually creating bespoke scenes is both time-consuming and expensive,” says Jeremy Binagia, an applied scientist at Amazon Robotics who wasn’t involved in the paper. “Steerable scene generation offers a better approach: train a generative model on a large collection of pre-existing scenes and adapt it (using a strategy such as reinforcement learning) to specific downstream applications. Compared to previous works that leverage an off-the-shelf vision-language model or focus just on arranging objects in a 2D grid, this approach guarantees physical feasibility and considers full 3D translation and rotation, enabling the generation of much more interesting scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Steerable scene generation with post training and inference-time search provides a novel and efficient framework for automating scene generation at scale,” says Toyota Research Institute roboticist Rick Cory SM ’08, PhD ’10, who also wasn’t involved in the paper. “Moreover, it can generate ‘never-before-seen’ scenes that are deemed important for downstream tasks. In the future, combining this framework with vast internet data could unlock an important milestone towards efficient training of robots for deployment in the real world.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfaff wrote the paper with senior author Russ Tedrake, the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT; a senior vice president of large behavior models at the Toyota Research Institute; and CSAIL principal investigator.

The biennial journeys activated in her a motivation that continues to shape her research and her teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting her family home in Massachusetts, Donti — now the Silverman Family Career Development Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems — was struck by the disparities in how people live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very clear to me the extent to which inequity is a rampant issue around the world,” Donti says. “From a young age, I knew that I definitely wanted to address that issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That motivation was further stoked by a high school biology teacher, who focused his class on climate and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned that climate change, this huge, important issue, would exacerbate inequity,” Donti says. “That really stuck with me and put a fire in my belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when Donti enrolled at Harvey Mudd College, she thought she would direct her energy toward the study of chemistry or materials science to create next-generation solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those plans, however, were jilted. Donti “fell in love” with computer science, and then discovered work by researchers in the United Kingdom who were arguing that artificial intelligence and machine learning would be essential to help integrate renewables into power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the first time I’d seen those two interests brought together,” she says. “I got hooked and have been working on that topic ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pursuing a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, Donti was able to design her degree to include computer science and public policy. In her research, she explored the need for fundamental algorithms and tools that could manage, at scale, power grids relying heavily on renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to have a hand in developing those algorithms and tool kits by creating new machine learning techniques grounded in computer science,” she says. “But I wanted to make sure that the way I was doing the work was grounded both in the actual energy systems domain and working with people in that domain” to provide what was actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donti was working on her PhD, she co-founded a nonprofit called Climate Change AI. Her objective, she says, was to help the community of people involved in climate and sustainability — “be they computer scientists, academics, practitioners, or policymakers” — to come together and access resources, connection, and education “to help them along that journey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the climate space,” she says, “you need experts in particular climate change-related sectors, experts in different technical and social science tool kits, problem owners, affected users, policymakers who know the regulations — all of those — to have on-the-ground scalable impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Donti came to MIT in September 2023, it was not surprising that she was drawn by its initiatives directing the application of computer science toward society’s biggest problems, especially the current threat to the health of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really thinking about where technology has a much longer-horizon impact and how technology, society, and policy all have to work together,” Donti says. “Technology is not just one-and-done and monetizable in the context of a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work uses deep learning models to incorporate the physics and hard constraints of electric power systems that employ renewables for better forecasting, optimization, and control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is already really widely used for things like solar power forecasting, which is a prerequisite to managing and balancing power grids,” she says. “My focus is, how do you improve the algorithms for actually balancing power grids in the face of a range of time-varying renewables?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Donti’s breakthroughs is a promising solution for power grid operators to be able to optimize for cost, taking into account the actual physical realities&amp;nbsp;of the grid, rather than relying on approximations. While the solution is not yet deployed, it appears to work 10 times faster, and far more cheaply, than previous technologies, and has attracted the attention of grid operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another technology she is developing works to provide data that can be used in training machine learning systems for power system optimization. In general, much data related to the systems is private, either because it is proprietary or because of security concerns. Donti and her research group are working to create synthetic data and benchmarks that, Donti says, “can help to expose some of the underlying problems” in making power systems more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is,” Donti says, “can we bring our datasets to a point such that they are just hard enough to drive progress?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her efforts, Donti has been awarded the U.S. Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. She was recognized as part of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 2021 list of “35 Innovators Under 35” and Vox’s 2023 “Future Perfect 50.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next spring, Donti will co-teach a class called AI for Climate Action with Sara Beery, EECS assistant professor, whose focus is AI for biodiversity and ecosystems, and Abigail Bodner, assistant professor in the departments of EECS and Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, whose focus is AI for climate and Earth science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re all super-excited about it,” Donti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to MIT, Donti says, “I knew that there would be an ecosystem of people who really cared, not just about success metrics like publications and citation counts, but about the impact of our work on society.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-LIDS-Priya-Donti.jpg?itok=sHTN9uLy\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“Machine learning is already really widely used for things like solar power forecasting, which is a prerequisite to managing and balancing power grids,” says EECS assistant professor and LIDS PI Priya Donti. “My focus is: How do you improve the algorithms for actually balancing power grids in the face of a range of time-varying renewables?”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Adam Glanzman</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/profile\">Profile</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/renewable-energy\">Renewable energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electric-grid\">Electric grid</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-and-policy\">Technology and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New prediction model could improve the reliability of fusion power plants</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-prediction-model-could-improve-reliability-fusion-power-plants-1007</link>\n  <description>The approach combines physics and machine learning to avoid damaging disruptions when powering down tokamak fusion machines.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-prediction-model-could-improve-reliability-fusion-power-plants-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are machines that are meant to hold and harness the power of the sun. These fusion machines use powerful magnets to contain a plasma hotter than the sun’s core and push the plasma’s atoms to fuse and release energy. If tokamaks can operate safely and efficiently, the machines could one day provide clean and limitless fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are a number of experimental tokamaks in operation around the world, with more underway. Most are small-scale research machines built to investigate how the devices can spin up plasma and harness its energy. One of the challenges that tokamaks face is how to safely and reliably turn off a plasma current that is circulating at speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second, at temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such “rampdowns” are necessary when a plasma becomes unstable. To prevent the plasma from further disrupting and potentially damaging the device’s interior, operators ramp down the plasma current. But occasionally the rampdown itself can destabilize the plasma. In some machines, rampdowns have caused scrapes and scarring to the tokamak’s interior — minor damage that still requires considerable time and resources to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at MIT have developed a method to predict how plasma in a tokamak will behave during a rampdown. The team combined machine-learning tools with a physics-based model of plasma dynamics to simulate a plasma’s behavior and any instabilities that may arise as the plasma is ramped down and turned off. The researchers trained and tested the new model on plasma data from an experimental tokamak in Switzerland. They found the method quickly learned how plasma would evolve as it was tuned down in different ways. What’s more, the method achieved a high level of accuracy using a relatively small amount of data. This training efficiency is promising, given that each experimental run of a tokamak is expensive and quality data is limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which the team highlights this week in an &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63917-x\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;open-access &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, could improve the safety and reliability of future fusion power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For fusion to be a useful energy source it’s going to have to be reliable,” says lead author Allen Wang, a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics and a member of the &lt;a href=\"https://disruptions.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Disruption Group&lt;/a&gt; at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). “To be reliable, we need to get good at managing our plasmas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include PSFC Principal Research Scientist and Disruptions Group leader Cristina Rea, and members of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) Oswin So, Charles Dawson, and Professor Chuchu Fan, along with Mark (Dan) Boyer of Commonwealth Fusion Systems and collaborators from the Swiss Plasma Center in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A delicate balance”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are experimental fusion devices that were first built in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The device gets its name from a Russian acronym that translates to a “toroidal chamber with magnetic coils.” Just as its name describes, a tokamak is toroidal, or donut-shaped, and uses powerful magnets to contain and spin up a gas to temperatures and energies high enough that atoms in the resulting plasma can fuse and release energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, tokamak experiments are relatively low-energy in scale, with few approaching the size and output needed to generate safe, reliable, usable energy. Disruptions in experimental, low-energy tokamaks are generally not an issue. But as fusion machines scale up to grid-scale dimensions, controlling much higher-energy plasmas at all phases will be paramount to maintaining a machine’s safe and efficient operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uncontrolled plasma terminations, even during rampdown, can generate intense heat fluxes damaging the internal walls,” Wang notes. “Quite often, especially with the high-performance plasmas, rampdowns actually can push the plasma closer to some instability limits. So, it’s a delicate balance. And there’s a lot of focus now on how to manage instabilities so that we can routinely and reliably take these plasmas and safely power them down. And there are relatively few studies done on how to do that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing down the pulse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang and his colleagues developed a model to predict how a plasma will behave during tokamak rampdown. While they could have simply applied machine-learning tools such as a neural network to learn signs of instabilities in plasma data, “you would need an ungodly amount of data” for such tools to discern the very subtle and ephemeral changes in extremely high-temperature, high-energy plasmas, Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers paired a neural network with an existing model that simulates plasma dynamics according to the fundamental rules of physics. With this combination of machine learning and a physics-based plasma simulation, the team found that only a couple hundred pulses at low performance, and a small handful of pulses at high performance, were sufficient to train and validate the new model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data they used for the new study came from the TCV, the Swiss “variable configuration tokamak” operated by the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). The TCV is a small experimental fusion experimental device that is used for research purposes, often as test bed for next-generation device solutions. Wang used the data from several hundred TCV plasma pulses that included properties of the plasma such as its temperature and energies during each pulse’s ramp-up, run, and ramp-down. He trained the new model on this data, then tested it and found it was able to accurately predict the plasma’s evolution given the initial conditions of a particular tokamak run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed an algorithm to translate the model’s predictions into practical “trajectories,” or plasma-managing instructions that a tokamak controller can automatically carry out to for instance adjust the magnets or temperature maintain the plasma’s stability. They implemented the algorithm on several TCV runs and found that it produced trajectories that safely ramped down a plasma pulse, in some cases faster and without disruptions compared to runs without the new method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point the plasma will always go away, but we call it a disruption when the plasma goes away at high energy. Here, we ramped the energy down to nothing,” Wang notes. “We did it a number of times. And we did things much better across the board. So,&amp;nbsp;we had statistical confidence that we made things better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinout that intends to build the world’s first compact, grid-scale fusion power plant. The company is developing a demo tokamak, SPARC, designed to produce net-energy plasma, meaning that it should generate more energy than it takes to heat up the plasma. Wang and his colleagues are working with CFS on ways that the new prediction model and tools like it can better predict plasma behavior and prevent costly disruptions to enable safe and reliable fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to tackle the science questions to make fusion routinely useful,” Wang says. “What we’ve done here is the start of what is still a long journey. But I think we’ve made some nice progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional support for the research came from the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, via the Euratom Research and Training Program and funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Tokamak-Tuning-01.jpg?itok=9QY6-LY8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT researchers have developed a prediction model that could improve the safety and reliability of tokamak fusion reactors.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/fusion\">Fusion</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/fluid-dynamics\">Fluid dynamics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/plasma-science-and-fusion-center\">Plasma Science and Fusion Center</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/renewable-energy\">Renewable energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-power-and-reactors\">Nuclear power and reactors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Printable aluminum alloy sets strength records, may enable lighter aircraft parts</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/printable-aluminum-alloy-sets-strength-records-may-enable-lighter-aircraft-parts-1007</link>\n  <description>Incorporating machine learning, MIT engineers developed a way to 3D print alloys that are much stronger than conventionally manufactured versions.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/printable-aluminum-alloy-sets-strength-records-may-enable-lighter-aircraft-parts-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a printable aluminum alloy that can withstand high temperatures and is five times stronger than traditionally manufactured aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new printable metal is made from a mix of aluminum and other elements that the team identified using a combination of simulations and machine learning, which significantly pruned the number of possible combinations of materials to search through. While traditional methods would require simulating over 1 million possible combinations of materials, the team’s new machine learning-based approach needed only to evaluate 40 possible compositions before identifying an ideal mix for a high-strength, printable aluminum alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they printed the alloy and tested the resulting material, the team confirmed that, as predicted, the aluminum alloy was as strong as the strongest aluminum alloys that are manufactured today using traditional casting methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;researchers envision that the new printable aluminum could be made into stronger, more lightweight and temperature-resistant products, such as fan blades in jet engines. Fan blades are traditionally&amp;nbsp;cast from titanium — a material that is more than 50 percent heavier and up to 10 times costlier than aluminum — or made from advanced composites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can use lighter, high-strength material, this would save a considerable amount of energy for the transportation industry,” says&amp;nbsp;Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi, who led the work as a postdoc at MIT and is now an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because 3D printing can produce complex geometries, save material, and enable unique designs, we see this printable alloy as something that could also be used in advanced vacuum pumps, high-end automobiles, and cooling devices for data centers,” adds John Hart, the Class of 1922 Professor and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart and Taheri-Mousavi provide details on the new printable aluminum design in a &lt;a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202509507\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s MIT co-authors include Michael Xu, Clay Houser, Shaolou Wei, James LeBeau, and Greg Olson, along with Florian Hengsbach and Mirko Schaper of Paderborn University in Germany, and Zhaoxuan Ge and Benjamin Glaser of Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro-sizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work grew out of an MIT class that Taheri-Mousavi took in 2020, which was taught by Greg Olson, professor of the practice in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. As part of the class, students learned to use computational simulations to design high-performance alloys. Alloys are materials that are made from a mix of different elements, the combination of which imparts exceptional strength and other unique properties to the material as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson challenged the class to design an aluminum alloy that would be stronger than the strongest printable aluminum alloy designed to date. As with most materials, the strength of aluminum depends in large part on its microstructure: The smaller and more densely packed its microscopic constituents, or “precipitates,” the stronger the alloy would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the class used computer simulations to methodically combine aluminum with various types and concentrations of elements, to simulate and predict the resulting alloy’s strength. However, the exercise failed to produce a stronger result. At the end of the class, Taheri-Mousavi wondered: Could machine learning do better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, there are a lot of things that contribute nonlinearly to a material’s properties, and you are lost,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “With machine-learning tools, they can point you to where you need to focus, and tell you for example, these two elements are controlling this feature. It lets you explore the design space more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer by layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Taheri-Mousavi continued where Olson’s class left off, this time looking to identify a stronger recipe for aluminum alloy. This time, she used machine-learning techniques designed to efficiently comb through data such as the properties of elements, to identify key connections and correlations that should lead to a more desirable outcome or product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She found that, using just 40 compositions mixing aluminum with different elements, their machine-learning approach quickly homed in on a recipe for an aluminum alloy with higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and therefore higher strength, than what the previous studies identified. The alloy’s strength was even higher than what they could identify after simulating over 1 million possibilities without using machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To physically produce this new strong, small-precipitate alloy, the team realized 3D printing would be the way to go instead of traditional metal casting, in which molten liquid aluminum is poured into a mold and is left to cool and harden. The longer this cooling time is, the more likely the individual precipitate is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that 3D printing, broadly also known as additive manufacturing, can be a faster way to cool and solidify the aluminum alloy. Specifically, they considered laser bed powder fusion (LBPF) — a technique by which a powder is deposited, layer by layer, on a surface in a desired pattern and then quickly melted by a laser that traces over the pattern. The melted pattern is thin enough that it solidfies quickly before another layer is deposited and similarly “printed.” The team found that LBPF’s inherently rapid cooling and solidification enabled the small-precipitate, high-strength aluminum alloy that their machine learning method predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes we have to think about how to get a material to be compatible with 3D printing,” says study co-author John Hart. “Here, 3D printing opens a new door because of the unique characteristics of the process — particularly, the fast cooling rate. Very rapid freezing of the alloy after it’s melted by the laser creates this special set of properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting their idea into practice, the researchers ordered a formulation of printable powder, based on their new aluminum alloy recipe. They sent the powder — a mix of aluminum and five other elements — to collaborators in Germany, who printed small samples of the alloy using their in-house LPBF system. The samples were then sent to MIT where the team ran multiple tests to measure the alloy’s strength and image the samples’ microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results confirmed the predictions made by their initial machine learning search: The printed alloy was five times stronger than a casted counterpart and 50 percent stronger than alloys designed using conventional simulations without machine learning. The new alloy’s microstructure also consisted of a higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and was stable at high temperatures of up to 400 degrees Celsius — a very high temperature for aluminum alloys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are applying similar machine-learning techniques to further optimize other properties of the alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our methodology opens new doors for anyone who wants to do 3D printing alloy design,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “My dream is that one day, passengers looking out their airplane window will see fan blades of engines made from our aluminum alloys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was carried out, in part, using MIT.nano’s characterization facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Printing-Aluminum-01-press.jpg?itok=WsN06Kug\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new 3-D-printed aluminum alloy is stronger than traditional aluminum, due to a key recipe that, when printed, produces aluminum (illustrated in brown) with nanometer scale precipitates (in light blue).

The broad-spectrum drugs often prescribed for gut flare-ups can kill helpful microbes alongside harmful ones, sometimes worsening symptoms over time. When fighting gut inflammation, you don’t always want to bring a sledgehammer to a knife fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and McMaster University have &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02142-0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;identified a new compound&lt;/a&gt; that takes a more targeted approach. The molecule, called enterololin, suppresses a group of bacteria linked to Crohn’s disease flare-ups while leaving the rest of the microbiome largely intact. Using a generative AI model, the team mapped how the compound works, a process that usually takes years but was accelerated here to just months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This discovery speaks to a central challenge in antibiotic development,” says Jon Stokes, senior author of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02142-0\"&gt;new paper on the work&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster, and research affiliate at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. “The problem isn’t finding molecules that kill bacteria in a dish — we’ve been able to do that for a long time. A major hurdle is figuring out what those molecules actually do inside bacteria. Without that detailed understanding, you can’t develop these early-stage antibiotics into safe and effective therapies for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enterololin is a stride toward precision antibiotics: treatments designed to knock out only the bacteria causing trouble. In mouse models of Crohn’s-like inflammation, the drug zeroed in on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, a gut-dwelling bacterium that can worsen flares, while leaving most other microbial residents untouched. Mice given enterololin recovered faster and maintained a healthier microbiome than those treated with vancomycin, a common antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Pinning down a drug’s mechanism of action, the molecular target it binds inside bacterial cells, normally requires years of painstaking experiments. Stokes’ lab discovered enterololin using a high-throughput screening approach, but determining its target would have been the bottleneck. Here, the team turned to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/speeding-drug-discovery-with-diffusion-generative-models-diffdock-0331\"&gt;DiffDock&lt;/a&gt;, a generative AI model developed at CSAIL by MIT PhD student Gabriele Corso and MIT Professor Regina Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;DiffDock was designed to predict how small molecules fit into the binding pockets of proteins, a notoriously difficult problem in structural biology. Traditional docking algorithms search through possible orientations using scoring rules, often producing noisy results. DiffDock instead frames docking as a probabilistic reasoning problem: a diffusion model iteratively refines guesses until it converges on the most likely binding mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“In just a couple of minutes, the model predicted that enterololin binds to a protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential for transporting lipoproteins in certain bacteria,” says Barzilay, who also co-leads the Jameel Clinic. “That was a very concrete lead — one that could guide experiments, rather than replace them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Stokes’ group then put that prediction to the test. Using DiffDock predictions as an experimental GPS, they first evolved enterololin-resistant mutants of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in the lab, which revealed that changes in the mutant’s DNA mapped to lolCDE, precisely where DiffDock had predicted enterololin to bind. They also performed RNA sequencing to see which bacterial genes switched on or off when exposed to the drug, as well as used CRISPR to selectively knock down expression of the expected target. These laboratory experiments all revealed disruptions in pathways tied to lipoprotein transport, exactly what DiffDock had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“When you see the computational model and the wet-lab data pointing to the same mechanism, that’s when you start to believe you’ve figured something out,” says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For Barzilay, the project highlights a shift in how AI is used in the life sciences. “A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active,” she says. “What we’re showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;That distinction matters because mechanism-of-action studies are often a major rate-limiting step in drug development. Traditional approaches can take 18 months to two years, or more, and cost millions of dollars. In this case, the MIT–McMaster team cut the timeline to about six months, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enterololin is still in the early stages of development, but translation is already underway. Stokes’ spinout company, Stoked Bio, has licensed the compound and is optimizing its properties for potential human use. Early work is also exploring derivatives of the molecule against other resistant pathogens, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. If all goes well, clinical trials could begin within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers also see broader implications. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have long been sought as a way to treat infections without collateral damage to the microbiome, but they have been difficult to discover and validate. AI tools like DiffDock could make that process more practical, rapidly enabling a new generation of targeted antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For patients with Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel conditions, the prospect of a drug that reduces symptoms without destabilizing the microbiome could mean a meaningful improvement in quality of life. And in the bigger picture, precision antibiotics may help tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“What excites me is not just this compound, but the idea that we can start thinking about the mechanism of action elucidation as something we can do more quickly, with the right combination of AI, human intuition, and laboratory experiments,” says Stokes. “That has the potential to change how we approach drug discovery for many diseases, not just Crohn’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“One of the greatest challenges to our health is the increase of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that evade even our best antibiotics,” adds Yves Brun, professor at the University of Montreal and distinguished professor emeritus at Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “AI is becoming an important tool in our fight against these bacteria. This study uses a powerful and elegant combination of AI methods to determine the mechanism of action of a new antibiotic candidate, an important step in its potential development as a therapeutic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corso, Barzilay, and Stokes wrote the paper with McMaster researchers Denise B.

It’s now the third leg of the school, alongside teaching and research,” says Mark Gorenberg ’76, chair of the MIT Corporation. “I’m excited to have such a transformative leader as Ana join the Trust Center team, and I look forward to the impact she will have on the students and the wider academic community at MIT as we enter an exciting new phase in company building, driven by the accelerated use of AI and emerging technologies.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a time where we are rethinking management education, entrepreneurship as an interdisciplinary field to create impact is even more important to our future. To have such an experienced and accomplished leader in academia and the startup world, especially in AI, reinforces our commitment to be a global leader in this field,” says Richard M. Locke, John C Head III Dean at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is a unique hub of research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and that special mix creates massive positive impact that ripples around the world,” says Frederic Kerrest, MIT Sloan MBA ’09, co-founder of Okta, and member of the MIT Corporation. “In a rapidly changing, AI-driven world, Ana has the skills and experience to further accelerate MIT’s global leadership in entrepreneurship education to ensure that our students launch and scale the next generation of groundbreaking, innovation-driven startups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to her time at Oxford and King’s College, Bakshi served as an elected councilor representing 6,000-plus constituents, held roles in international nongovernmental organizations, and led product execution strategy at MAHI, an award-winning family-led craft sauce startup, available in thousands of major retailers across the U.K.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi sits on the&amp;nbsp;advisory council for conservation charity&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://savetheelephants.org/\"&gt;Save the Elephants&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging AI-driven and scientific approaches to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect elephant populations.&amp;nbsp;Her work and impact have been featured across &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, BBC, &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;. Bakshi was twice honored as a Top 50 Woman in Tech (U.K.), most recently in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI changes how we learn, how we build, and how we scale, my focus will be on helping MIT expand its support for phenomenal talent — students and faculty — with the skills, ecosystem, and backing to turn knowledge into impact,” Bakshi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 years of impact to date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center was founded in 1990 by the late Professor Edward Roberts and serves all MIT students across all schools and all disciplines.&amp;nbsp;It supports 60-plus courses and extensive extracurricular programming, including the delta v academic accelerator. Much of the work of the center is generated through the Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology, which offers a proven approach to create new ventures. Over a thousand schools and other organizations across the world use Disciplined Entrepreneurship books and resources to teach entrepreneurship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with AI-powered tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/orbit/\"&gt;Orbit&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-ai-jetpack-accelerates-entrepreneurial-process-0919\"&gt;JetPack&lt;/a&gt;, the Trust Center is changing the way that entrepreneurship is taught and practiced. Its mission is to produce the next generation of innovation-driven entrepreneurs while advancing the field more broadly to make it both rigorous and practical. This approach of leveraging proven evidence-based methodology, emerging technology, the ingenuity of MIT students, and responding to industry shifts is similar to how MIT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cheme.mit.edu/about/history/\"&gt;established the field of chemical engineering in the 1890s&lt;/a&gt;. The desired result in both cases was to create a comprehensive, integrated, scalable, rigorous, and practical curriculum to create a new workforce to address the nation’s and world’s greatest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-martintrust-bakshi.jpg?itok=GiAfFGg-\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Ana Bakshi is the new executive director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Chris Burns</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/leadership\">Leadership</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/staff\">Staff</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/business\">Business and management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/martin-trust-center-mit-entrepreneurship\">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Lincoln Lab unveils the most powerful AI supercomputer at any US university</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/lincoln-lab-unveils-most-powerful-ai-supercomputer-at-any-us-university-1002</link>\n  <description>Optimized for generative AI, TX-GAIN is driving innovation in biodefense, materials discovery, cybersecurity, and other areas of research and development.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 15:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/lincoln-lab-unveils-most-powerful-ai-supercomputer-at-any-us-university-1002</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Kylie Foy | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The new TX-Generative AI Next (TX-GAIN) computing system at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center&lt;/a&gt;  (LLSC) is the most powerful AI supercomputer at any U.S. university. With its recent ranking from  &lt;a href=\"https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;TOP500&lt;/a&gt;, which biannually publishes a list of the top supercomputers in various categories, TX-GAIN joins the ranks of other powerful systems at the LLSC, all supporting research and development at Lincoln Laboratory and across the MIT campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"TX-GAIN will enable our researchers to achieve scientific and engineering breakthroughs. The system will play a large role in supporting generative AI, physical simulation, and data analysis across all research areas,\" says Lincoln Laboratory Fellow&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jeremy Kepner&lt;/a&gt;, who heads the LLSC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC is a key resource for accelerating innovation at Lincoln Laboratory. Thousands of researchers tap into the LLSC to analyze data, train models, and run simulations for federally funded research projects. The supercomputers have been used, for example,&amp;nbsp;to simulate billions of aircraft encounters to develop collision-avoidance systems for the Federal Aviation Administration, and to train models in the complex tasks of autonomous navigation for the Department of Defense. Over the years, LLSC capabilities have been essential to numerous&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/#AwardsEnabled\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;award-winning technologies&lt;/a&gt;, including those that have improved  airline safety,  prevented the spread of new diseases, and  aided in hurricane responses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, TX-GAIN is especially equipped for developing and applying generative AI. Whereas traditional AI focuses on categorization tasks, like identifying whether a photo depicts a dog or cat, generative AI produces entirely new outputs. Kepner describes it as a mathematical combination of interpolation (filling in the gaps between known data points) and extrapolation (extending data beyond known points). Today, generative AI is widely known for its use of large language models to create human-like responses to user prompts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lincoln Laboratory, teams are applying generative AI to various domains beyond large language models. They are using the technology, for instance, to evaluate radar signatures, supplement weather data where coverage is missing, root out anomalies in network traffic, and explore chemical interactions to design new medicines and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable such intense computations, TX-GAIN is powered by more than 600 NVIDIA graphics processing unit accelerators specially designed for AI operations, in addition to traditional high-performance computing hardware. With a peak performance of two AI exaflops (two quintillion floating-point operations per second), TX-GAIN is the top AI system at a university, and in the Northeast.&amp;nbsp;Since TX-GAIN came online this summer, researchers have taken notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"TX-GAIN is allowing us to model not only significantly more protein interactions than ever before, but also much larger proteins with more atoms. This new computational capability is a game-changer for protein characterization efforts in biological defense,\" says Rafael Jaimes, a researcher in Lincoln Laboratory's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/counter-weapons-mass-destruction-systems\"&gt;Counter–Weapons of Mass Destruction Systems Group&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC's focus on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/impact/world-leader-interactive-supercomputing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;interactive supercomputing&lt;/a&gt; makes it especially useful to researchers. For years, the LLSC has pioneered software that lets users access its powerful systems without needing to be experts in configuring algorithms for parallel processing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The LLSC has always tried to make supercomputing feel like working on your laptop,\" Kepner says. \"The amount of data and the sophistication of analysis methods needed to be competitive today are well beyond what can be done on a laptop. But with our user-friendly approach, people can run their model and get answers quickly from their workspace.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond supporting programs solely at Lincoln Laboratory, TX-GAIN is enhancing research collaborations with MIT's campus. Such collaborations include the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.haystack.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Haystack Observatory&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cqe.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Quantum Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Beaver Works&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://aia.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Department of Air Force–MIT AI Accelerator.&lt;/a&gt; The latter initiative is rapidly prototyping, scaling, and applying AI technologies for the U.S. Air Force and Space Force,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/us-air-force-pilots-artificial-intelligence-assist-scheduling-aircrews-0708\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;optimizing flight scheduling&lt;/a&gt; for global operations as one fielded example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC systems are housed in an energy-efficient data center and facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Research staff in the LLSC are also tackling the immense&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/qa-vijay-gadepally-climate-impact-generative-ai\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;energy needs of AI&lt;/a&gt; and leading research into various&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/ai-models-are-devouring-energy-tools-reduce-consumption-are-here-if-data-centers-will-adopt\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;power-reduction methods&lt;/a&gt;. One software tool they developed can reduce the energy of training an AI model by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581784.3607034\"&gt;as much as 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The LLSC provides the capabilities needed to do leading-edge research, while in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner,\" Kepner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the supercomputers at the LLSC use the \"TX\" nomenclature in homage&amp;nbsp;to Lincoln Laboratory's Transistorized Experimental Computer Zero (TX-0) of 1956. TX-0 was one of the world's first transistor-based machines, and its 1958 successor,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/page/doc/2018-05/LookingBack_19_1.pdf\"&gt;TX-2&lt;/a&gt;, is storied for its role in pioneering human-computer interaction and AI.

While not all operations performed in a data center are AI-related, this total amount is slightly more than the energy consumption of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an August 2025 analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-ai-is-transforming-data-centers-and-ramping-up-power-demand\"&gt;global carbon emissions by about 220 million tons&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison, driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles produces about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics are staggering, but at the same time, scientists and engineers at MIT and around the world are studying innovations and interventions to mitigate AI’s ballooning carbon footprint, from boosting the efficiency of algorithms to rethinking the design of data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of reducing generative AI’s carbon footprint is typically centered on “operational carbon” — the emissions used by the powerful processors, known as GPUs, inside a data center. It often ignores “embodied carbon,” which are emissions created by building the data center in the first place, says Vijay Gadepally, senior scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who leads research projects in the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructing and retrofitting a data center, built from tons of steel and concrete and filled with air conditioning units, computing hardware, and miles of cable, consumes a huge amount of carbon. In fact, the environmental impact of building data centers is one reason companies like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.constructiondive.com/news/meta-piloting-mass-timber-for-sustainable-data-center-construction-clt-green-building/756919/\"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.esgdive.com/news/microsoft-swaps-concrete-steel-with-wood-in-data-centers-to-cut-emissions/731912/\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are exploring more sustainable building materials. (Cost is another factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, data centers are enormous buildings — the world’s largest, the China Telecomm-Inner Mongolia Information Park, engulfs&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://datacentremagazine.com/top10/top-10-biggest-data-centres\"&gt;roughly 10 million square feet&lt;/a&gt; — with about 10 to 50 times the energy density of a normal office building, Gadepally adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The operational side is only part of the story. Some things we are working on to reduce operational emissions may lend themselves to reducing embodied carbon, too, but we need to do more on that front in the future,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing operational carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures. For one, we can simply turn down the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have the worst lightbulbs in your house from an efficiency standpoint, turning them off or dimming them will always use less energy than leaving them running at full blast,” Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same fashion, research from the Supercomputing Center has shown that “turning down” the GPUs in a data center so they consume about &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/qa-vijay-gadepally-climate-impact-generative-ai-0113\"&gt;three-tenths the energy&lt;/a&gt; has minimal impacts on the performance of AI models, while also making the hardware easier to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to use less energy-intensive computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demanding generative AI workloads, such as training new reasoning models like GPT-5, usually need many GPUs working simultaneously. The Goldman Sachs analysis estimates that a state-of-the-art system could soon have as many as 576 connected GPUs operating at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But engineers can sometimes achieve similar results by reducing the precision of computing hardware, perhaps by switching to less powerful processors that have been tuned to handle a specific AI workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also measures that boost the efficiency of training power-hungry deep-learning models before they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gadepally’s group found that about half the electricity used for training an AI model is spent to get the last 2 or 3 percentage points in accuracy. Stopping the training process early can save a lot of that energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be cases where 70 percent accuracy is good enough for one particular application, like a recommender system for e-commerce,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also take advantage of efficiency-boosting measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a postdoc in the Supercomputing Center realized the group might run a thousand simulations during the training process to pick the two or three best AI models for their project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building a tool that allowed them to avoid about 80 percent of those wasted computing cycles, they dramatically reduced the energy demands of training with no reduction in model accuracy, Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging efficiency improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constant innovation in computing hardware, such as denser arrays of transistors on semiconductor chips, is still enabling dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though energy efficiency improvements have been slowing for most chips since about 2005, the amount of computation that GPUs can do per joule of energy has been improving by 50 to 60 percent each year, says Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a principal investigator at MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The still-ongoing ‘Moore’s Law’ trend of getting more and more transistors on chip still matters for a lot of these AI systems, since running operations in parallel is still very valuable for improving efficiency,” says Thomspon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significant, his group’s research indicates that efficiency gains from new model architectures that can solve complex problems faster, consuming less energy to achieve the same or better results, is doubling every eight or nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson coined the term “&lt;a href=\"https://ide.mit.edu/insights/the-importance-of-aigorithm-efficiency-can-nflops-hold-the-key-to-efficiency-gains/\"&gt;negaflop&lt;/a&gt;” to describe this effect. The same way a “negawatt” represents electricity saved due to energy-saving measures, a “negaflop” is a computing operation that doesn’t need to be performed due to algorithmic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could be things like “&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-techniques-efficiently-accelerate-sparse-tensors-1030\"&gt;pruning&lt;/a&gt;” away unnecessary components of a neural network or employing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2022/machine-learning-edge-microcontroller-1004\"&gt;compression techniques&lt;/a&gt; that enable users to do more with less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you need to use a really powerful model today to complete your task, in just a few years, you might be able to use a significantly smaller model to do the same thing, which would carry much less environmental burden. Making these models more efficient is the single-most important thing you can do to reduce the environmental costs of AI,” Thompson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing energy savings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reducing the overall energy use of AI algorithms and computing hardware will cut greenhouse gas emissions, not all energy is the same, Gadepally adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amount of carbon emissions in 1 kilowatt hour varies quite significantly, even just during the day, as well as over the month and year,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions. For instance, some generative AI workloads don’t need to be performed in their entirety at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting computing operations so some are performed later, when more of the electricity fed into the grid is from renewable sources like solar and wind, can go a long way toward reducing a data center’s carbon footprint, says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in the MIT Energy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deka and his team are also studying “smarter” data centers where the AI workloads of multiple companies using the same computing equipment are flexibly adjusted to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By looking at the system as a whole, our hope is to minimize energy use as well as dependence on fossil fuels, while still maintaining reliability standards for AI companies and users,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and others at MITEI are building a flexibility model of a data center that considers the differing energy demands of training a deep-learning model versus deploying that model. Their hope is to uncover the best strategies for scheduling and streamlining computing operations to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also exploring the use of long-duration energy storage units at data centers, which store excess energy for times when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these systems in place, a data center could use stored energy that was generated by renewable sources during a high-demand period, or avoid the use of diesel backup generators if there are fluctuations in the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-duration energy storage could be a game-changer here because we can design operations that really change the emission mix of the system to rely more on renewable energy,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers at MIT and Princeton University are developing a software tool for investment planning in the power sector, called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://energy.mit.edu/genx/\"&gt;GenX&lt;/a&gt;, which could be used to help companies determine the ideal place to locate a data center to minimize environmental impacts and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location can have a big impact on reducing a data center’s carbon footprint. For instance, Meta operates a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://datacenters.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Meta_s-Lulea-Data-Center.pdf\"&gt;data center in Lulea&lt;/a&gt;, a city on the coast of northern Sweden where cooler temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed to cool computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking farther outside the box (way farther), some governments are even exploring the construction of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-on-the-moon\"&gt;data centers on the moon&lt;/a&gt; where they could potentially be operated with nearly all renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-based solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the expansion of renewable energy generation here on Earth isn’t keeping pace with the rapid growth of AI, which is one major roadblock to reducing its carbon footprint, says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, a short-term lecturer, former Sloan Fellow, and former practice leader of climate and energy AI at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local, state, and federal review processes required for a new renewable energy projects can take years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are exploring the use of AI to speed up the process of connecting new renewable energy systems to the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a generative AI model could streamline interconnection studies that determine how a new project will impact the power grid, a step that often takes years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to &lt;a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128\"&gt;accelerating the development and implementation of clean energy technologies&lt;/a&gt;, AI could play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is great for tackling complex situations, and the electrical grid is said to be one of the largest and most complex machines in the world,” Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI could help optimize the prediction of solar and wind energy generation or identify ideal locations for new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also be used to perform predictive maintenance and fault detection for solar panels or other green energy infrastructure, or to monitor the capacity of transmission wires to maximize efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By helping researchers gather and analyze huge amounts of data, AI could also inform targeted policy interventions aimed at getting the biggest “bang for the buck” from areas such as renewable energy, Turliuk says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score is a framework that can be used to help determine the net climate impact of AI projects, considering emissions and other environmental costs along with potential environmental benefits in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the most effective solutions will likely result from collaborations among companies, regulators, and researchers, with academia leading the way, Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day counts. We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT_AI-Climate-01.jpg?itok=--5jq5Ns\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it,” says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, who is working to help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of generative AI. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense.”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainable-computing\">Sustainable computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/supercomputing\">Supercomputing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy-storage\">Energy storage</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/infrastructure\">Infrastructure</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-energy-initiative\">MIT Energy Initiative</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lincoln-laboratory-0\">Lincoln Laboratory</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>AI system learns from many types of scientific information and runs experiments to discover new materials</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-system-learns-many-types-scientific-information-and-runs-experiments-discovering-new-materials-0925</link>\n  <description>The new “CRESt” platform could help find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-system-learns-many-types-scientific-information-and-runs-experiments-discovering-new-materials-0925</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine-learning models can speed up the discovery of new materials by making predictions and suggesting experiments. But most models today only consider a few specific types of data or variables. Compare that with human scientists, who work in a collaborative environment and consider experimental results, the broader scientific literature, imaging and structural analysis, personal experience or intuition, and input from colleagues and peer reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a method for optimizing materials recipes and planning experiments that incorporates information from diverse sources like insights from the literature, chemical compositions, microstructural images, and more. The approach is part of a new platform, named Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), that also uses robotic equipment for high-throughput materials testing, the results of which are fed back into large multimodal models to further optimize materials recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human researchers can converse with the system in natural language, with no coding required, and the system makes its own observations and hypotheses along the way. Cameras and visual language models also allow the system to monitor experiments, detect issues, and suggest corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the field of AI for science, the key is designing new experiments,” says Ju Li, School of Engineering Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. “We use multimodal feedback — for example information from previous literature on how palladium behaved in fuel cells at this temperature, and human feedback — to complement experimental data and design new experiments. We also use robots to synthesize and characterize the material’s structure and to test performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is described in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09640-5\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers used CRESt to explore more than 900 chemistries and conduct 3,500 electrochemical tests, leading to the discovery of a catalyst material that delivered record power density in a fuel cell that runs on formate salt to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Li on the paper as first authors are&amp;nbsp;PhD student Zhen Zhang, Zhichu Ren PhD ’24, PhD student Chia-Wei Hsu, and postdoc&amp;nbsp;Weibin Chen. Their coauthors are MIT Assistant Professor Iwnetim Abate; Associate Professor Pulkit Agrawal; JR East Professor of Engineering Yang Shao-Horn; MIT.nano researcher Aubrey Penn; Zhang-Wei Hong PhD ’25, Hongbin Xu PhD ’25; Daniel Zheng PhD ’25; MIT graduate students Shuhan Miao and Hugh Smith; MIT postdocs Yimeng Huang, Weiyin Chen, Yungsheng Tian, Yifan Gao, and Yaoshen Niu; former MIT postdoc Sipei Li; and collaborators including Chi-Feng Lee, Yu-Cheng Shao, Hsiao-Tsu Wang, and Ying-Rui Lu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A smarter system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can be time-consuming and expensive. They require researchers to carefully design workflows, make new material, and run a series of tests and analysis to understand what happened. Those results are then used to decide how to improve the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve the process, some researchers have turned to a machine-learning strategy known as active learning to make efficient use of previous experimental data points and explore or exploit those data. When paired with a statistical technique known as Bayesian optimization (BO), active learning has helped researchers identify new materials for things like batteries and advanced semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bayesian optimization is like Netflix recommending the next movie to watch based on your viewing history, except instead it recommends the next experiment to do,” Li explains. “But basic Bayesian optimization is too simplistic. It uses a boxed-in design space, so if I say I’m going to use platinum, palladium, and iron, it only changes the ratio of those elements in this small space. But real materials have a lot more dependencies, and BO often gets lost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most active learning approaches also rely on single data streams that don’t capture everything that goes on in an experiment. To equip computational systems with more human-like knowledge, while still taking advantage of the speed and control of automated systems, Li and his collaborators built CRESt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRESt’s robotic equipment includes a liquid-handling robot, a carbothermal shock system to rapidly synthesize materials, an automated electrochemical workstation for testing, characterization equipment including automated electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and auxiliary devices such as pumps and gas valves, which can also be remotely controlled.&amp;nbsp; Many processing parameters can also be tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the user interface, researchers can chat with CRESt and tell it to use active learning to find promising materials recipes for different projects. CRESt can include up to 20 precursor molecules and substrates into its recipe. To guide material designs, CRESt’s models search through scientific papers for descriptions of elements or precursor molecules that might be useful. When human researchers tell CRESt to pursue new recipes, it kicks off a robotic symphony of sample preparation, characterization, and testing. The researcher can also ask CRESt to perform image analysis from scanning electron microscopy imaging, X-ray diffraction, and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information from those processes is used to train the active learning models, which use both literature knowledge and current experimental results to suggest further experiments and accelerate materials discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For each recipe we use previous literature text or databases, and it creates these huge representations of every recipe based on the previous knowledge base before even doing the experiment,” says Li. “We perform principal component analysis in this knowledge embedding space to get a reduced search space that captures most of the performance variability. Then we use Bayesian optimization in this reduced space to design the new experiment. After the new experiment, we feed newly acquired multimodal experimental data and human feedback into a large language model to augment the knowledgebase and redefine the reduced search space, which gives us a big boost in active learning efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can also face reproducibility challenges. To address the problem, CRESt monitors its experiments with cameras, looking for potential problems and suggesting solutions via text and voice to human researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used CRESt to develop an electrode material for an advanced type of high-density fuel cell known as a direct formate fuel cell. After exploring more than 900 chemistries over three months, CRESt discovered a catalyst material made from eight elements that achieved a 9.3-fold improvement in power density per dollar over pure palladium, an expensive precious metal. In further tests, CRESTs material was used to deliver a record power density to a working direct formate fuel cell even though the cell contained just one-fourth of the precious metals of previous devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show the potential for CRESt to find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A significant challenge for fuel-cell catalysts is the use of precious metal,” says Zhang. “For fuel cells, researchers have used various precious metals like palladium and platinum. We used a multielement catalyst that also incorporates many other cheap elements to create the optimal coordination environment for catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning species such as carbon monoxide and adsorbed hydrogen atom. People have been searching low-cost options for many years. This system greatly accelerated our search for these catalysts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A helpful assistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, poor reproducibility emerged as a major problem that limited the researchers’ ability to perform their new active learning technique on experimental datasets. Material properties can be influenced by the way the precursors are mixed and processed, and any number of problems can subtly alter experimental conditions, requiring careful inspection to correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To partially automate the process, the researchers coupled computer vision and vision language models with domain knowledge from the scientific literature, which allowed the system to hypothesize sources of irreproducibility and propose solutions. For example, the models can notice when there’s a millimeter-sized deviation in a sample’s shape or when a pipette moves something out of place. The researchers incorporated some of the model’s suggestions, leading to improved consistency, suggesting the models already make good experimental assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that humans still performed most of the debugging in their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CREST is an assistant, not a replacement, for human researchers,” Li says. “Human researchers are still indispensable. In fact, we use natural language so the system can explain what it is doing and present observations and hypotheses. But this is a step toward more flexible, self-driving labs.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Crest-01-press.jpg?itok=7kYJbO5h\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The CRESt user interface allows researchers to chat with the platform and tell it to deliver promising material recipes, start sample preparation, or perform image analysis on SEM images.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; figures courtesy of the researchers; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/materialsscienceandengineering\">Materials science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nanotech\">Nanoscience and nanotechnology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dmse\">DMSE</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitnano\">MIT.nano</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New AI system could accelerate clinical research</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925</link>\n  <description>By enabling rapid annotation of areas of interest in medical images, the tool can help scientists study new treatments or map disease progression.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Annotating regions of interest in medical images, a process known as segmentation, is often one of the first steps clinical researchers take when running a new study involving biomedical images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, to determine how the size of the brain’s hippocampus changes as patients age, the scientist first outlines each hippocampus in a series of brain scans. For many structures and image types, this is often a manual process that can be extremely time-consuming, especially if the regions being studied are challenging to delineate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To streamline the process, MIT researchers developed an artificial intelligence-based system that enables a researcher to rapidly segment new biomedical imaging datasets by clicking, scribbling, and drawing boxes on the images. This new AI model uses these interactions to predict the segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the user marks additional images, the number of interactions they need to perform decreases, eventually dropping to zero. The model can then segment each new image accurately without user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can do this because the model’s architecture has been specially designed to use information from images it has already segmented to make new predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other medical image segmentation models, this system allows the user to segment an entire dataset without repeating their work for each image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the interactive tool does not require a presegmented image dataset for training, so users don’t need machine-learning expertise or extensive computational resources. They can use the system for a new segmentation task without retraining the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, this tool could accelerate studies of new treatment methods and reduce the cost of clinical trials and medical research. It could also be used by physicians to improve the efficiency of clinical applications, such as radiation treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many scientists might only have time to segment a few images per day for their research because manual image segmentation is so time-consuming. Our hope is that this system will enable new science by allowing clinical researchers to conduct studies they were prohibited from doing before because of the lack of an efficient tool,” says Hallee Wong, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student and lead author of a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15058\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper on this new tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz PhD ’24; John Guttag, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; and senior author Adrian Dalca, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and MGH, and a research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The research will be presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlining segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are primarily two methods researchers use to segment new sets of medical images. With interactive segmentation, they input an image into an AI system and use an interface to mark areas of interest. The model predicts the segmentation based on those interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tool previously developed by the MIT researchers,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/scribbleprompt-helping-doctors-annotate-medical-scans-0909\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ScribblePrompt&lt;/a&gt;, allows users to do this, but they must repeat the process for each new image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to develop a task-specific AI model to automatically segment the images. This approach requires the user to manually segment hundreds of images to create a dataset, and then train a machine-learning model. That model predicts the segmentation for a new image. But the user must start the complex, machine-learning-based process from scratch for each new task, and there is no way to correct the model if it makes a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new system,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://multiverseg.csail.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;MultiverSeg&lt;/a&gt;, combines the best of each approach. It predicts a segmentation for a new image based on user interactions, like scribbles, but also keeps each segmented image in a context set that it refers to later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the user uploads a new image and marks areas of interest, the model draws on the examples in its context set to make a more accurate prediction, with less user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed the model’s architecture to use a context set of any size, so&amp;nbsp;the user doesn’t need to have a certain number of images. This gives MultiverSeg the flexibility to be used in a range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, for many tasks, you shouldn’t need to provide any interactions. If you have enough examples in the context set, the model can accurately predict the segmentation on its own,” Wong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers carefully engineered and trained the model on a diverse collection of biomedical imaging data to ensure it had the ability to incrementally improve its predictions based on user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user doesn’t need to retrain or customize the model for their data. To use MultiverSeg for a new task, one can upload a new medical image and start marking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers compared MultiverSeg to state-of-the-art tools for in-context and interactive image segmentation, it outperformed each baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer clicks, better results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike these other tools, MultiverSeg requires less user input with each image. By the ninth new image, it needed only two clicks from the user to generate a segmentation more accurate than a model designed specifically for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some image types, like X-rays, the user might only need to segment one or two images manually before the model becomes accurate enough to make predictions on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool’s interactivity also enables the user to make corrections to the model’s prediction, iterating until it reaches the desired level of accuracy. Compared to the researchers’ previous system, MultiverSeg reached 90 percent accuracy with roughly 2/3 the number of scribbles and 3/4 the number of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With MultiverSeg, users can always provide more interactions to refine the AI predictions. This still dramatically accelerates the process because it is usually faster to correct something that exists than to start from scratch,” Wong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers want to test this tool in real-world situations with clinical collaborators and improve it based on user feedback.

She believes it’s important to build relationships with policymakers, focusing on an evidence-driven approach to policy, while always remembering to center those the policies may affect. “We have to remember the people whose lives are impacted by business operations and legislation,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;She’s also aware of the complex intermixture of politics, social status, and financial obligations organizations and their employees have to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Though I’m studying workers, it’s important to consider the entire complex ecosystem when solving for these kinds of challenges, including firm incentives and global economic conditions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intersection of tech and labor policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang began investigating employee productivity, artificial intelligence, and related economic and labor market phenomena early in her time as a doctoral student, collaborating frequently with fellow PhD students in the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;A collaboration with economics doctoral student Shakked Noy yielded the 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating ChatGPT as a tool to improve productivity. Their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/study-finds-chatgpt-boosts-worker-productivity-writing-0714\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found it substantially increased workers’ productivity on writing tasks, most so for workers who initially performed the worst on the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This was one of the earliest pieces of evidence on the productivity effects of generative AI, and contributed to providing concrete data on how impactful these types of tools might be in the workplace and on the labor market,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In other ongoing research&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;“Determinants of Irregular Worker Schedules” —&amp;nbsp;Zhang is using data from a payroll provider to examine scheduling unpredictability, investigating why companies employ unpredictable schedules and how these schedules affect low-wage employees’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The scheduling project, conducted with MIT economics PhD student Nathan Lazarus, is motivated, in part, by existing sociological evidence that low-wage workers’ unpredictable schedules are associated with worse sleep and well-being. “We’ve seen a relationship between higher turnover and inconsistent, inadequate schedules, which suggests workers dis-prefer these kinds of schedules,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;At an academic roundtable, Zhang presented her results to Starbucks employees involved in scheduling and staffing. The attendees wanted to learn more about how different scheduling practices impacted workers and their productivity. “These are the kinds of questions that could reveal useful information for small businesses, large corporations, and others,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;By conducting this research, Zhang hopes to better understand whether or not scheduling regulations can improve affected employees’ quality of life, while also considering potential unintended consequences. “Why are these schedules set the way they’re set?” she asks. “Do businesses with these kinds of schedules require increased regulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Another project, conducted with MIT economics doctoral student Arjun Ramani, examines the linkages between offshoring, remote work, and related outcomes. “Do the technological and managerial practices that have made remote work possible further facilitate offshoring?” she asks. “Do organizations see significant gains in efficiency? What are the impacts on U.S. and offshore workers?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Her work is being funded through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program\"&gt;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://equitablegrowth.org/equitable-growth-awards-funding-to-early-career-scholars-studying-the-effects-of-economic-inequality/\"&gt;Washington Center for Equitable Growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting people at the center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang has observed the different kinds of people economics and higher education could bring together. She followed a dual enrollment track in high school, completing college-level courses with students from across a variety of demographic identities. “I enjoyed centering people in my work,” she says. “Taking classes with a diverse group of students, including veterans and mothers returning to school to complete their studies, made me more curious about socioeconomic issues and the policies relevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;She later enrolled at MIT, where she participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (&lt;a href=\"https://urop.mit.edu/\"&gt;UROP&lt;/a&gt;). She also completed an internship at the World Bank, worked as a summer analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and worked as an assistant for a diverse faculty cohort including MIT economists&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/david-h-autor\"&gt;David Autor&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-gruber\"&gt;Jon Gruber&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nina-roussille\"&gt;Nina Roussille&lt;/a&gt;. Autor is her primary advisor on her doctoral research, a mentor she cites as a significant influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“[Autor’s] course, 14.03 (Microeconomics and Public Policy), cemented connections between theory and practice,” she says. “I thought the class was revelatory in showing the kinds of questions economics can answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Doctoral study has revealed interesting pathways of investigation for Zhang, as have her relationships with her student peers and other faculty. She has, for example, leveraged faculty connections to gain access to hourly wage data in support of her scheduling and employee impacts work. “Generally, economists have had administrative data on earnings, but not on hours,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang’s focus on improving others’ lives extends to her work outside the classroom. She’s a mentor for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bcnc.net/find-a-program/child-and-youth-services/youth-program/\"&gt;Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center College Access Program&lt;/a&gt; and a member of MIT’s Graduate Christian Fellowship group. When she’s not enjoying spicy soups or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://harvarddb.com/\"&gt;paddling&lt;/a&gt; on the Charles, she takes advantage of opportunities to decompress with her art at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://arts.mit.edu/start/studios/\"&gt;W20 Arts Studios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“I wanted to create time for myself outside of research and the classroom,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang cites the benefits of MIT’s focus on cross-collaboration and encouraging students to explore other disciplines. As an undergraduate, Zhang minored in computer science, which taught her coding skills critical to her data work. Exposure to engineering also led her to become more interested in questions around how technology and workers interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Working with other scholars in the department has improved how Zhang conducts inquiries. “I’ve become the kind of well-rounded student and professional who can identify and quantify impacts, which is invaluable for future projects,” she says. Exposure to different academic and research areas, Zhang argues, helps increase access to ideas and information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-Whitney-Zhang.jpg?itok=2XIoq8ag\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“I’ve been interested in economics, economic impacts, and related social issues for a long time,” says Whitney Zhang.

With AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), the barrier to entry for these formal tools is dropping rapidly, making formal verification frameworks accessible to working mathematicians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathlib is a large, community-driven mathematical library for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" title=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" data-outlook-id=\"aec284c5-6738-43e8-a293-7ec08de2a2e8\"&gt;Lean&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;theorem prover, a formal system that verifies the correctness of every step in a proof.&amp;nbsp;Mathlib currently contains on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; mathematical results (such as lemmas, propositions, and theorems). The LMFDB,&amp;nbsp;a massive, collaborative online resource that serves as a kind of “encyclopedia” of modern number theory,&amp;nbsp;contains more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concrete statements.&amp;nbsp;Sutherland&amp;nbsp;and Roe are managing editors of the LMFDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roe and Sutherland’s grant will be used for a&amp;nbsp;project that aims to augment both systems, making the LMFDB’s results available within mathlib as assertions that have not yet been formally proved, and providing precise formal definitions of the numerical data stored within the LMFDB. This bridge will benefit both human mathematicians and AI agents, and provide a framework for connecting other mathematical databases to formal theorem-proving systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main obstacles to automating mathematical discovery and proof are the limited amount of formalized math knowledge, the high cost of formalizing complex results, and the gap between what is computationally accessible and what is feasible to formalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these obstacles, the researchers will use the funding to build tools for accessing the LMFDB from mathlib, making a large database of unformalized mathematical knowledge accessible to a formal proof system. This approach enables proof assistants to identify specific targets for formalization without the need to formalize the entire LMFDB corpus in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a large database of unformalized number-theoretic facts available within mathlib will provide a powerful technique for mathematical discovery, because the set of facts an agent might wish to consider while searching for a theorem or proof is exponentially larger than the set of facts that eventually need to be formalized in actually proving the theorem,” says Roe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that proving new theorems at the frontier of mathematical knowledge often&amp;nbsp;involves steps that rely on a nontrivial computation. For example, Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem uses what is known as the “3-5 trick” at a crucial point in the proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trick depends on the fact that the modular curve X_0(15) has only finitely many rational points, and none of those rational points correspond to a semi-stable elliptic curve,” according to&amp;nbsp;Sutherland. “This fact was known well before Wiles’ work, and is easy to verify using computational tools available in modern computer algebra systems, but it is not something one can realistically prove using pencil and paper, nor is it necessarily easy to formalize.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While formal theorem provers are being connected to computer algebra systems for more efficient verification, tapping into computational outputs in existing mathematical databases offers several other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stored results leverages the thousands of CPU-years of computation time already spent in creating the LMFDB, saving money that would be needed to redo these computations. Having precomputed information available also makes it feasible to search for examples or counterexamples without knowing ahead of time how broad the search can be. In addition, mathematical databases are curated repositories, not simply a random collection of facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that number theorists emphasized the role of the conductor in databases of elliptic curves has already proved to be crucial to one notable mathematical discovery made using machine learning tools:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/\" title=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/\" data-outlook-id=\"05d200f2-ffa0-4277-92e5-3fcf85b00cb9\"&gt;murmurations&lt;/a&gt;,” says&amp;nbsp;Sutherland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next steps are to build a team, engage with both the LMFDB and mathlib communities, start to formalize the definitions that underpin the elliptic curve, number field, and modular form sections of the LMFDB, and make it possible to run LMFDB searches from within mathlib,” says Roe. “If you are an MIT student interested in getting involved, feel free to reach out!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-mathematics-roe-sutherland.jpg?itok=GaIs7BPh\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Department of Mathematics researchers David Roe (left) and Andrew Sutherland</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Sandi Miller</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/awards\">Awards, honors and fellowships</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/funding\">Funding</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/staff\">Staff</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New tool makes generative AI models more likely to create breakthrough materials</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922</link>\n  <description>With SCIGEN, researchers can steer AI models to create materials with exotic properties for applications like quantum computing.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence models that turn text into images are also useful for generating new materials. Over the last few years, generative materials models from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have drawn on their training data to help researchers design tens of millions of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to designing materials with exotic quantum properties like superconductivity or unique magnetic states, those models struggle. That’s too bad, because humans could use the help. For example, after a decade of research into a class of materials that could revolutionize quantum computing, called quantum spin liquids, only a dozen material candidates have been identified. The bottleneck means there are fewer materials to serve as the basis for technological breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a technique that lets popular generative materials models create promising quantum materials by following specific design rules. The rules, or constraints, steer models to create materials with unique structures that give rise to quantum properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The models from these large companies generate materials optimized for stability,” says Mingda Li, MIT’s Class of 1947 Career Development Professor. “Our perspective is that’s not usually how materials science advances. We don’t need 10 million new materials to change the world. We just need one really good material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is described today in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02355-y\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published by &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties. From that pool, they synthesized two actual materials with exotic magnetic traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People in the quantum community really care about these geometric constraints, like the Kagome lattices that are two overlapping, upside-down triangles. We created materials with Kagome lattices because those materials can mimic the behavior of rare earth elements, so they are of high technical importance.” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li is the senior author of the paper. His MIT co-authors include PhD students Ryotaro Okabe,&amp;nbsp;Mouyang Cheng, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, and Denisse Cordova Carrizales; postdoc Manasi Mandal; undergraduate researchers Kiran Mak and Bowen Yu; visiting scholar Nguyen Tuan Hung; Xiang Fu ’22, PhD ’24; and professor of electrical engineering and computer science Tommi Jaakkola, who is an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. Additional co-authors include Yao Wang of Emory University, Weiwei Xie of Michigan State University, YQ Cheng of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Robert Cava of Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steering models toward impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A material’s properties are determined by its structure, and quantum materials are no different. Certain atomic structures are more likely to give rise to exotic quantum properties than others. For instance, square lattices can serve as a platform for high-temperature superconductors, while other shapes known as Kagome and Lieb lattices can support the creation of materials that could be useful for quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help a popular class of generative models known as a diffusion models produce materials that conform to particular geometric patterns, the researchers created SCIGEN (short for Structural Constraint Integration in GENerative model). SCIGEN is a computer code that ensures diffusion models adhere to user-defined constraints at each iterative generation step. With SCIGEN, users can give any generative AI diffusion model geometric structural rules to follow as it generates materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI diffusion models work by sampling from their training dataset to generate structures that reflect the distribution of structures found in the dataset. SCIGEN blocks generations that don’t align with the structural rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test SCIGEN, the researchers applied it to a popular AI materials generation model known as DiffCSP. They had the SCIGEN-equipped model generate materials with unique geometric patterns known as Archimedean lattices, which are collections of 2D lattice tilings of different polygons. Archimedean lattices can lead to a range of quantum phenomena and have been the focus of much research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Archimedean lattices give rise to quantum spin liquids and so-called flat bands, which can mimic the properties of rare earths without rare earth elements, so they are extremely important,” says Cheng, a co-corresponding author of the work. “Other Archimedean lattice materials have large pores that could be used for carbon capture and other applications, so it’s a collection of special materials. In some cases, there are no known materials with that lattice, so I think it will be really interesting to find the first material that fits in that lattice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model generated over 10 million material candidates with Archimedean lattices. One million of those materials survived a screening for stability. Using the supercomputers in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the researchers then took a smaller sample of 26,000 materials and ran detailed simulations to understand how the materials’ underlying atoms behaved. The researchers found magnetism in 41 percent of those structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that subset, the researchers synthesized two previously undiscovered compounds, TiPdBi and TiPbSb, at Xie and Cava’s labs. Subsequent experiments showed the AI model’s predictions largely aligned with the actual material’s properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to discover new materials that could have a huge potential impact by incorporating these structures that have been known to give rise to quantum properties,” says Okabe, the paper’s first author. “We already know that these materials with specific geometric patterns are interesting, so it’s natural to start with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating material breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum spin liquids could unlock quantum computing by enabling stable, error-resistant qubits that serve as the basis of quantum operations. But no quantum spin liquid materials have been confirmed. Xie and Cava believe SCIGEN could accelerate the search for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big search for quantum computer materials and topological superconductors, and these are all related to the geometric patterns of materials,” Xie says. “But experimental progress has been very, very slow,” Cava adds. “Many of these quantum spin liquid materials are subject to constraints: They have to be in a triangular lattice or a Kagome lattice. If the materials satisfy those constraints, the quantum researchers get excited; it’s a necessary but not sufficient condition. So, by generating many, many materials like that, it immediately gives experimentalists hundreds or thousands more candidates to play with to accelerate quantum computer materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work presents a new tool, leveraging machine learning, that can predict which materials will have specific elements in a desired geometric pattern,” says Drexel University Professor Steve May, who was not involved in the research. “This should speed up the development of previously unexplored materials for applications in next-generation electronic, magnetic, or optical technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that experimentation is still critical to assess whether AI-generated materials can be synthesized and how their actual properties compare with model predictions. Future work on SCIGEN could incorporate additional design rules into generative models, including chemical and functional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who want to change the world care about material properties more than the stability and structure of materials,” Okabe says. “With our approach, the ratio of stable materials goes down, but it opens the door to generate a whole bunch of promising materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the National Science Foundation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-genmaterial-01-press.jpg?itok=3ST3EvZG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties.

Over the last few years, no technology has changed that craft more than artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are predicting a rapid and complete transformation in how startups are built, the Trust Center’s leaders have a more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fundamentals of entrepreneurship haven’t changed with AI,” says Trust Center Entrepreneur in Residence Macauley Kenney. “There’s been a shift in how entrepreneurs accomplish tasks, and that trickles down into how you build a company, but we’re thinking of AI as another new tool in the toolkit. In some ways the world is moving a lot faster, but we also need to make sure the fundamental principles of entrepreneurship are well-understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach was on display during this summer’s delta v startup accelerator program, where many students regularly turned to AI tools but still ultimately relied on talking to their customers to make the right decisions for their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in this year’s cohort used AI tools to accelerate their coding, draft presentations, learn about new industries, and brainstorm ideas. The Trust Center is encouraging students to use AI as they see fit while also staying mindful of the technology’s limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center itself has also embraced AI, most notably through Jetpack, its generative AI app that walks users through the 24 steps of disciplined entrepreneurship outlined in Managing Director Bill Aulet’s &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2013/disciplined-entrepreneurship-bill-aulet-0826\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. When students input a startup idea, the tool can suggest customer segments, early markets to pursue, business models, pricing, and a product plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways the Trust Center wants students to use Jetpack is apparent in its name: It’s inspired by the acceleration a jetpack provides, but users still need to guide its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with AI technology’s current limitations, the Trust Center’s leaders acknowledge it can be a powerful tool for people at any stage of building a business, and their use of AI will continue to evolve with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s undeniable we’re in the midst of an AI revolution right now,” says Entrepreneur in Residence Ben Soltoff. “AI is reshaping a lot of things we do, and it’s also shaping how we do entrepreneurship and how students build companies. The Trust Center has recognized that for years, and we’ve welcomed AI into how we teach entrepreneurship at all levels, from the earliest stages of idea formation to exploring and testing those ideas and understanding how to commercialize and scale them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI’s strengths and weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, when the Trust Center’s delta v staff get together for strategic retreats, AI has been a central topic. The delta v program’s organizers think about how students can get the most out of the technology each year as they plan their summer-long curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with Orbit, the mobile app designed to help students find entrepreneurial resources, network with peers, access mentorship, and identify events and jobs. Jetpack was added to Orbit last year. It is trained on Aulet’s “Disciplined Entrepreneurship” as well as former Trust Center Executive Director Paul Cheek’s “&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-paul-cheek-startup-tactics-book-0503\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Startup Tactics&lt;/a&gt;” book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center describes Jetpack’s outputs as first drafts designed to help students brainstorm their next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to verify everything when you are using AI to build a business,” says Kenney, who is also a lecturer at MIT Sloan and MIT D-Lab. “I have yet to meet anyone who will base their business on the output of something like ChatGPT without verifying everything first. Sometimes, the verification can take longer than if you had done the research yourself from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company in this year’s cohort, Mendhai Health, uses AI and telehealth to offer personalized physical therapy for women struggling with pelvic floor dysfunction before and after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI has definitely made the entrepreneurial process more efficient and faster,” says MBA student Aanchal Arora. “Still, overreliance on AI, at least at this point, can hamper your understanding of customers. You need to be careful with every decision you make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney notes the way large language models are built can make them less useful for entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some AI tools can increase your speed by doing things like automatically sorting your email or helping you vibe code apps, but many AI tools are built off averages, and those can be less effective when you’re trying to connect with a very specific demographic,” Kenney says. “It’s not helpful to have AI tell you about an average person, you need to personally have strong validation that your specific customer exists. If you try to build a tool for an average person, you may build a tool for no one at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students eager to embrace AI may also be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tools available today. Fortunately, MIT students have a long history of being at the forefront of any new technology, and this year’s delta v cohort featured teams leveraging AI at the core of their solutions and in every step of their entrepreneurial journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Sloan MBA candidate Murtaza Jameel, whose company Cognify uses AI to simulates user interactions with websites and apps to improve digital experiences, describes his firm as an AI-native business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re building a design intelligence tool that replaces product testing with instant, predictive simulations of user behavior,” Jameel explains. “We’re trying to integrate AI into all of our processes: ideation, go to market, programming. All of our building has been done with AI coding tools. I have a custom bot that I’ve fed tons of information about our company to, and it’s a thought partner I’m speaking to every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more things change…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamentals the Trust Center doesn’t see changing is the need for students to get out of the lab or the classroom to talk to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are ways that AI can unlock new capabilities and make things move faster, but we haven’t turned our curriculum on its head because of AI,” Soltoff says. “In delta v, we stress first and foremost: What are you building and who are you building it for? AI alone can’t tell you who your customer is, what they want, and how you can better serve their needs. You need to go out into the world to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many of the biggest hurdles delta v teams faced this summer looked a lot like the hurdles entrepreneurs have always faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were prepared at the Trust Center to see a big change and to adapt to that, but the companies are still building and encountering the same challenges of customer identification, beachhead market identification, team dynamics,” Kenney says. “Those are still the big meaty challenges they’ve always been working on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid endless hype about AI agents and the future of work, many founders this summer still said the human side of delta v is what makes the program special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came to MIT with one goal: to start a technology company,” Jameel says. “The delta v program was on my radar when I was applying to MIT. The program gives you incredible access to resources — networks, mentorship, advisors. Some of the top folks in our industry are advising us now on how to build our company. It’s really unique. These are folks who have done what you’re doing 10 or 20 years ago, all just rooting for you. That’s why I came to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Entrepreneurs-01-press.jpg?itok=WovQMRvc\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The 2025 delta v accelerator cohort poses on stage for a group photo at the delta v demo day.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the Martin Trust Center</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/business\">Business and management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/martin-trust-center-mit-entrepreneurship\">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>What does the future hold for generative AI?</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919</link>\n  <description>At the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium Symposium, researchers and business leaders discussed potential advancements centered on this powerful technology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world in 2022, it brought generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and started a snowball effect that led to its rapid integration into industry, scientific research, health care, and the everyday lives of people who use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes next for this powerful but imperfect tool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that question in mind, hundreds of researchers, business leaders, educators, and students gathered at MIT’s Kresge Auditorium for the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium (MGAIC) Symposium on Sept. 17 to share insights and discuss the potential future of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal moment — generative AI is moving fast. It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/introducing-mit-generative-ai-impact-consortium-0203\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;consortium&lt;/a&gt; of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT_MGAIC_01-press.jpg?itok=RAAJ5NOt\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: Gretchen Ertl</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/special-events\">Special events and guest speakers</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/robotics\">Robotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/industry\">Industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/president-sally-kornbluth\">President Sally Kornbluth</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/provost\">Provost</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>How to build AI scaling laws for efficient LLM training and budget maximization</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-build-ai-scaling-laws-efficient-llm-training-budget-maximization-0916</link>\n  <description>MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers have developed a universal guide for estimating how large language models will perform based on smaller models in the same family.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-build-ai-scaling-laws-efficient-llm-training-budget-maximization-0916</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Lauren Hinkel | MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When researchers are building large language models (LLMs), they aim to maximize performance under a particular computational and financial budget. Since training a model can amount to millions of dollars, developers need to be judicious with cost-impacting decisions about, for instance, the model architecture, optimizers, and training datasets before committing to a model. To anticipate the quality and accuracy of a large model’s predictions, practitioners often turn to scaling laws: using smaller, cheaper models to try to approximate the performance of a much larger target model. The challenge, however, is that there are thousands of ways to create a scaling law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work from MIT and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers addresses this by amassing and releasing a collection of hundreds of models and metrics concerning training and performance to approximate more than a thousand scaling laws. From this, the team developed a meta-analysis and guide for how to select small models and estimate scaling laws for different LLM model families, so that the budget is optimally applied toward generating reliable performance predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The notion that you might want to try to build mathematical models of the training process is a couple of years old, but I think what was new here is that most of the work that people had been doing before is saying, ‘can we say something post-hoc about what happened when we trained all of these models, so that when we’re trying to figure out how to train a new large-scale model, we can make the best decisions about how to use our compute budget?’” says Jacob Andreas, associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and principal investigator with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning by Andreas, along with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers Leshem Choshen and Yang Zhang of IBM Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrapolating performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how you slice it, developing LLMs is an expensive endeavor: from decision-making regarding the numbers of parameters and tokens, data selection and size, and training techniques to determining output accuracy and tuning to the target applications and tasks. Scaling laws offer a way to forecast model behavior by relating a large model’s loss to the performance of smaller, less-costly models from the same family, avoiding the need to fully train every candidate. Mainly, the differences between the smaller models are the number of parameters and token training size. According to Choshen, elucidating scaling laws not only enable better pre-training decisions, but also democratize the field by enabling researchers without vast resources to understand and build effective scaling laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functional form of scaling laws is relatively simple, incorporating components from the small models that capture the number of parameters and their scaling effect, the number of training tokens and their scaling effect, and the baseline performance for the model family of interest. Together, they help researchers estimate a target large model’s performance loss; the smaller the loss, the better the target model’s outputs are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These laws allow research teams to weigh trade-offs efficiently and to test how best to allocate limited resources. They’re particularly useful for evaluating scaling of a certain variable, like the number of tokens, and for A/B testing of different pre-training setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, scaling laws aren’t new; however, in the field of AI, they emerged as models grew and costs skyrocketed. “It’s like scaling laws just appeared at some point in the field,” says Choshen. “They started getting attention, but no one really tested how good they are and what you need to do to make a good scaling law.” Further, scaling laws were themselves also a black box, in a sense. “Whenever people have created scaling laws in the past, it has always just been one model, or one model family, and one dataset, and one developer,” says Andreas. “There hadn’t really been a lot of systematic meta-analysis, as everybody is individually training their own scaling laws. So, [we wanted to know,] are there high-level trends that you see across those things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, Choshen, Andreas, and Zhang created a large dataset. They collected LLMs from 40 model families, including Pythia, OPT, OLMO, LLaMA, Bloom, T5-Pile, ModuleFormer mixture-of-experts, GPT, and other families. These included 485 unique, pre-trained models, and where available, data about their training checkpoints, computational cost (FLOPs), training epochs, and the seed, along with 1.9 million performance metrics of loss and downstream tasks. The models differed in their architectures, weights, and so on. Using these models, the researchers fit over 1,000 scaling laws and compared their accuracy across architectures, model sizes, and training regimes, as well as testing how the number of models, inclusion of intermediate training checkpoints, and partial training impacted the predictive power of scaling laws to target models. They used measurements of absolute relative error (ARE); this is the difference between the scaling law’s prediction and the observed loss of a large, trained model. With this, the team compared the scaling laws, and after analysis, distilled practical recommendations for AI practitioners about what makes effective scaling laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their shared guidelines walk the developer through steps and options to consider and expectations. First, it’s critical to decide on a compute budget and target model accuracy. The team found that 4 percent ARE is about the best achievable accuracy one could expect due to random seed noise, but up to 20 percent ARE is still useful for decision-making. The researchers identified several factors that improve predictions, like including intermediate training checkpoints, rather than relying only on final losses; this made scaling laws more reliable. However, very early training data before 10 billion tokens are noisy, reduce accuracy, and should be discarded. They recommend prioritizing training more models across a spread of sizes to improve robustness of the scaling law’s prediction, not just larger models; selecting five models provides a solid starting point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, including larger models improves prediction, but costs can be saved by partially training the target model to about 30 percent of its dataset and using that for extrapolation. If the budget is considerably constrained, developers should consider training one smaller model within the target model family and borrow scaling law parameters from a model family with similar architecture; however, this may not work for encoder–decoder models. Lastly, the MIT-IBM research group found that when scaling laws were compared across model families, there was strong correlation between two sets of hyperparameters, meaning that three of the five hyperparameters explained nearly all of the variation and could likely capture the model behavior. Together, these guidelines provide a systematic approach to making scaling law estimation more efficient, reliable, and accessible for AI researchers working under varying budget constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several surprises arose during this work: small models partially trained are still very predictive, and further, the intermediate training stages from a fully trained model can be used (as if they are individual models) for prediction of another target model. “Basically, you don’t pay anything in the training, because you already trained the full model, so the half-trained model, for instance, is just a byproduct of what you did,” says Choshen. Another feature Andreas pointed out was that, when aggregated, the variability across model families and different experiments jumped out and was noisier than expected. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that it’s possible to utilize the scaling laws on large models to predict performance down to smaller models. Other research in the field has hypothesized that smaller models were a “different beast” compared to large ones; however, Choshen disagrees. “If they’re totally different, they should have shown totally different behavior, and they don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this work focused on model training time, the researchers plan to extend their analysis to model inference. Andreas says it’s not, “how does my model get better as I add more training data or more parameters, but instead as I let it think for longer, draw more samples. I think there are definitely lessons to be learned here about how to also build predictive models of how much thinking you need to do at run time.” He says the theory of inference time scaling laws might become even more critical because, “it’s not like I'm going to train one model and then be done. [Rather,] it’s every time a user comes to me, they’re going to have a new query, and I need to figure out how hard [my model needs] to think to come up with the best answer. So, being able to build those kinds of predictive models, like we’re doing in this paper, is even more important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and a Sloan Research Fellowship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/Increasing-LLM-size.jpg?itok=I-0gEXtr\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Scaling laws enable researchers to use smaller LLMs to predict the performance of a significantly bigger target model, thus allowing better allocation of computational power.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: AdobeStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab\">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Machine-learning tool gives doctors a more detailed 3D picture of fetal health</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-tool-gives-doctors-more-detailed-3d-picture-fetal-health-0915</link>\n  <description>MIT CSAIL researchers developed a tool that can model the shape and movements of fetuses in 3D, potentially assisting doctors in finding abnormalities and making diagnoses.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-tool-gives-doctors-more-detailed-3d-picture-fetal-health-0915</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Alex Shipps | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-9f9513be-7fff-adbc-e573-265de5f3d249\"&gt;For pregnant women, ultrasounds are an informative (and sometimes necessary) procedure. They typically produce two-dimensional black-and-white scans of fetuses that can reveal key insights, including biological sex, approximate size, and abnormalities like heart issues or cleft lip. If your doctor wants a closer look, they may use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields to capture images that can be combined to create a 3D view of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MRIs aren’t a catch-all, though; the 3D scans are difficult for doctors to interpret well enough to diagnose problems because our visual system is not accustomed to processing 3D volumetric scans (in other words, a wrap-around look that also shows us the inner structures of a subject). Enter machine learning, which could help model a fetus’s development more clearly and accurately from data — although no such algorithm has been able to model their somewhat random movements and various body shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;That is, until a new approach called “Fetal SMPL” from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), and Harvard Medical School presented clinicians with a more detailed picture of fetal health. It was adapted from “SMPL” (Skinned Multi-Person Linear model), a 3D model developed in computer graphics to capture adult body shapes and poses, as a way to represent fetal body shapes and poses accurately. Fetal SMPL was then trained on 20,000 MRI volumes to predict the location and size of a fetus and create sculpture-like 3D representations. Inside each model is a skeleton with 23 articulated joints called a “kinematic tree,” which the system uses to pose and move like the fetuses it saw during training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The extensive, real-world scans that Fetal SMPL learned from helped it develop pinpoint accuracy. Imagine stepping into a stranger’s footprint while blindfolded, and not only does it fit perfectly, but you correctly guess what shoe they wore — similarly, the tool closely matched the position and size of fetuses in MRI frames it hadn’t seen before. Fetal SMPL was only misaligned by an average of about 3.1 millimeters, a gap smaller than a single grain of rice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approach could enable doctors to precisely measure things like the size of a baby’s head or abdomen and compare these metrics with healthy fetuses at the same age. Fetal SMPL has demonstrated its clinical potential in early tests, where it achieved accurate alignment results on a small group of real-world scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“It can be challenging to estimate the shape and pose of a fetus because they’re crammed into the tight confines of the uterus,” says lead author, MIT PhD student, and CSAIL researcher Yingcheng Liu SM ’21. “Our approach overcomes this challenge using a system of interconnected bones under the surface of the 3D model, which represent the fetal body and its motions realistically. Then, it relies on a coordinate descent algorithm to make a prediction, essentially alternating between guessing pose and shape from tricky data until it finds a reliable estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In utero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fetal SMPL was tested on shape and pose accuracy against the closest baseline the researchers could find: a system that models infant growth called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://files.is.tue.mpg.de/black/papers/miccai18.pdf\"&gt;“SMIL.”&lt;/a&gt; Since babies out of the womb are larger than fetuses, the team shrank those models by 75 percent to level the playing field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system outperformed this baseline on a dataset of fetal MRIs between the gestational ages of 24 and 37 weeks taken at Boston Children’s Hospital. Fetal SMPL was able to recreate real scans more precisely, as its models closely lined up with real MRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The method was efficient at lining up their models to images, only needing three iterations to arrive at a reasonable alignment. In an experiment that counted how many incorrect guesses Fetal SMPL had made before arriving at a final estimate, its accuracy plateaued from the fourth step onward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers have just begun testing their system in the real world, where it produced similarly accurate models in initial clinical tests. While these results are promising, the team notes that they’ll need to apply their results to larger populations, different gestational ages, and a variety of disease cases to better understand the system’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only skin deep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Liu also notes that their system only helps analyze what doctors can see on the surface of a fetus, since only bone-like structures lie beneath the skin of the models. To better monitor babies’ internal health, such as liver, lung, and muscle development, the team intends to make their tool volumetric, modeling the fetus’s inner anatomy from scans. Such upgrades would make the models more human-like, but the current version of Fetal SMPL already presents a precise (and unique) upgrade to 3D fetal health analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This study introduces a method specifically designed for fetal MRI that effectively captures fetal movements, enhancing the assessment of fetal development and health,” says Kiho Im, Harvard Medical School associate professor of pediatrics and staff scientist in the Division of Newborn Medicine at BCH’s Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center. Im, who was not involved with the paper, adds that this approach “will not only improve the diagnostic utility of fetal MRI, but also provide insights into the early functional development of the fetal brain in relation to body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This work reaches a pioneering milestone by extending parametric surface human body models for the earliest shapes of human life: fetuses,” says Sergi Pujades, an associate professor at University Grenoble Alpes, who wasn’t involved in the research. “It allows us to detangle the shape and motion of a human, which has already proven to be key in understanding how adult body shape relates to metabolic conditions and how infant motion relates to neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, the fact that the fetal model stems from, and is compatible with, the adult (SMPL) and infant (SMIL) body models, will allow us to study human shape and pose evolution over long periods of time. This is an unprecedented opportunity to further quantify how human shape growth and motion are affected by different conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu wrote the paper with three CSAIL members: Peiqi Wang SM ’22, PhD ’25; MIT PhD student Sebastian Diaz; and senior author Polina Golland, the Sunlin and Priscilla Chou Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a principal investigator in MIT CSAIL, and the leader of the Medical Vision Group. BCH assistant professor of pediatrics Esra Abaci Turk, Inria researcher Benjamin Billot, and Harvard Medical School professor of pediatrics and professor of radiology Patricia Ellen Grant are also authors on the paper.

The center will be part of the fourth phase of NNSA's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://psaap.llnl.gov/\"&gt;Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program&lt;/a&gt; (PSAAP-IV), which supports frontier research advancing the predictive capabilities of high-performance computing for open science and engineering applications relevant to national security mission spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://chefsi.mit.edu/\"&gt;Center for the Exascale Simulation of Coupled High-Enthalpy Fluid–Solid Interactions&lt;/a&gt; (CHEFSI) — a joint effort of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cse.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Center for Computational Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://computing.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://isn.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies&lt;/a&gt; (ISN) —&amp;nbsp;plans to harness &lt;a name=\"_Int_hvY0bt2J\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cutting-edge exascale supercomputers and next-generation algorithms to simulate with unprecedented detail how extremely hot, fast-moving gaseous and solid materials interact. The understanding of these extreme environments — characterized by temperatures of more than 1,500 degrees Celsius and speeds as high as Mach&amp;nbsp;25 — and their effect on vehicles is central to national security, space exploration, and the development of advanced thermal protection systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CHEFSI will capitalize on MIT’s deep strengths in predictive modeling, high-performance computing, and STEM education to help ensure the United States remains at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation,” says Ian A. Waitz, MIT’s vice president for research. “The center’s particular relevance to national security and advanced technologies exemplifies MIT’s commitment to advancing research with broad societal benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI is one of five new Predictive Simulation Centers announced by the NNSA as part of a program expected to provide up to $17.5 million to each center over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI’s research aims to couple detailed simulations of high-enthalpy gas flows with models of the chemical, thermal, and mechanical behavior of solid materials, capturing phenomena such as oxidation, nitridation, ablation, and fracture. Advanced computational models — validated by carefully designed experiments — can address the limitations of flight testing by providing critical insights into material performance and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating high-fidelity physics models with artificial intelligence-based surrogate models, experimental validation, and state-of-the-art exascale computational tools, CHEFSI will help us understand and predict how thermal protection systems perform under some of the harshest conditions encountered in engineering systems,” says Raúl Radovitzky, the Jerome C. Hunsaker Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, associate director of the ISN, and director of CHEFSI. “This knowledge will help in the design of resilient systems for applications ranging from reusable spacecraft to hypersonic vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radovitzky will be joined on the center’s leadership team by Youssef Marzouk, the Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, co-director of the MIT Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE), and recently named the associate dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing; and Nicolas Hadjiconstantinou, the Quentin Berg (1937) Professor of Mechanical Engineering and co-director of CCSE, who will serve as associate directors. The center&amp;nbsp;co-principal investigators include MIT faculty members across the departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Materials Science and Engineering, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering. Franklin Hadley will lead center operations, with administration and finance under the&amp;nbsp;purview of Joshua Freedman. Hadley and Freedman are both members of the ISN headquarters team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI expects to collaborate extensively with the DoE/NNSA national laboratories —&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories — and, in doing so, offer graduate students and postdocs immersive research experiences and internships at these facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/orion-reentry-00.jpg?itok=GkvaXXWN\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers in the new MIT Center for the Exascale Simulation of Coupled High-Enthalpy Fluid–Solid Interactions will study environments and material interactions such as those involved in the reentry of spacecraft into Earth's atmosphere.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Illustration: NASA</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/supercomputing\">Supercomputing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/space\">Space</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/security-studies\">Security studies and military</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dmse\">DMSE</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/doe\">Department of Energy (DoE)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>AI and machine learning for engineering design</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-machine-learning-for-engineering-design-0907</link>\n  <description>Popular mechanical engineering course applies machine learning and AI theory to real-world engineering design.</description>\n  <pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-machine-learning-for-engineering-design-0907</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Wilson | Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence optimization offers a host of benefits for mechanical engineers, including faster and more accurate designs and simulations, improved efficiency, reduced development costs through process automation, and enhanced predictive maintenance and quality control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people think about mechanical&amp;nbsp;engineering, they're thinking about basic mechanical tools like&amp;nbsp;hammers and … hardware like cars, robots, cranes, but mechanical engineering is very broad,” says Faez Ahmed, the Doherty Chair in Ocean Utilization and associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “Within mechanical engineering,&amp;nbsp;machine learning, AI, and optimization are playing a big role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ahmed’s course, &lt;a href=\"https://meche.mit.edu/featured-classes/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-engineering-design\"&gt;2.155/156&lt;/a&gt; (AI and Machine Learning for Engineering Design), students use tools and techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning for mechanical engineering design, focusing on the creation of new products and addressing engineering design challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of reason for mechanical engineers to think about machine learning and AI to essentially expedite the design process,” says Lyle Regenwetter, a teaching assistant for the course and a PhD candidate in Ahmed’s Design Computation and Digital Engineering Lab (DeCoDE), where research focuses on developing new machine learning and optimization methods to study complex engineering design problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First offered in 2021, the class has quickly become one of the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE)’s most popular non-core offerings, attracting students from departments across the Institute, including mechanical and civil and environmental engineering, aeronautics and astronautics, the MIT Sloan School of Management, and nuclear and computer science, along with cross-registered students from Harvard University and other schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course, which is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, focuses on the implementation of advanced machine learning and optimization strategies in the context of real-world mechanical design problems.&amp;nbsp;From designing&amp;nbsp;bike frames to city grids, students participate in contests related to AI for physical systems and&amp;nbsp;tackle optimization challenges in a class environment fueled by friendly competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students are given challenge problems and starter code that “gave a solution, but [not] the best solution …” explains Ilan Moyer, a graduate student in MechE. “Our task was to [determine],&amp;nbsp;how can we do better?” Live leaderboards encourage students to continually refine their methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Em Lauber, a system design and management graduate student, says the process gave space to explore the application of what students were learning and the practice skill of “literally how to code it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curriculum incorporates discussions on research papers, and students also pursue hands-on exercises in machine learning tailored to specific engineering issues including robotics, aircraft, structures, and metamaterials. For their final project, students work together on a team project that employs AI techniques for design on a complex problem of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is wonderful to see the diverse breadth and high quality of class projects,” says Ahmed. “Student projects from this course often lead to research publications, and have even led to awards.” He cites the example of a recent paper, titled “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23287\"&gt;GenCAD-Self-Repairing&lt;/a&gt;,” that went on to win the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Systems Engineering, Information and Knowledge Management 2025 Best Paper Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best part about the final project was that it gave every student the opportunity to apply what they’ve learned in the class to an area that interests them a lot,” says Malia Smith, a graduate student in MechE. Her project chose “markered motion captured data” and looked at predicting ground force for runners, an effort she called “really gratifying” because it worked so much better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauber took the framework of a “cat tree” design with different modules of poles, platforms, and ramps to create customized solutions for individual cat households, while Moyer created software that is designing a new type of 3D printer architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you see machine learning in popular culture, it’s very abstracted, and you have the sense that there’s something very complicated going on,” says Moyer. “This class has opened the curtains.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-AI-Design-B_0.jpg?itok=MPVjWyPQ\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT mechanical engineering graduate student Malia Smith (left) asks teaching assistant Noah Bagazinski for feedback on her final project for course 2.155/156 (AI and Machine Learning for Engineering Design).</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Lauren Futami</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/students\">Students</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/design\">Design</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/civil-engineering\">Civil and environmental engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A greener way to 3D print stronger stuff</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/greener-way-3d-print-stronger-stuff-0904</link>\n  <description>MIT CSAIL researchers developed SustainaPrint, a system that reinforces only the weakest zones of eco-friendly 3D prints, achieving strong results with less plastic.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/greener-way-3d-print-stronger-stuff-0904</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-8a16a100-7fff-866e-17d3-0c98f0ab7768\"&gt;3D printing has come a long way since its invention in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who pioneered stereolithography, a technique that solidifies liquid resin into solid objects using ultraviolet lasers. Over the decades, 3D printers have evolved from experimental curiosities into tools capable of producing everything from custom prosthetics to complex food designs, architectural models, and even functioning human organs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;But as the technology matures, its environmental footprint has become increasingly difficult to set aside. The vast majority of consumer and industrial 3D printing still relies on petroleum-based plastic filament. And while “greener” alternatives made from biodegradable or recycled materials exist, they come with a serious trade-off: they’re often not as strong. These eco-friendly filaments tend to become brittle under stress, making them ill-suited for structural applications or load-bearing parts — exactly where strength matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;This trade-off between sustainability and mechanical performance prompted researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Hasso Plattner Institute to ask: Is it possible to build objects that are mostly eco-friendly, but still strong where it counts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Their answer is &lt;a href=\"https://maxineaps.github.io/sustainaprint-project-site/\"&gt;SustainaPrint&lt;/a&gt;, a new software and hardware toolkit designed to help users strategically combine strong and weak filaments to get the best of both worlds. Instead of printing an entire object with high-performance plastic, the system analyzes a model through finite element analysis simulations, predicts where the object is most likely to experience stress, and then reinforces just those zones with stronger material. The rest of the part can be printed using greener, weaker filament, reducing plastic use while preserving structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Our hope is that SustainaPrint can be used in industrial and distributed manufacturing settings one day, where local material stocks may vary in quality and composition,” says MIT PhD student and CSAIL researcher Maxine Perroni-Scharf, who is a lead author on a &lt;a href=\"https://maxineaps.github.io/sustainaprint-project-site/\"&gt;paper presenting the project&lt;/a&gt;. “In these contexts, the testing toolkit could help ensure the reliability of available filaments, while the software’s reinforcement strategy could reduce overall material consumption without sacrificing function.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For their experiments, the team used Polymaker’s PolyTerra PLA as the eco-friendly filament, and standard or Tough PLA from Ultimaker for reinforcement. They used a 20 percent reinforcement threshold to show that even a small amount of strong plastic goes a long way. Using this ratio, SustainaPrint was able to recover up to 70 percent of the strength of an object printed entirely with high-performance plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;They printed dozens of objects, from simple mechanical shapes like rings and beams to more functional household items such as headphone stands, wall hooks, and plant pots. Each object was printed three ways: once using only eco-friendly filament, once using only strong PLA, and once with the hybrid SustainaPrint configuration. The printed parts were then mechanically tested by pulling, bending, or otherwise breaking them to measure how much force each configuration could withstand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In many cases, the hybrid prints held up nearly as well as the full-strength versions. For example, in one test involving a dome-like shape, the hybrid version outperformed the version printed entirely in Tough PLA. The team believes this may be due to the reinforced version’s ability to distribute stress more evenly, avoiding the brittle failure sometimes caused by excessive stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This indicates that in certain geometries and loading conditions, mixing materials strategically may actually outperform a single homogenous material,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It’s a reminder that real-world mechanical behavior is full of complexity, especially in 3D printing, where interlayer adhesion and tool path decisions can affect performance in unexpected ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lean, green, eco-friendly printing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;SustainaPrint starts off by letting a user upload their 3D model into a custom interface. By selecting fixed regions and areas where forces will be applied, the software then uses an approach called “Finite Element Analysis” to simulate how the object will deform under stress. It then creates a map showing pressure distribution inside the structure, highlighting areas under compression or tension, and applies heuristics to segment the object into two categories: those that need reinforcement, and those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Recognizing the need for accessible and low-cost testing, the team also developed a DIY testing toolkit to help users assess strength before printing. The kit has a 3D-printable device with modules for measuring both tensile and flexural strength. Users can pair the device with common items like pull-up bars or digital scales to get rough, but reliable performance metrics. The team benchmarked their results against manufacturer data and found that their measurements consistently fell within one standard deviation, even for filaments that had undergone multiple recycling cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Although the current system is designed for dual-extrusion printers, the researchers believe that with some manual filament swapping and calibration, it could be adapted for single-extruder setups, too. In current form, the system simplifies the modeling process by allowing just one force and one fixed boundary per simulation. While this covers a wide range of common use cases, the team sees future work expanding the software to support more complex and dynamic loading conditions. The team also sees potential in using AI to infer the object’s intended use based on its geometry, which could allow for fully automated stress modeling without manual input of forces or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D for free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers plan to release SustainaPrint open-source, making both the software and testing toolkit available for public use and modification. Another initiative they aspire to bring to life in the future: education. “In a classroom, SustainaPrint isn’t just a tool, it’s a way to teach students about material science, structural engineering, and sustainable design, all in one project,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It turns these abstract concepts into something tangible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;As 3D printing becomes more embedded in how we manufacture and prototype everything from consumer goods to emergency equipment, sustainability concerns will only grow. With tools like SustainaPrint, those concerns no longer need to come at the expense of performance. Instead, they can become part of the design process: built into the very geometry of the things we make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Co-author Patrick Baudisch, who is a professor at the Hasso Plattner Institute, adds that “the project addresses a key question: What is the point of collecting material for the purpose of recycling, when there is no plan to actually ever use that material? Maxine presents the missing link between the theoretical/abstract idea of 3D printing material recycling and what it actually takes to make this idea relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Perroni-Scharf and Baudisch wrote the paper with CSAIL research assistant Jennifer Xiao; MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science master’s student Cole Paulin ’24; master’s student Ray Wang SM ’25 and PhD student Ticha Sethapakdi SM ’19 (both CSAIL members); Hasso Plattner Institute PhD student Muhammad Abdullah; and Associate Professor Stefanie Mueller, lead of the Human-Computer Interaction Engineering Group at CSAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers’ work was supported by a Designing for Sustainability Grant from the Designing for Sustainability MIT-HPI Research Program. Their work will be presented at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in September.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-csail-SustainaPrint.jpg?itok=lSAi4Ddm\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new software and hardware toolkit called SustainaPrint can help users strategically combine strong and weak filaments to achieve the best of both worlds.

These have had limited success, in part because until now they have not been grounded in an understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the laws of conservation of mass. Now, a team of researchers at MIT has come up with a way of incorporating these physical constraints on a reaction prediction model, and thus greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work was &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09426-9\"&gt;reported Aug. 20 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by recent postdoc Joonyoung Joung (now an assistant professor at Kookmin University, South Korea); former software engineer Mun Hong Fong (now at Duke University); chemical engineering graduate student Nicholas Casetti; postdoc Jordan Liles; physics undergraduate student Ne Dassanayake; and senior author Connor Coley, who is the Class of 1957 Career Development Professor in the MIT departments of Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prediction of reaction outcomes is a very important task,” Joung explains. For example, if you want to make a new drug, “you need to know how to make it. So, this requires us to know what product is likely” to result from a given set of chemical inputs to a reaction. But most previous efforts to carry out such predictions look only at a set of inputs and a set of outputs, without looking at the intermediate steps or considering the constraints of ensuring that no mass is gained or lost in the process, which is not possible in actual reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joung points out that while large language models such as ChatGPT have been very successful in many areas of research, these models do not provide a way to limit their outputs to physically realistic possibilities, such as by requiring them to adhere to conservation of mass. These models use computational “tokens,” which in this case represent individual atoms, but “if you don’t conserve the tokens, the LLM model starts to make new atoms, or deletes atoms in the reaction.” Instead of being grounded in real scientific understanding, “this is kind of like alchemy,” he says. While many attempts at reaction prediction only look at the final products, “we want to track all the chemicals, and how the chemicals are transformed” throughout the reaction process from start to end, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to address the problem, the team made use of a method developed back in the 1970s by chemist Ivar Ugi, which uses a bond-electron matrix to represent the electrons in a reaction. They used this system as the basis for their new program, called FlowER (Flow matching for Electron Redistribution), which allows them to explicitly keep track of all the electrons in the reaction to ensure that none are spuriously added or deleted in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses a matrix to represent the electrons in a reaction, and uses nonzero values to represent bonds or lone electron pairs and zeros to represent a lack thereof. “That helps us to conserve both atoms and electrons at the same time,” says Fong. This representation, he says, was one of the key elements to including mass conservation in their prediction system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system they developed is still at an early stage, Coley says. “The system as it stands is a demonstration — a proof of concept that this generative approach of flow matching is very well suited to the task of chemical reaction prediction.” While the team is excited about this promising approach, he says, “we’re aware that it does have specific limitations as far as the breadth of different chemistries that it’s seen.” Although the model was trained using data on more than a million chemical reactions, obtained from a U.S. Patent Office database, those data do not include certain metals and some kinds of catalytic reactions, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re incredibly excited about the fact that we can get such reliable predictions of chemical mechanisms” from the existing system, he says. “It conserves mass, it conserves electrons, but we certainly acknowledge that there’s a lot more expansion and robustness to work on in the coming years as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even in its present form, which is being made freely available through the online platform GitHub, “we think it will make accurate predictions and be helpful as a tool for assessing reactivity and mapping out reaction pathways,” Coley says. “If we’re looking toward the future of really advancing the state of the art of mechanistic understanding and helping to invent new reactions, we’re not quite there. But we hope this will be a steppingstone toward that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all open source,” says Fong. “The models, the data, all of them are up there,” including a previous dataset developed by Joung that exhaustively lists the mechanistic steps of known reactions. “I think we are one of the pioneering groups making this dataset, and making it available open-source, and making this usable for everyone,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlowER model matches or outperforms existing approaches in finding standard mechanistic pathways, the team says, and makes it possible to generalize to previously unseen reaction types. They say the model could potentially be relevant for predicting reactions for medicinal chemistry, materials discovery, combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and electrochemical systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their comparisons with existing reaction prediction systems, Coley says, “using the architecture choices that we’ve made, we get this massive increase in validity and conservation, and we get a matching or a little bit better accuracy in terms of performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that “what’s unique about our approach is that while we are using these textbook understandings of mechanisms to generate this dataset, we’re anchoring the reactants and products of the overall reaction in experimentally validated data from the patent literature.”&amp;nbsp;They are inferring the underlying mechanisms, he says, rather than just making them up. “We’re imputing them from experimental data, and that’s not something that has been done and shared at this kind of scale before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step, he says, is “we are quite interested in expanding the model’s understanding of metals and catalytic cycles. We’ve just scratched the surface in this first paper,” and most of the reactions included so far don’t include metals or catalysts, “so that’s a direction we’re quite interested in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, he says, “a lot of the excitement is in using this kind of system to help discover new complex reactions and help elucidate new mechanisms. I think that the long-term potential impact is big, but this is of course just a first step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis consortium and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-flower.jpg?itok=xtPoC4hU\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The FlowER (Flow matching for Electron Redistribution) system allows a researcher to explicitly keep track of all the electrons in a reaction to ensure that none are spuriously added or deleted in the process of predicting the outcome of a chemical reaction.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image courtesy of the researchers.</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-source\">Open source</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nsf\">National Science Foundation (NSF)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>3 Questions: The pros and cons of synthetic data in AI </title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-pros-cons-synthetic-data-ai-kalyan-veeramachaneni-0903</link>\n  <description>Artificially created data offer benefits from cost savings to privacy preservation, but their limitations require careful planning and evaluation, Kalyan Veeramachaneni says.  </description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-pros-cons-synthetic-data-ai-kalyan-veeramachaneni-0903</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthetic data are artificially generated by algorithms to mimic the statistical properties of actual data, without containing any information from real-world sources. While concrete numbers are hard to pin down, some estimates suggest that more than 60 percent of data used for AI applications in 2024 was synthetic, and this figure is expected to grow across industries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because synthetic data don’t contain real-world information, they hold the promise of safeguarding privacy while reducing the cost and increasing the speed at which new AI models are developed. But&amp;nbsp;using synthetic data requires careful&amp;nbsp;evaluation, planning, and checks and balances to prevent loss of performance when AI models are deployed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To unpack some pros and cons of using synthetic data,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a principal research scientist in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems&amp;nbsp;and co-founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://datacebo.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DataCebo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;whose open-core platform,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Synthetic Data Vault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;users generate and test synthetic data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;How are synthetic data created?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Synthetic data are algorithmically generated but do not come from a real situation. Their value lies in their statistical similarity to real data. If we’re talking about language, for instance, synthetic data look very much as if a human had written those sentences. While researchers have created synthetic data for a long time, what has changed in the past few years is our ability to build generative models out of data and use them to create realistic synthetic data. We can take a little bit of real data and build a generative model from that, which we can use to create as much synthetic data as we want. Plus, the model creates synthetic data in a way that captures all the underlying rules and infinite patterns that exist in the real data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are essentially&amp;nbsp;four&amp;nbsp;different data modalities: language, video or images,&amp;nbsp;audio,&amp;nbsp;and tabular data. All four&amp;nbsp;of them have slightly different ways of building the generative models to create synthetic data. An LLM, for instance, is nothing but a generative model from which you are sampling synthetic data when you ask it a question.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of language and image data are publicly available on the internet. But tabular data, which is the data collected when we interact with physical and social systems, is often locked up behind enterprise firewalls. Much of it is sensitive or private, such as customer transactions stored by a bank. For this type of data, platforms like the Synthetic Data Vault provide software that can be used to build generative models. Those models then create synthetic data that preserve customer privacy and can be shared more widely.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One powerful thing about this generative modeling approach for synthesizing data is that enterprises can now build a customized, local model for their own data. Generative AI automates what used to be a manual process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What are some benefits of using synthetic data, and which use-cases and applications are they particularly well-suited for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One fundamental application which has grown tremendously over the past decade is using synthetic data to test software applications. There is data-driven logic behind many software applications, so you need data to test that software and its functionality. In the past, people have resorted to manually generating data, but now we can use generative models to create as much data as we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also create specific data for application testing. Say I work for an e-commerce company. I can generate synthetic data that mimics real customers who live in Ohio and made transactions pertaining to one particular product in February or March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because synthetic data aren’t drawn from real situations, they are also privacy-preserving. One of the biggest problems in software testing has been getting access to sensitive real data for testing software in non-production environments, due to privacy concerns.&amp;nbsp;Another immediate benefit is in performance testing. You can create a billion transactions from a generative model and test how fast your system can process them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another application where synthetic data hold a lot of promise is in training machine-learning models. Sometimes, we want an AI model to help us predict an event that is less frequent. A bank may want to use an AI model to predict fraudulent transactions, but there may be too few real examples to train a model that can identify fraud accurately.&amp;nbsp;Synthetic data provide data augmentation — additional data examples that are similar to the real data. These can significantly improve the accuracy of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes users don’t have time or the financial resources to collect all the data. For instance, collecting data about customer intent would require conducting many surveys. If you end up with limited data and then try to train a model, it won’t perform well. You can augment by adding synthetic data to train those models better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What are some of the risks or potential pitfalls of using synthetic data, and are there steps users can take to prevent or mitigate those problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the biggest questions people often have in their mind is, if the data are synthetically created, why should I trust them? Determining whether you can trust the data often comes down to evaluating the overall system where you are using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of aspects of synthetic data we have been able to evaluate for a long time. For instance, there are existing methods to measure how close synthetic data are to real data, and we can measure their quality and whether they preserve privacy. But there are other important considerations if you are using those synthetic data to train a machine-learning model for a new use case. How would you know the data are going to lead to models that still make valid conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New efficacy metrics are emerging, and the emphasis is now on efficacy for a particular task. You must really dig into your workflow to ensure the synthetic data you add to the system still allow you to draw valid conclusions. That is something that must be done carefully on an application-by-application basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bias can also be an issue. Since it is created from a small amount of real data, the same bias that exists in the real data can carry over into the synthetic data. Just like with real data, you would need to purposefully make sure the bias is removed through different sampling techniques, which can create balanced datasets. It takes some careful planning, but you can calibrate the data generation to prevent the proliferation of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with the evaluation process, our group created the &lt;a href=\"https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Synthetic Data Metrics Library&lt;/a&gt;. We worried that people would use synthetic data in their environment and it would give different conclusions in the real world. We created a metrics and evaluation library to&amp;nbsp;ensure&amp;nbsp;checks and balances. The machine learning community has faced a lot of challenges in ensuring models can generalize to new situations. The use of synthetic data adds a whole new dimension to that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect that the old systems of working with data, whether to build software applications, answer analytical questions, or train models, will dramatically change as we get more sophisticated at building these generative models. A lot of things we have never been able to do before will now be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-3Q-Synthetic-01-press.jpg?itok=kGcQGLUI\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Kalyan Veeramachaneni spoke with MIT News about the pros and cons of using synthetic data.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/interview\">Interview</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>3 Questions: On biology and medicine’s “data revolution”</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-caroline-uhler-biology-medicine-data-revolution-0902</link>\n  <description>Professor Caroline Uhler discusses her work at the Schmidt Center, thorny problems in math, and the ongoing quest to understand some of the most complex interactions in biology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:45:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-caroline-uhler-biology-medicine-data-revolution-0902</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jane Halpern | Elvira Forte | Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caroline Uhler is&amp;nbsp;an Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Engineering at MIT; a professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the Institute for Data, Science, and Society (IDSS);&amp;nbsp;and director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she is also a core institute and scientific leadership team member.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uhler is interested in all the methods by which scientists can uncover causality in biological systems, ranging from causal discovery on observed variables to causal feature learning and representation learning.&amp;nbsp;In this interview, she discusses machine learning in biology, areas that are ripe for problem-solving, and cutting-edge research coming out of the Schmidt Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center has four distinct areas of focus structured around four natural levels of biological organization: proteins, cells, tissues, and organisms. What, within the current landscape of machine learning, makes&amp;nbsp;now the right time to work on these specific problem classes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Biology and medicine are currently undergoing a “data revolution.” The availability of large-scale, diverse datasets — ranging from genomics and multi-omics to high-resolution imaging and electronic health records — makes this an opportune time. Inexpensive and accurate DNA sequencing is a reality, advanced molecular imaging has become routine, and single cell genomics is allowing the profiling of millions of cells. These innovations — and the massive datasets they produce — have brought us to the threshold of a new era in biology, one where we will be able to move beyond characterizing the units of life (such as all proteins, genes, and cell types) to understanding the `programs of life’, such as the logic of gene circuits and cell-cell communication that underlies tissue patterning and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the genotype-phenotype map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;At the same time, in the past decade, machine learning has seen remarkable progress with models like BERT, GPT-3, and ChatGPT demonstrating advanced capabilities in text understanding and generation, while vision transformers and multimodal models like CLIP have achieved human-level performance in image-related tasks. These breakthroughs provide powerful architectural blueprints and training strategies that can be adapted to biological data. For instance, transformers can model genomic sequences similar to language, and vision models can analyze medical and microscopy images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Importantly, biology is poised to be not just a beneficiary of machine learning, but also a significant source of inspiration for new ML research. Much like agriculture and breeding spurred modern statistics, biology has the potential to inspire new and perhaps even more profound avenues of ML research. Unlike fields such as recommender systems and internet advertising, where there are no natural laws to discover and predictive accuracy is the ultimate measure of value, in biology, phenomena are physically interpretable, and causal mechanisms are the ultimate goal. Additionally, biology boasts genetic and chemical tools that enable perturbational screens on an unparalleled scale compared to other fields. These combined features make biology uniquely suited to both benefit greatly from ML and serve as a profound wellspring of inspiration for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Taking a somewhat different tack, what problems in biology are still really resistant to our current tool set? Are there areas, perhaps specific challenges in disease or in wellness, which you feel are ripe for problem-solving?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable success in predictive tasks across domains such as image classification, natural language processing, and clinical risk modeling. However, in the biological sciences, predictive accuracy is often insufficient. The fundamental questions in these fields are inherently causal: How does a perturbation to a specific gene or pathway affect downstream cellular processes? What is the mechanism by which an intervention leads to a phenotypic change? Traditional machine learning models, which are primarily optimized for capturing statistical associations in observational data, often fail to answer such interventional queries.There is a strong need for biology and medicine to also inspire new foundational developments in machine learning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field is now equipped with high-throughput perturbation technologies — such as pooled CRISPR screens, single-cell transcriptomics, and spatial profiling — that generate rich datasets under systematic interventions. These data modalities naturally call for the development of models that go beyond pattern recognition to support causal inference, active experimental design, and representation learning in settings with complex, structured latent variables. From a mathematical perspective, this requires tackling core questions of identifiability, sample efficiency, and the integration of combinatorial, geometric, and probabilistic tools. I believe that addressing these challenges will not only unlock new insights into the mechanisms of cellular systems, but also push the theoretical boundaries of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to foundation models, a consensus in the field is that we are still far from creating a holistic foundation model for biology across scales, similar to what ChatGPT represents in the language domain — a sort of digital organism capable of simulating all biological phenomena. While new foundation models emerge almost weekly, these models have thus far been specialized for a specific scale and question, and focus on one or a few modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant progress has been made in predicting protein structures from their sequences. This success has highlighted the importance of iterative machine learning challenges, such as CASP (critical assessment of structure prediction), which have been instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms for protein structure prediction and driving their improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schmidt Center is organizing challenges to increase awareness in the ML field and make progress in the development of methods to solve causal prediction problems that are so critical for the biomedical sciences. With the increasing availability of single-gene perturbation data at the single-cell level,&amp;nbsp;I believe predicting the effect of single or combinatorial perturbations, and which perturbations could drive a desired phenotype, are solvable problems. With our Cell Perturbation Prediction Challenge (CPPC), we aim to provide the means to objectively test and benchmark algorithms for predicting the effect of new perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the field has made remarkable strides is disease diagnostic and patient triage. Machine learning algorithms can integrate different sources of patient information (data modalities), generate missing modalities, identify patterns that may be difficult for us to detect, and help stratify patients based on their disease risk. While we must remain cautious about potential biases in model predictions, the danger of models learning shortcuts instead of true correlations, and the risk of automation bias in clinical decision-making, I believe this is an area where machine learning is already having a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s talk about some of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/news\"&gt;headlines coming out of the Schmidt Center&lt;/a&gt; recently. What current research do you think people should be particularly excited about, and why?&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;In collaboration with Dr. Fei Chen at the Broad Institute, we have recently developed a method for the prediction of unseen proteins’ subcellular location, called PUPS. Many existing methods can only make predictions based on the specific protein and cell data on which they were trained. PUPS, however, combines a protein language model with an image in-painting model to utilize both protein sequences and cellular images. We demonstrate that the protein sequence input enables generalization to unseen proteins, and the cellular image input captures single-cell variability, enabling cell-type-specific predictions. The model learns how relevant each amino acid residue is for the predicted sub-cellular localization, and it can predict changes in localization due to mutations in the protein sequences. Since proteins’ function is strictly related to their subcellular localization, our predictions could provide insights into potential mechanisms of disease. In the future, we aim to extend this method to predict the localization of multiple proteins in a cell and possibly understand protein-protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with Professor G.V. Shivashankar, a long-time collaborator at ETH Zürich, we have previously shown how simple images of cells stained with fluorescent DNA-intercalating dyes to label the chromatin can yield a lot of information about the state and fate of a cell in health and disease, when combined with machine learning algorithms. Recently, we have furthered this observation and proved the deep link between chromatin organization and gene regulation by developing Image2Reg, a method that enables the prediction of unseen genetically or chemically perturbed genes from chromatin images. Image2Reg utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn an informative representation of the chromatin images of perturbed cells. It also employs a graph convolutional network to create a gene embedding that captures the regulatory effects of genes based on protein-protein interaction data, integrated with cell-type-specific transcriptomic data. Finally, it learns a map between the resulting physical and biochemical representation of cells, allowing us to predict the perturbed gene modules based on chromatin images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we recently finalized the development of a method for predicting the outcomes of unseen combinatorial gene perturbations and identifying the types of interactions occurring between the perturbed genes. MORPH can guide the design of the most informative perturbations for lab-in-a-loop experiments. Furthermore, the attention-based framework provably enables our method to identify causal relations among the genes, providing insights into the underlying gene regulatory programs. Finally, thanks to its modular structure, we can apply MORPH to perturbation data measured in various modalities, including not only transcriptomics, but also imaging. We are very excited about the potential of this method to enable the efficient exploration of the perturbation space to advance our understanding of cellular programs by bridging causal theory to important applications, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-caroline-uhler.jpg?itok=-Tnd3ZSd\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“The current landscape of machine learning presents a unique opportunity to address problems across different levels of biological organization, from proteins to organisms, due to a data revolution in biology and significant advancements in AI,” says Caroline Uhler. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Jiin Kang</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/interview\">Interview</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health\">Health sciences and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/genomics\">Genomics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cells\">Cells</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/proteins\">Proteins</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dna\">DNA</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/crispr\">CRISPR</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT researchers develop AI tool to improve flu vaccine strain selection</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/vaxseer-ai-tool-to-improve-flu-vaccine-strain-selection-0828</link>\n  <description>VaxSeer uses machine learning to predict virus evolution and antigenicity, aiming to make vaccine selection more accurate and less reliant on guesswork.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:50:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/vaxseer-ai-tool-to-improve-flu-vaccine-strain-selection-0828</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2ef4ad7e-7fff-c28e-41c1-d61ce18592ae\"&gt;Every year, global health experts are faced with a high-stakes decision: Which influenza strains should go into the next seasonal vaccine? The choice must be made months in advance, long before flu season even begins, and it can often feel like a race against the clock. If the selected strains match those that circulate, the vaccine will likely be highly effective. But if the prediction is off, protection can drop significantly, leading to (potentially preventable) illness and strain on health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;This challenge became even more familiar to scientists in the years during the Covid-19 pandemic. Think back to the time (and time and time again), when new variants emerged just as vaccines were being rolled out. Influenza behaves like a similar, rowdy cousin, mutating constantly and unpredictably. That makes it hard to stay ahead, and therefore harder to design vaccines that remain protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To reduce this uncertainty, scientists at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health set out to make vaccine selection more accurate and less reliant on guesswork. They created an AI system called VaxSeer, designed to predict dominant flu strains and identify the most protective vaccine candidates, months ahead of time. The tool uses deep learning models trained on decades of viral sequences and lab test results to simulate how the flu virus might evolve and how the vaccines will respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Traditional evolution models often analyze the effect of single amino acid mutations independently. “VaxSeer adopts a large protein language model to learn the relationship between dominance and the combinatorial effects of mutations,” explains Wenxian Shi, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, researcher at CSAIL, and lead author of a new paper on the work. “Unlike existing protein language models that assume a static distribution of viral variants, we model dynamic dominance shifts, making it better suited for rapidly evolving viruses like influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;An &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03917-y\"&gt;open-access report on the study&lt;/a&gt; was published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;VaxSeer has two core prediction engines: one that estimates how likely each viral strain is to spread (dominance), and another that estimates how effectively a vaccine will neutralize that strain (antigenicity). Together, they produce a predicted coverage score: a forward-looking measure of how well a given vaccine is likely to perform against future viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The scale of the score could be from an infinite negative to 0. The closer the score to 0, the better the antigenic match of vaccine strains to the circulating viruses. (You can imagine it as the negative of some kind of “distance.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In a 10-year retrospective study, the researchers evaluated VaxSeer’s recommendations against those made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for two major flu subtypes: A/H3N2 and A/H1N1. For A/H3N2, VaxSeer’s choices outperformed the WHO’s in nine out of 10 seasons, based on retrospective empirical coverage scores (a surrogate metric of the vaccine effectiveness, calculated from the observed dominance from past seasons and experimental HI test results). The team used this to evaluate vaccine selections, as the effectiveness is only available for vaccines actually given to the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For A/H1N1, it outperformed or matched the WHO in six out of 10 seasons. In one notable case, for the 2016 flu season, VaxSeer identified a strain that wasn’t chosen by the WHO until the following year. The model’s predictions also showed strong correlation with real-world vaccine effectiveness estimates, as reported by the CDC, Canada’s Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network, and Europe’s I-MOVE program. VaxSeer’s predicted coverage scores aligned closely with public health data on flu-related illnesses and medical visits prevented by vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;So how exactly does VaxSeer make sense of all these data? Intuitively, the model first estimates how rapidly a viral strain spreads over time using a protein language model, and then determines its dominance by accounting for competition among different strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Once the model has calculated its insights, they’re plugged into a mathematical framework based on something called ordinary differential equations to simulate viral spread over time. For antigenicity, the system estimates how well a given vaccine strain will perform in a common lab test called the hemagglutination inhibition assay. This measures how effectively antibodies can&amp;nbsp;inhibit the virus from binding to human red blood cells, which is a widely used proxy for antigenic match/antigenicity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outpacing evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“By modeling how viruses evolve and how vaccines interact with them, AI tools like VaxSeer could help health officials make better, faster decisions — and stay one step ahead in the race between infection and immunity,” says Shi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;VaxSeer currently focuses only on the flu virus’s HA (hemagglutinin) protein,the major antigen of influenza. Future versions could incorporate other proteins like NA (neuraminidase), and factors like immune history, manufacturing constraints, or dosage levels. Applying the system to other viruses would also require large, high-quality datasets that track both viral evolution and immune responses — data that aren’t always publicly available. The team, however is currently working on the methods that can predict viral evolution in low-data regimes building on relations between viral families&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Given the speed of viral evolution, current therapeutic development often lags behind.&amp;nbsp;VaxSeer is our attempt to catch up,” says Regina Barzilay, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor for AI and Health at MIT, AI lead of Jameel Clinic, and CSAIL principal investigator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This paper is impressive, but what excites me perhaps even more is the team’s ongoing work on predicting viral evolution in low-data settings,” says Assistant Professor Jon Stokes of the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “The implications go far beyond influenza. Imagine being able to anticipate how antibiotic-resistant bacteria or drug-resistant cancers might evolve, both of which can adapt rapidly. This kind of predictive modeling opens up a powerful new way of thinking about how diseases change, giving us the opportunity to stay one step ahead and design clinical interventions before escape becomes a major problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Shi and Barzilay wrote the paper with MIT CSAIL postdoc Jeremy Wohlwend ’16, MEng ’17, PhD ’25 and recent CSAIL affiliate Menghua Wu ’19, MEng ’20, PhD ’25.

This could lead someone to believe a deep-learning model makes more accurate predictions when that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a more robust way of evaluating these techniques, which shows that, while simple models are more accurate when estimating regional surface temperatures, deep-learning approaches can be the best choice for estimating local rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used these results to enhance a simulation tool known as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bc3.mit.edu/demos/en-roads/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;climate emulator&lt;/a&gt;, which can rapidly simulate the effect of human activities onto a future climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers see their work as a “cautionary tale” about the risk of deploying large AI models for climate science. While deep-learning models have shown incredible success in domains such as natural language, climate science contains a proven set of physical laws and approximations, and the challenge becomes how to incorporate those into AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to develop models that are going to be useful and relevant for the kinds of things that decision-makers need going forward when making climate policy choices. While it might be attractive to use the latest, big-picture machine-learning model on a climate problem, what this study shows is that stepping back and really thinking about the problem fundamentals is important and useful,” says study senior author Noelle Selin, a professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), and director of the Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selin’s co-authors are lead author Björn Lütjens, a former EAPS postdoc who is now a research scientist at IBM Research; senior author Raffaele Ferrari, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Oceanography in EAPS and co-director of the Lorenz Center; and Duncan Watson-Parris, assistant professor at the University of California at San Diego. Selin and Ferrari are also co-principal investigators of the &lt;a href=\"https://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/flagship-projects/bringing-computation-to-the-climate-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge&lt;/a&gt; project, out of which this research emerged. The &lt;a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024MS004619\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; appears today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing emulators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Earth’s climate is so complex, running a state-of-the-art climate model to predict how pollution levels will impact environmental factors like temperature can take weeks on the world’s most powerful supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often create climate emulators, simpler approximations of a state-of-the art climate model, which are faster and more accessible. A policymaker could use a climate emulator to see how alternative assumptions on greenhouse gas emissions would affect future temperatures, helping them develop regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an emulator isn’t very useful if it makes inaccurate predictions about the local impacts of climate change. While deep learning has become increasingly popular for emulation, few studies have explored whether these models perform better than tried-and-true approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers performed such a study. They compared a traditional technique called linear pattern scaling (LPS) with a deep-learning model using a common benchmark dataset for evaluating climate emulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that LPS outperformed deep-learning models on predicting nearly all parameters they tested, including temperature and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Large AI methods are very appealing to scientists, but they rarely solve a completely new problem, so implementing an existing solution first is necessary to find out whether the complex machine-learning approach actually improves upon it,” says Lütjens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some initial results seemed to fly in the face of the researchers’ domain knowledge. The powerful deep-learning model should have been more accurate when making predictions about precipitation, since those data don’t follow a linear pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the high amount of natural variability in climate model runs can cause the deep learning model to perform poorly on unpredictable long-term oscillations, like El Niño/La Niña. This skews the benchmarking scores in favor of LPS, which averages out those oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructing a new evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the researchers constructed a new evaluation with more data that address natural climate variability. With this new evaluation, the deep-learning model performed slightly better than LPS for local precipitation, but LPS was still more accurate for temperature predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to use the modeling tool that is right for the problem, but in order to do that you also have to set up the problem the right way in the first place,” Selin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the researchers incorporated LPS into a climate emulation platform to predict local temperature changes in different emission scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not advocating that LPS should always be the goal. It still has limitations. For instance, LPS doesn’t predict variability or extreme weather events,”&amp;nbsp;Ferrari adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, they hope their results emphasize the need to develop better benchmarking techniques, which could provide a fuller picture of which climate emulation technique is best suited for a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With an improved climate emulation benchmark, we could use more complex machine-learning methods to explore problems that are currently very hard to address, like the impacts of aerosols or estimations of extreme precipitation,” Lütjens says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, more accurate benchmarking techniques will help ensure policymakers are making decisions based on the best available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope others build on their analysis, perhaps by studying additional improvements to climate emulation methods and benchmarks. Such research could explore impact-oriented metrics like drought indicators and wildfire risks, or new variables like regional wind speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by Schmidt Sciences, LLC, and is part of the MIT Climate Grand Challenges team for “Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Climate-Emulators-01-press.jpg?itok=EtBcQ0D-\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Simple climate prediction models can outperform deep-learning approaches when predicting future temperature changes, but deep learning has potential for estimating more complex variables like rainfall, according to an MIT study.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pollution\">Pollution</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/public-health\">Public health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/earth-atmosphere\">Earth and atmospheric sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/eaps\">EAPS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New technologies tackle brain health assessment for the military</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technologies-tackle-brain-health-assessment-for-military-0825</link>\n  <description>Tools build on years of research at Lincoln Laboratory to develop a rapid brain health screening capability and may also be applicable to civilian settings such as sporting events and medical offices.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technologies-tackle-brain-health-assessment-for-military-0825</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne McGovern | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive readiness denotes a person's ability to respond and adapt to the changes around them. This includes functions like keeping balance after tripping, or making the right decision in a challenging situation based on knowledge and past experiences. For military service members, cognitive readiness is crucial for their health and safety, as well as mission success. Injury to the brain is a major contributor to cognitive impairment, and between 2000 and 2024,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Centers-of-Excellence/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Center-of-Excellence/DOD-TBI-Worldwide-Numbers\"&gt;more than 500,000&lt;/a&gt; military service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) — caused by anything from a fall during training to blast exposure on the battlefield. While impairment from factors like sleep deprivation can be treated through rest and recovery, others caused by injury may require more intense and prolonged medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Current cognitive readiness tests administered to service members lack the sensitivity to detect subtle shifts in cognitive performance that may occur in individuals exposed to operational hazards,\" says Christopher Smalt, a researcher in the laboratory's &lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/human-health-and-performance-systems\"&gt;Human Health and Performance Systems Group.&lt;/a&gt; \"Unfortunately, the cumulative effects of these exposures are often not well-documented during military service or after transition to Veterans Affairs, making it challenging to provide effective support.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smalt is part of a team at the laboratory developing a suite of portable diagnostic tests that provide near-real-time screening for brain injury and cognitive health. One of these tools, called READY, is a smartphone or tablet app that helps identify a potential change in cognitive performance in less than 90 seconds. Another tool, called MINDSCAPE — which is being developed in collaboration with Richard Fletcher, a visiting scientist in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/rapid-prototyping\"&gt;Rapid Prototyping Group&lt;/a&gt; who leads the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://mobilehealthlab.com/\"&gt;Mobile Technology Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://autoid.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Auto-ID Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, and his students — uses virtual reality (VR) technology for a more in-depth analysis to pinpoint specific conditions such as TBI, post-traumatic stress disorder, or sleep deprivation. Using these tests, medical personnel on the battlefield can make quick and effective decisions for treatment triage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both READY and MINDSCAPE are a response to a series of Congressional legislation mandates, military program requirements, and mission-driven health needs to improve brain health screening capabilities for service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive readiness biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The READY and MINDSCAPE platforms incorporate more than a decade of laboratory research on finding the right indicators of cognitive readiness to build into rapid testing applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/biographies/thomas-f-quatieri\"&gt;Thomas Quatieri&lt;/a&gt; oversaw this work and identified balance, eye movement, and speech as three reliable biomarkers. He is leading the effort at Lincoln Laboratory to develop READY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"READY stands for Rapid Evaluation of Attention for DutY, and is built on the premise that attention is the key to being 'ready' for a mission,\" he says. \"In one view, we can think of attention as the mental state that allows you to focus on a task.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone to be attentive, their brain must continuously anticipate and process incoming sensory information and then instruct the body to respond appropriately. For example, if a friend yells \"catch\" and then throws a ball in your direction, in order to catch that ball, your brain must process the incoming auditory and visual data, predict in advance what may happen in the next few moments, and then direct your body to respond with an action that synchronizes those sensory data. The result? You realize from hearing the word \"catch\" and seeing the moving ball that your friend is throwing the ball to you, and you reach out a hand to catch it just in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"An unhealthy or fatigued brain — caused by TBI or sleep deprivation, for example — may have challenges within a neurosensory feed-forward [prediction] or feedback [error] system, thus hampering the person's ability to attend,\" Quatieri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READY's three tests measure a person’s ability to track a moving dot with their eye, balance, and hold a vowel fixed at one pitch. The app then uses the data to calculate a variability or \"wobble\" indicator, which represents changes from the test taker's baseline or from expected results based on others with similar demographics, or the general population. The results are displayed to the user as an indication of the patient's level of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the READY screen shows an impairment, the administrator can then direct the subject to follow up with MINDSCAPE, which stands for Mobile Interface for Neurological Diagnostic Situational Cognitive Assessment and Psychological Evaluation. MINDSCAPE uses VR technology to administer additional, in-depth tests to measure cognitive functions such as reaction time and working memory. These standard neurocognitive tests are recorded with multimodal physiological sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG), photoplethysmography, and pupillometry, to better pinpoint diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic and adaptable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key advantage of READY and MINDSCAPE is their ability to leverage existing technologies, allowing for rapid deployment in the field. By utilizing sensors and capabilities already integrated into smartphones, tablets, and VR devices, these assessment tools can be easily adapted for use in operational settings at a significantly reduced cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We can immediately apply our advanced algorithms to the data collected from these devices, without the need for costly and time-consuming hardware development,\" Smalt says. \"By harnessing the capabilities of commercially available technologies, we can quickly provide valuable insights and improve upon traditional assessment methods.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing new capabilities and AI for brain-health sensing into operational environments is a theme across several projects at the laboratory. Another example is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/fifteen-lincoln-laboratory-technologies-receive-rd-100-awards\"&gt;EYEBOOM&lt;/a&gt; (Electrooculography and Balance Blast Overpressure Monitoring System), a wearable technology developed for the U.S. Special Forces to monitor blast exposure. EYEBOOM continuously monitors a wearer's eye and body movements as they experience blast energy, and warns of potential harm. For this program, the laboratory developed an algorithm that could identify a potential change in physiology resulting from blast exposure during operations, rather than waiting for a check-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three technologies are in development to be versatile, so they can be adapted for other relevant uses. For example, a workflow could pair EYEBOOM's monitoring capabilities with the READY and MINDSCAPE tests: EYEBOOM would continuously monitor for exposure risk and then prompt the wearer to seek additional assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of times, research focuses on one specific modality, whereas what we do at the laboratory is search for a holistic solution that can be applied for many different purposes,\" Smalt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINDSCAPE is undergoing testing at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://walterreed.tricare.mil/\"&gt;Walter Reed National Military Center&lt;/a&gt; this year. READY will be tested with the&amp;nbsp;U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) in 2026 in the context of sleep deprivation. Smalt and Quatieri also see the technologies finding use in civilian settings — on sporting event sidelines, in doctors' offices, or wherever else there is a need to assess brain readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINDSCAPE is being developed with clinical validation and support from Stefanie Kuchinsky at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Quatieri and his team are developing the READY tests in collaboration with Jun Maruta and Jam Ghajar from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://braintrauma.org/\"&gt;Brain Trauma Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (BTF), and Kristin Heaton from USARIEM. The tests are supported by concurrent evidence-based guidelines lead by the BTF and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://mtbi2.usuhs.edu/\"&gt;Military TBI Initiative&lt;/a&gt; at Uniform Services University.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-lincoln-Brain-Health-Military.jpg?itok=gtPYkumz\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Lincoln Laboratory researchers are building rapid brain health screening capabilities for military service members.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Tammy Ko/Lincoln Laboratory</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/brain-cognitive\">Brain and cognitive sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/neuroscience\">Neuroscience</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/diagnostic-devices\">Diagnostic devices</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biomedical-sensors\">Biomedical sensors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/augmented-and-virtual-reality\">Augmented and virtual reality</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/security-studies\">Security studies and military</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mobile-applications\">Mobile applications</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health-care\">Health care</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sports\">Sports and fitness</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lincoln-laboratory-0\">Lincoln Laboratory</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Can large language models figure out the real world?</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-large-language-models-figure-out-real-world-0825</link>\n  <description>New test could help determine if AI systems that make accurate predictions in one area can understand it well enough to apply that ability to a different area.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-large-language-models-figure-out-real-world-0825</guid>\n        <dc:creator>David Chandler | Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in the 17th century, German astronomer Johannes Kepler figured out the laws of motion that made it possible to accurately predict where our solar system’s planets would appear in the sky as they orbit the sun. But it wasn’t until decades later, when Isaac Newton formulated the universal laws of gravitation, that the underlying principles were understood. Although they were inspired by Kepler’s laws, they went much further, and made it possible to apply the same formulas to everything from the trajectory of a cannon ball to the way the moon’s pull controls the tides on Earth — or how to launch a satellite from Earth to the surface of the moon or planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s sophisticated artificial intelligence systems have gotten very good at making the kind of specific predictions that resemble Kepler’s orbit predictions. But do they know why these predictions work, with the kind of deep understanding that comes from basic principles like Newton’s laws? As the world grows ever-more dependent on these kinds of AI systems, researchers are struggling to try to measure just how they do what they do, and how deep their understanding of the real world actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and at Harvard University have devised a new approach to assessing how deeply these predictive systems understand their subject matter, and whether they can apply knowledge from one domain to a slightly different one. And by and large the answer at this point, in the examples they studied, is — not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/44374\"&gt;findings were presented&lt;/a&gt; at the International Conference on Machine Learning, in Vancouver, British Columbia, last month by Harvard postdoc Keyon Vafa, MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and LIDS affiliate Peter G. Chang, MIT assistant professor and LIDS principal investigator Ashesh Rambachan, and MIT professor, LIDS principal investigator, and senior author Sendhil Mullainathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans all the time have been able to make this transition from good predictions to world models,” says Vafa, the study’s lead author. So the question their team was addressing was, “have foundation models — has AI — been able to make that leap from predictions to world models? And we’re not asking are they capable, or can they, or will they. It’s just, have they done it so far?” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know how to test whether an algorithm predicts well. But what we need is a way to test for whether it has understood well,” says Mullainathan, the Peter de Florez Professor with dual appointments in the MIT departments of Economics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the senior author on the study. “Even defining what understanding means was a challenge.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Kepler versus Newton analogy, Vafa says, “they both had models that worked really well on one task, and that worked essentially the same way on that task. What Newton offered was ideas that were able to generalize to new tasks.” That capability, when applied to the predictions made by various AI systems, would entail having it develop a world model so it can “transcend the task that you’re working on and be able to generalize to new kinds of problems and paradigms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another analogy that helps to illustrate the point is the difference between centuries of accumulated knowledge of how to selectively breed crops and animals, versus Gregor Mendel’s insight into the underlying laws of genetic inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of excitement in the field about using foundation models to not just perform tasks, but to learn something about the world,” for example in the natural sciences, he says. “It would need to adapt, have a world model to adapt to any possible task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are AI systems anywhere near the ability to reach such generalizations? To test the question, the team looked at different examples of predictive AI systems, at different levels of complexity. On the very simplest of examples, the systems succeeded in creating a realistic model of the simulated system, but as the examples got more complex that ability faded fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a new metric, a way of measuring quantitatively how well a system approximates real-world conditions. They call the measurement inductive bias — that is, a tendency or bias toward responses that reflect reality, based on inferences developed from looking at vast amounts of data on specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest level of examples they looked at was known as a lattice model. In a one-dimensional lattice, something can move only along a line. Vafa compares it to a frog jumping between lily pads in a row. As the frog jumps or sits, it calls out what it’s doing — right, left, or stay. If it reaches the last lily pad in the row, it can only stay or go back. If someone, or an AI system, can just hear the calls, without knowing anything about the number of lily pads, can it figure out the configuration? The answer is yes: Predictive models do well at reconstructing the “world” in such a simple case. But even with lattices, as you increase the number of dimensions, the systems no longer can make that leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in a two-state or three-state lattice, we showed that the model does have a pretty good inductive bias toward the actual state,” says Chang. “But as we increase the number of states, then it starts to have a divergence from real-world models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complex problem is a system that can play the board game Othello, which involves players alternately placing black or white disks on a grid. The AI models can accurately predict what moves are allowable at a given point, but it turns out they do badly at inferring what the overall arrangement of pieces on the board is, including ones that are currently blocked from play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then looked at five different categories of predictive models actually in use, and again, the more complex the systems involved, the more poorly the predictive modes performed at matching the true underlying world model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new metric of inductive bias, “our hope is to provide a kind of test bed where you can evaluate different models, different training approaches, on problems where we know what the true world model is,” Vafa says. If it performs well on these cases where we already know the underlying reality, then we can have greater faith that its predictions may be useful even in cases “where we don’t really know what the truth is,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are already trying to use these kinds of predictive AI systems to aid in scientific discovery, including such things as properties of chemical compounds that have never actually been created, or of potential pharmaceutical compounds, or for predicting the folding behavior and properties of unknown protein molecules. “For the more realistic problems,” Vafa says, “even for something like basic mechanics, we found that there seems to be a long way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang says, “There’s been a lot of hype around foundation models, where people are trying to build domain-specific foundation models — biology-based foundation models, physics-based foundation models, robotics foundation models, foundation models for other types of domains where people have been collecting a ton of data” and training these models to make predictions, “and then hoping that it acquires some knowledge of the domain itself, to be used for other downstream tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work shows there’s a long way to go, but it also helps to show a path forward. “Our paper suggests that we can apply our metrics to evaluate how much the representation is learning, so that we can come up with better ways of training foundation models, or at least evaluate the models that we’re training currently,” Chang says. “As an engineering field, once we have a metric for something, people are really, really good at optimizing that metric.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/Foundation-models.jpg?itok=IXXXhTI8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers at MIT and Harvard University have devised a new approach to assessing how deeply predictive AI systems understand their subject matter, and whether they can apply knowledge from one domain to a slightly different one. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/economics\">Economics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A new model predicts how molecules will dissolve in different solvents</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819</link>\n  <description>Solubility predictions could make it easier to design and synthesize new drugs, while minimizing the use of more hazardous solvents.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, MIT chemical engineers have created a computational model that can predict how well any given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent — a key step in the synthesis of nearly any pharmaceutical. This type of prediction could make it much easier to develop new ways to produce drugs and other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which predicts how much of a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent, should help chemists to choose the right solvent for any given reaction in their synthesis, the researchers say. Common organic solvents include ethanol and acetone, and there are hundreds of others that can also be used in chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Predicting solubility really is a rate-limiting step in synthetic planning and manufacturing of chemicals, especially drugs, so there’s been a longstanding interest in being able to make better predictions of solubility,” says Lucas Attia, an MIT graduate student and one of the lead authors of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://askcos.mit.edu/solprop?tab=solpred\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; freely available, and many companies and labs have already started using it. The model could be particularly useful for identifying solvents that are less hazardous than some of the most commonly used industrial solvents, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some solvents which are known to dissolve most things. They’re really useful, but they’re damaging to the environment, and they’re damaging to people, so many companies require that you have to minimize the amount of those solvents that you use,” says Jackson Burns, an MIT graduate student who is also a lead author of the paper. “Our model is extremely useful in being able to identify the next-best solvent, which is hopefully much less damaging to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Green, the Hoyt Hottel Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the MIT Energy Initiative, is the senior author of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62717-7\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering, is also an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving solubility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model grew out of a project that Attia and Burns worked on together in an MIT course&amp;nbsp;on applying machine learning to chemical engineering problems. Traditionally, chemists have predicted solubility with a tool known as the Abraham Solvation Model, which can be used to estimate a molecule’s overall solubility by adding up the contributions of chemical structures within the molecule. While these predictions are useful, their accuracy is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, researchers have begun using machine learning to try to make more accurate solubility predictions. Before Burns and Attia began working on their new model, the state-of-the-art model for predicting solubility was a model developed in Green’s lab in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model, known as SolProp, works by predicting a set of related properties and combining them, using thermodynamics, to ultimately predict the solubility. However, the model has difficulty predicting solubility for solutes that it hasn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For drug and chemical discovery pipelines where you’re developing a new molecule, you want to be able to predict ahead of time what its solubility looks like,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that existing solubility models haven’t worked well is because there wasn’t a comprehensive dataset to train them on. However, in 2023 a new dataset called BigSolDB was released, which compiled data from nearly 800 published papers, including information on solubility for about 800 molecules dissolved about more than 100 organic solvents that are commonly used in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia and Burns decided to try training two different types of models on this data. Both of these models represent the chemical structures of molecules using numerical representations known as embeddings, which incorporate information such as the number of atoms in a molecule and which atoms are bound to which other atoms. Models can then use these representations to predict a variety of chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the models used in this study, known as FastProp and developed by Burns and others in Green’s lab, incorporates “static embeddings.” This means that the model already knows the embedding for each molecule before it starts doing any kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other model, ChemProp, learns an embedding for each molecule during the training, at the same time that it learns to associate the features of the embedding with a trait such as solubility. This model, developed across multiple MIT labs, has already been used for tasks such as antibiotic discovery, lipid nanoparticle design, and predicting chemical reaction rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained both types of models on over 40,000 data points from BigSolDB, including information on the effects of temperature, which plays a significant role in solubility. Then, they tested the models on about 1,000 solutes that had been withheld from the training data. They found that the models’ predictions were two to three times more accurate than those of SolProp, the previous best model, and the new models were especially accurate at predicting variations in solubility due to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to accurately reproduce those small variations in solubility due to temperature, even when the overarching experimental noise is very large, was a really positive sign that the network had correctly learned an underlying solubility prediction function,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had expected that the model based on ChemProp, which is able to learn new representations as it goes along, would be able to make more accurate predictions. However, to their surprise, they found that the two models performed essentially the same. That suggests that the main limitation on their performance is the quality of the data, and that the models are performing as well as theoretically possible based on the data that they’re using, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChemProp should always outperform any static embedding when you have sufficient data,” Burns says. “We were blown away to see that the static and learned embeddings were statistically indistinguishable in performance across all the different subsets, which indicates to us that that the data limitations that are present in this space dominated the model performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models could become more accurate, the researchers say, if better training and testing data were available — ideally, data obtained by one person or a group of people all trained to perform the experiments the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big limitations of using these kinds of compiled datasets is that different labs use different methods and experimental conditions when they perform solubility tests. That contributes to this variability between different datasets,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model based on FastProp makes its predictions faster and has code that is easier for other users to adapt, the researchers decided to make that one, known as FastSolv, available to the public. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have already begun using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are applications throughout the drug discovery pipeline,” Burns says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re also excited to see, outside of formulation and drug discovery, where people may use this model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Predict-Solubility-01-press.jpg?itok=NlJyl9z7\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT chemical engineers created a computational model that can predict how well a given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the researchers; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-development\">Drug development</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pharmaceuticals\">Pharmaceuticals</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemistry-0\">Chemistry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cleaner-industry\">Cleaner industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Researchers glimpse the inner workings of protein language models</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-glimpse-inner-workings-protein-language-models-0818</link>\n  <description>A new approach can reveal the features AI models use to predict proteins that might make good drug or vaccine targets.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-glimpse-inner-workings-protein-language-models-0818</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Within the past few years, models that can predict the structure or function of proteins have been widely used for a variety of biological applications, such as identifying drug targets and designing new therapeutic antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models, which are based on large language models (LLMs), can make very accurate predictions of a protein’s suitability for a given application. However, there’s no way to determine how these models make their predictions or which protein features play the most important role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, MIT researchers have used a novel technique to open up that “black box” and allow them to determine what features a protein language model takes into account when making predictions. Understanding what is happening inside that black box&amp;nbsp;could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work has broad implications for enhanced explainability in downstream tasks that rely on these representations,” says Bonnie Berger, the Simons Professor of Mathematics, head of the Computation and Biology group in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the senior author of the study. “Additionally, identifying features that protein language models track has the potential to reveal novel biological insights from these representations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onkar Gujral, an MIT graduate student, is the lead author of the open-access &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2506316122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/em&gt; Mihir Bafna, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, and Eric Alm, an MIT professor of biological engineering, are also authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening the black box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Berger and former MIT graduate student Tristan Bepler PhD ’20 &lt;a href=\"https://openreview.net/revisions?id=SygLehCqtm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; the first protein language model. Their model, like subsequent protein models that accelerated the development of&amp;nbsp;AlphaFold, such as&amp;nbsp;ESM2 and OmegaFold, was based on LLMs. These models, which include ChatGPT, can analyze huge amounts of text and figure out which words are most likely to appear together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein language models use a similar approach, but instead of analyzing words, they analyze amino acid sequences. Researchers have used these models to predict the structure and function of proteins, and for applications such as identifying proteins that might bind to particular drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/model-viruses-escape-immune-0114\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, Berger and colleagues used a protein language model to predict which sections of viral surface proteins are less likely to mutate in a way that enables viral escape. This allowed them to identify possible targets for vaccines against influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in all of these studies, it has been impossible to know how the models were making their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would get out some prediction at the end, but we had absolutely no idea what was happening in the individual components of this black box,” Berger says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers wanted to dig into how protein language models make their predictions. Just like LLMs, protein language models encode information as representations that consist of a pattern of activation of different “nodes” within a neural network. These nodes are analogous to the networks of neurons that store memories and other information within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inner workings of LLMs are not easy to interpret, but within the past couple of years, researchers have begun using a type of algorithm known as a sparse autoencoder to help shed some light on how those models make their predictions. The new study from Berger’s lab is the first to use this algorithm on protein language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparse autoencoders work by adjusting how a protein is represented within a neural network. Typically, a given protein will be represented by a pattern of activation of a constrained number of neurons, for example, 480. A sparse autoencoder will expand that representation into a much larger number of nodes, say 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When information about a protein is encoded by only 480 neurons, each node lights up for multiple features, making it very difficult to know what features each node is encoding. However, when the neural network is expanded to 20,000 nodes, this extra space along with a sparsity constraint gives the information room to “spread out.” Now, a feature of the protein that was previously encoded by multiple nodes can occupy a single node.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sparse representation, the neurons lighting up are doing so in a more meaningful manner,” Gujral says. “Before the sparse representations are created, the networks pack information so tightly together that it's hard to interpret the neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpretable models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers obtained sparse representations of many proteins, they used an AI assistant called Claude (related to the popular Anthropic chatbot of the same name), to analyze the representations. In this case, they asked Claude to compare the sparse representations with the known features of each protein, such as molecular function, protein family, or location within a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing thousands of representations, Claude can determine which nodes correspond to specific protein features, then describe them in plain English. For example, the algorithm might say, “This neuron appears to be detecting proteins involved in transmembrane transport of ions or amino acids, particularly those located in the plasma membrane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process makes the nodes far more “interpretable,” meaning the researchers can tell what each node is encoding. They found that the features most likely to be encoded by these nodes were protein family and certain functions, including several different metabolic and biosynthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you train a sparse autoencoder, you aren’t training it to be interpretable, but it turns out that by incentivizing the representation to be really sparse, that ends up resulting in interpretability,” Gujral says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what features a particular protein model is encoding could help researchers choose the right model for a particular task, or tweak the type of input they give the model, to generate the best results. Additionally, analyzing the features that a model encodes could one day help biologists to learn more about the proteins that they are studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point when the models get a lot more powerful, you could learn more biology than you already know, from opening up the models,” Gujral says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-model-interpret-01-press.jpg?itok=nA-s3rBF\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Understanding what is happening inside the “black box” of large protein models could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/proteins\">Proteins</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-discovery\">Drug discovery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>How AI could speed the development of RNA vaccines and other RNA therapies</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-ai-could-speed-development-rna-vaccines-and-other-rna-therapies-0815</link>\n  <description>MIT engineers used a machine-learning model to design nanoparticles that can deliver RNA to cells more efficiently.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-ai-could-speed-development-rna-vaccines-and-other-rna-therapies-0815</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have come up with a new way to design nanoparticles that can more efficiently deliver RNA vaccines and other types of RNA therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training a machine-learning model to analyze thousands of existing delivery particles, the researchers used it to predict new materials that would work even better. The model also enabled the researchers to identify particles that would work well in different types of cells, and to discover ways to incorporate new types of materials into the particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we did was apply machine-learning tools to help accelerate the identification of optimal ingredient mixtures in lipid nanoparticles to help target a different cell type or help incorporate different materials, much faster than previously was possible,” says Giovanni Traverso,&amp;nbsp;an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital,&amp;nbsp;and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could dramatically speed the process of developing new RNA vaccines, as well as therapies that could be used to treat obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvin Chan, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University, and Ameya Kirtane, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, are the lead authors of the new open-access study, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01975-4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particle predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA vaccines, such as the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, are usually packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for delivery. These particles protect mRNA from being broken down in the body and help it to enter cells once injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating particles that handle these jobs more efficiently could help researchers to develop even more effective vaccines. Better delivery vehicles could also make it easier to develop mRNA therapies that encode genes for proteins that could help to treat a variety of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Traverso’s lab launched a multiyear&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-led-team-receives-funding-new-treatments-metabolic-disease-0205\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;research program&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), to develop new ingestible devices that could achieve oral delivery of RNA treatments and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of what we’re trying to do is develop ways of producing more protein, for example, for therapeutic applications. Maximizing the efficiency is important to be able to boost how much we can have the cells produce,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical LNP consists of four components — a cholesterol, a helper lipid, an ionizable lipid, and a lipid that is attached to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Different variants of each of these components can be swapped in to create a huge number of possible combinations. Changing up these formulations and testing each one individually is very time-consuming, so Traverso, Chan, and their colleagues decided to turn to artificial intelligence to help speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most AI models in drug discovery focus on optimizing a single compound at a time, but that approach doesn’t work for lipid nanoparticles, which are made of multiple interacting components,” Chan says. “To tackle this, we developed a new model called COMET, inspired by the same transformer architecture that powers large language models like ChatGPT. Just as those models understand how words combine to form meaning, COMET learns how different chemical components come together in a nanoparticle to influence its properties — like how well it can deliver RNA into cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate training data for their machine-learning model, the researchers created a library of about 3,000 different LNP formulations. The team tested each of these 3,000 particles in the lab to see how efficiently they could deliver their payload to cells, then fed all of this data into a machine-learning model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the model was trained, the researchers asked it to predict new formulations that would work better than existing LNPs. They tested those predictions by using the new formulations to deliver mRNA encoding a fluorescent protein to mouse skin cells grown in a lab dish. They found that the LNPs predicted by the model did indeed work better than the particles in the training data, and in some cases better than LNP formulations that are used commercially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerated development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers showed that the model could accurately predict particles that would efficiently deliver mRNA, they began asking additional questions. First, they wondered if they could train the model on nanoparticles that incorporate a fifth component: a type of polymer known as branched poly beta amino esters (PBAEs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by Traverso and his colleagues has shown that these polymers can effectively deliver nucleic acids on their own, so they wanted to explore whether adding them to LNPs could improve LNP performance. The MIT team created a set of about 300 LNPs that also include these polymers, which they used to train the model. The resulting model could then predict additional formulations with PBAEs that would work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers set out to train the model to make predictions about LNPs that would work best in different types of cells, including a type of cell called Caco-2, which is derived from colorectal cancer cells. Again, the model was able to predict LNPs that would efficiently deliver mRNA to these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the researchers used the model to predict which LNPs could best withstand lyophilization — a freeze-drying process often used to extend the shelf-life of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a tool that allows us to adapt it to a whole different set of questions and help accelerate development. We did a large training set that went into the model, but then you can do much more focused experiments and get outputs that are helpful on very different kinds of questions,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues are now working on incorporating some of these particles into potential treatments for diabetes and obesity, which are two of the primary targets of the ARPA-H funded project. Therapeutics that could be delivered using this approach include GLP-1 mimics with similar effects to Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by the GO Nano Marble Center at the Koch Institute, the Karl van Tassel Career Development Professorship, the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and ARPA-H.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-AI-Nanoparticles-01-press.jpg?itok=s93vqVvn\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“What we did was apply machine-learning tools to help accelerate the identification of optimal ingredient mixtures in lipid nanoparticles to help target a different cell type or help incorporate different materials, much faster than previously was possible,” says Giovanni Traverso.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the researchers; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/rna\">RNA</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/vaccines\">Vaccines</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-delivery\">Drug delivery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-discovery\">Drug discovery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Using generative AI, researchers design compounds that can kill drug-resistant bacteria</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/using-generative-ai-researchers-design-compounds-kill-drug-resistant-bacteria-0814</link>\n  <description>The team used two different AI approaches to design novel antibiotics, including one that showed promise against MRSA.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/using-generative-ai-researchers-design-compounds-kill-drug-resistant-bacteria-0814</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have designed novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; and multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(MRSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI algorithms, the research team designed more than 36 million possible compounds and computationally screened them for antimicrobial properties. The top candidates they discovered are structurally distinct from any existing antibiotics, and they appear to work by novel mechanisms that disrupt bacterial cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed the researchers to generate and evaluate theoretical compounds that have never been seen before — a strategy that they now hope to apply to identify and design compounds with activity against other species of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the new possibilities that this project opens up for antibiotics development. Our work shows the power of AI from a drug design standpoint, and enables us to exploit much larger chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible,” says James Collins,&amp;nbsp;the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering, and a member of the Broad Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00855-4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are MIT postdoc Aarti Krishnan, former postdoc Melis Anahtar ’08, and Jacqueline Valeri PhD ’23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring chemical space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 45 years, a few dozen&amp;nbsp;new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, but most of these are variants of existing antibiotics. At the same time, bacterial resistance to many of these drugs has been growing. Globally, it is estimated that drug-resistant bacterial infections cause nearly 5 million deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of finding new antibiotics to fight this growing problem, Collins and others at MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/collins-lab\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Antibiotics-AI Project&lt;/a&gt; have harnessed the power of AI to screen huge libraries of existing chemical compounds. This work has yielded several promising drug candidates, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;halicin&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/using-ai-scientists-combat-drug-resistant-infections-0525\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;abaucin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on that progress, Collins and his colleagues decided to expand their search into molecules that can’t be found in any chemical libraries. By using AI to generate hypothetically possible molecules that don’t exist or haven’t been discovered, they realized that it should be possible to explore a much greater diversity of potential drug compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers employed two different approaches: First, they directed generative AI algorithms to design molecules based on a specific chemical fragment that showed antimicrobial activity, and second, they let the algorithms freely generate molecules, without having to include a specific fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fragment-based approach, the researchers sought to identify molecules that could kill &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhea. They began by assembling a library of about 45 million known chemical fragments, consisting of all possible combinations of 11 atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur, along with fragments from Enamine’s REadily AccessibLe (REAL) space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they screened the library using machine-learning models that Collins’ lab has previously trained to predict antibacterial activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This resulted in nearly 4 million fragments. They narrowed down that pool by removing any fragments predicted to be cytotoxic to human cells, displayed chemical liabilities, and were known to be similar to existing antibiotics. This left them with about 1 million candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get rid of anything that would look like an existing antibiotic, to help address the antimicrobial resistance crisis in a fundamentally different way. By venturing into underexplored areas of chemical space, our goal was to uncover novel mechanisms of action,” Krishnan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through several rounds of additional experiments and computational analysis, the researchers identified a fragment they called F1 that appeared to have promising activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. They used this fragment as the basis for generating additional compounds, using two different generative AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those algorithms, known as chemically reasonable mutations (CReM), works by starting with a particular molecule containing F1 and then generating new molecules by adding, replacing, or deleting atoms and chemical groups. The second algorithm, F-VAE (fragment-based variational autoencoder), takes a chemical fragment and builds it into a complete molecule. It does so by learning patterns of how fragments are commonly modified, based on its pretraining on more than 1 million molecules from the ChEMBL database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two algorithms generated about 7 million candidates containing F1, which the researchers then computationally screened for activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This screen yielded about 1,000 compounds, and the researchers selected 80 of those to see if they could be produced by chemical synthesis vendors. Only two of these could be synthesized, and one of them, named NG1, was very effective at killing &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; in a lab dish and in a mouse model of drug-resistant gonorrhea infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional experiments revealed that NG1 interacts with a protein called LptA, a novel drug target involved in the synthesis of the bacterial outer membrane. It appears that the drug works by interfering with membrane synthesis, which is fatal to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconstrained design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second round of studies, the researchers explored the potential of using generative AI to freely design molecules, using Gram-positive bacteria, &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; as their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the researchers used CReM and VAE to generate molecules, but this time with no constraints other than the general rules of how atoms can join to form chemically plausible molecules. Together, the models generated more than 29 million compounds. The researchers then applied the same filters that they did to the &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; candidates, but focusing on &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;, eventually narrowing the pool down to about 90 compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were able to synthesize and test 22 of these molecules, and six of them showed strong antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;grown in a lab dish. They also found that the top candidate, named DN1, was able to clear a methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) skin infection in a mouse model. These molecules also appear to interfere with bacterial cell membranes, but with broader effects not limited to interaction with one specific protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phare Bio, a nonprofit that is also part of the Antibiotics-AI Project, is now working on further modifying NG1 and DN1 to make them suitable for additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a collaboration with Phare Bio, we are exploring analogs, as well as working on advancing the best candidates preclinically, through medicinal chemistry work,” Collins says. “We are also excited about applying the platforms that Aarti and the team have developed toward other bacterial pathogens of interest, notably &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense&amp;nbsp;Threat Reduction Agency, the&amp;nbsp;National Institutes of Health,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Audacious Project, Flu Lab, the Sea Grape Foundation, Rosamund Zander and Hansjorg Wyss for the Wyss Foundation, and an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Novel-Antibiotics-01.jpg?itok=hrC95Mtj\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have discovered novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: a drug-resistant form of gonorrhea and multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock, MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-resistance\">Drug resistance</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/microbes\">Microbes</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/disease\">Disease</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/bacteria\">Bacteria</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/antibiotics\">Antibiotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-development\">Drug development</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/institute-medical-engineering-and-science-imes-0\">Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A new way to test how well AI systems classify text</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-way-test-how-well-ai-systems-classify-text-0813</link>\n  <description>As large language models increasingly dominate our everyday lives, new systems for checking their reliability are more important than ever.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-way-test-how-well-ai-systems-classify-text-0813</guid>\n        <dc:creator>David Chandler | MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Is this movie review a rave or a pan? Is this news story about business or technology? Is this online chatbot conversation veering off into giving financial advice? Is this online medical information site giving out misinformation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of automated conversations, whether they involve seeking a movie or restaurant review or getting information about your bank account or health records, are becoming increasingly prevalent. More than ever, such evaluations are being made by highly sophisticated algorithms, known as text classifiers, rather than by human beings. But how can we tell how accurate these classifications really are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) has come up with an innovative approach to not only measure how well these classifiers are doing their job, but then go one step further and show how to make them more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new evaluation and remediation software was led and developed by Lei Xu alongside the research conducted by Sarah Alnegheimish, Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a principal research scientist at LIDS and senior author, with two others. The software package is being made freely available for download by anyone who wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standard method for testing these classification systems is to create what are known as&amp;nbsp;synthetic examples — sentences that closely resemble ones that have already been classified. For example, researchers might take a sentence that has already been tagged by a classifier program as being a rave review, and see if changing a word or a few words while retaining the same meaning could fool the classifier into deeming it a pan. Or a sentence that was determined to be misinformation might get misclassified as accurate. This ability to fool the classifiers makes these adversarial examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have tried various ways to find the vulnerabilities in these classifiers, Veeramachaneni says. But existing methods of finding these vulnerabilities have a hard time with this task and miss many examples that they should catch, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, companies are trying to use such evaluation tools in real time, monitoring the output of chatbots used for various purposes to try to make sure they are not putting out improper responses. For example, a bank might use a chatbot to respond to routine customer queries such as checking account balances or applying for a credit card, but it wants to ensure that its responses could never be interpreted as financial advice, which could expose the company to liability. “Before showing the chatbot’s response to the end user, they want to use the text classifier to detect whether it’s giving financial advice or not,” Veeramachaneni says. But then it’s important to test that classifier to see how reliable its evaluations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These chatbots, or summarization engines or whatnot are being set up across the board,” he says, to deal with external customers and within an organization as well, for example providing information about HR issues. It’s important to put these text classifiers into the loop to detect things that they are not supposed to say, and filter those out before the output gets transmitted to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where the use of adversarial examples comes in — those sentences that have already been classified but then produce a different response when they are slightly modified while retaining the same meaning. How can people confirm that the meaning is the same? By using another large language model (LLM) that interprets and compares meanings. So, if the LLM says the two sentences mean the same thing, but the classifier labels them differently, “that is a sentence that is adversarial — it can fool the classifier,” Veeramachaneni says. And when the researchers examined these adversarial sentences, “we found that most of the time, this was just a one-word change,” although the people using LLMs to generate these alternate sentences often didn’t realize that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation, using LLMs to analyze many thousands of examples, showed that certain specific words had an outsized influence in changing the classifications, and therefore the testing of a classifier’s accuracy could focus on this small subset of words that seem to make the most difference. They found that one-tenth of 1 percent of all the 30,000 words in the system’s vocabulary could account for almost half of all these reversals of classification, in some specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lei Xu PhD ’23, a recent graduate from LIDS who performed much of the analysis as part of his thesis work, “used a lot of interesting estimation techniques to figure out what are the most powerful words that can change the overall classification, that can fool the classifier,” Veeramachaneni says. The goal is to make it possible to do much more narrowly targeted searches, rather than combing through all possible word substitutions, thus making the computational task of generating adversarial examples much more manageable. “He’s using large language models, interestingly enough, as a way to understand the power of a single word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, also using LLMs, he&amp;nbsp;searches for other words that are closely related to these powerful words, and so on, allowing for an overall ranking of words according to their influence on the outcomes. Once these adversarial sentences have been found, they can be used in turn to retrain the classifier to take them into account, increasing the robustness of the classifier against those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making classifiers more accurate may not sound like a big deal if it’s just a matter of classifying news articles into categories, or deciding whether reviews of anything from movies to restaurants are positive or negative. But increasingly, classifiers are being used in settings where the outcomes really do matter, whether preventing the inadvertent release of sensitive medical, financial, or security information, or helping to guide important research, such as into properties of chemical compounds or the folding of proteins for biomedical applications, or in identifying and blocking hate speech or known misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this research, the team introduced a new metric, which they call p, which provides a measure of how robust a given classifier is against single-word attacks. And because of the importance of such misclassifications, the research team has made its products available as open access for anyone to use. The package consists of two components: SP-Attack, which generates adversarial sentences to test classifiers in any particular application, and SP-Defense, which aims to improve the robustness of the classifier by generating and using adversarial sentences to retrain the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some tests, where competing methods of testing classifier outputs allowed a 66 percent success rate by adversarial attacks, this team’s system cut that attack success rate almost in half, to 33.7 percent. In other applications, the improvement was as little as a 2 percent difference, but even that can be quite important, Veeramachaneni says, since these systems are being used for so many billions of interactions that even a small percentage can affect millions of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s results were published on July 7 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Expert Systems&lt;/em&gt; in a paper by Xu, Veeramachaneni, and Alnegheimish of LIDS, along with Laure Berti-Equille at IRD in Marseille, France, and Alfredo Cuesta-Infante at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, in Spain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-lids-text-classifier.jpg?itok=EFDHW0eB\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new approach measures how well text classifiers are doing their job, and shows how to make them more accurate.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-access\">Open access</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT gears up to transform manufacturing</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-gears-transform-manufacturing-0813</link>\n  <description>The Initiative for New Manufacturing is convening experts across the Institute to drive a transformation of production across the U.S. and the world.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-gears-transform-manufacturing-0813</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Eric Bender | MIT Industrial Liaison Program</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturing is the engine of society, and it is the backbone of robust, resilient economies,” says John Hart, head of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) and faculty co-director of the MIT &lt;a href=\"http://inm.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Initiative for New Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; (INM). “With manufacturing a lively topic in today’s news, there’s a renewed appreciation and understanding of the importance of manufacturing to innovation, to economic and national security, and to daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched this May, INM will “help create a transformation of manufacturing through new technology, through development of talent, and through an understanding of how to scale manufacturing in a way that enables imparts higher productivity and resilience, drives adoption of new technologies, and creates good jobs,” Hart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM is one of MIT’s strategic initiatives and builds on the successful three-year-old Manufacturing@MIT program. “It’s a recognition by MIT that manufacturing is an Institute-wide theme and an Institute-wide priority, and that manufacturing connects faculty and students across campus,” says Hart. Alongside Hart, INM’s faculty co-directors are Institute Professor Suzanne Berger and Chris Love, professor of chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is pursuing four main themes: reimagining manufacturing technologies and systems, elevating the productivity and human experience of manufacturing, scaling up new manufacturing, and transforming the manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking manufacturing barriers for corporations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen, Autodesk, Flex, GE Vernova, PTC, Sanofi, and Siemens are founding members of INM’s industry consortium. These industry partners will work closely with MIT faculty, researchers,&amp;nbsp;and students across many aspects of manufacturing-related research, both in broad-scale initiatives and in particular areas of shared interests. Membership requires a minimum three-year commitment of $500,000 a year to manufacturing-related activities at MIT, including the INM membership fee of $275,000 per year, which supports several core activities that engage the industry members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major thrust for INM industry collaboration is the deployment and adoption of AI and automation in manufacturing. This effort will include seed research projects at MIT, collaborative case studies, and shared strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM also offers companies participation in the MIT-wide New Manufacturing Research effort, which is studying the trajectories of specific manufacturing industries and examining cross-cutting themes such as technology and financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, INM will concentrate on education for all professions in manufacturing, with alliances bringing together corporations, community colleges, government agencies, and other partners. “We'll scale our curriculum to broader audiences, from aspiring manufacturing workers and aspiring production line supervisors all the way up to engineers and executives,” says Hart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In workforce training, INM will collaborate with companies broadly to help understand the challenges and frame its overall workforce agenda, and with individual firms on specific challenges, such as acquiring suitably prepared employees for a new factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, industry partners will also engage directly with students. Founding member Flex, for instance, hosted MIT researchers and students at the Flex Institute of Technology in Sorocaba, Brazil, developing new solutions for electronics manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“History shows that you need to innovate in manufacturing alongside the innovation in products,” Hart comments. “At MIT, as more students take classes in manufacturing, they’ll think more about key manufacturing issues as they decide what research problems they want to solve, or what choices they make as they prototype their devices. The same is true for industry — companies that operate at the frontier of manufacturing, whether through internal capabilities or their supply chains, are positioned to be on the frontier of product innovation and overall growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll have an opportunity to bring manufacturing upstream to the early stage of research, designing new processes and new devices with scalability in mind,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MIT expects to open new manufacturing-related labs and to further broaden cooperation with industry at existing shared facilities, such as MIT.nano. Hart says that facilities will also invite tighter collaborations with corporations — not just providing advanced equipment, but working jointly on, say, new technologies for weaving textiles, or speeding up battery manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homing in on the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM is a global project that brings a particular focus on the United States, which remains the world’s second-largest manufacturing economy, but has suffered a significant decline in manufacturing employment and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key to reversing this trend and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing base is advocacy for manufacturing’s critical role in society and the career opportunities it offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one really disputes the importance of manufacturing,” Hart says. “But we need to elevate interest in manufacturing as a rewarding career, from the production workers to manufacturing engineers and leaders, through advocacy, education programs, and buy-in from industry, government, and academia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT is in a unique position to convene industry, academic, and government stakeholders in manufacturing to work together on this vital issue, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in times of radical and rapid changes in manufacturing, “we need to focus on deploying new technologies into factories and supply chains,” Hart says. “Technology is not all of the solution, but for the U.S. to expand our manufacturing base, we need to do it with technology as a key enabler, embracing companies of all sizes, including small and medium enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI becomes more capable, and automation becomes more flexible and more available, these are key building blocks upon which you can address manufacturing challenges,” he says. “AI and automation offer new accelerated ways to develop, deploy, and monitor production processes, which present a huge opportunity and, in some cases, a necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While manufacturing is always a combination of old technology, new technology, established practice, and new ways of thinking, digital technology gives manufacturers an opportunity to leapfrog competitors,” Hart says. “That’s very, very powerful for the U.S. and any company, or country, that aims to create differentiated capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in recent years, investors have increasingly bought into new manufacturing in the United States. “They see the opportunity to re-industrialize, to build the factories and production systems of the future,” Hart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That said, building new manufacturing is capital-intensive, and takes time,” he adds. “So that’s another area where it’s important to convene stakeholders and to think about how startups and growth-stage companies build their capital portfolios, how large industry can support an ecosystem of small businesses and young companies, and how to develop talent to support those growing companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these concerns and opportunities in the manufacturing ecosystem play to MIT’s strengths. “MIT’s DNA of cross-disciplinary collaboration and working with industry can let us create a lot of impact,” Hart emphasizes. “We can understand the practical challenges. We can also explore breakthrough ideas in research and cultivate successful outcomes, all the way to new companies and partnerships. Sometimes those are seen as disparate approaches, but we like to bring them together.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/john-hart-mit-00.png?itok=W2PumkXm\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">John Hart is head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and faculty co-director of the Initiative for New Manufacturing.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: David Sella</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitnano\">MIT.nano</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/education\">Education, teaching, academics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/industry\">Industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/manufacturing\">Manufacturing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/labor-jobs\">Labor and jobs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-and-policy\">Technology and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/political-science\">Political science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Eco-driving measures could significantly reduce vehicle emissions</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/eco-driving-measures-could-significantly-reduce-vehicle-emissions-0807</link>\n  <description>New research shows automatically controlling vehicle speeds to mitigate traffic at intersections can cut carbon emissions between 11 and 22 percent.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/eco-driving-measures-could-significantly-reduce-vehicle-emissions-0807</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Any motorist who has ever waited through multiple cycles for a traffic light to turn green knows how annoying signalized intersections can be. But sitting at intersections isn’t just a drag on drivers’ patience — unproductive vehicle idling could contribute as much as 15 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. land transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale modeling study led by MIT researchers reveals that eco-driving measures, which can involve dynamically adjusting vehicle speeds to reduce stopping and excessive acceleration, could significantly reduce those CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a powerful artificial intelligence method called deep reinforcement learning, the researchers conducted an in-depth impact assessment of the factors affecting vehicle emissions in three major U.S. cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis indicates that fully adopting eco-driving measures could cut annual city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11 to 22 percent, without slowing traffic throughput or affecting vehicle and traffic safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles on the road employ eco-driving, it would result in 25 to 50 percent of the total reduction in CO2 emissions, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, dynamically optimizing speed limits at about 20 percent of intersections provides 70 percent of the total emission benefits. This indicates that eco-driving measures could be implemented gradually while still having measurable, positive impacts on mitigating climate change and improving public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/inline/eco-driving.gif\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-uuid=\"49a19790-c04e-4465-ad70-9841001a6200\" data-entity-type=\"file\" alt=\"Two intersections with lots of cars; the 100% adoption has less traffic.\" width=\"521\" height=\"333\" data-caption=\"An animated GIF compares what 20% eco-driving adoption looks like to 100% eco-driving adoption.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Image: Courtesy of the researchers\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vehicle-based control strategies like eco-driving can move the needle on climate change reduction. We’ve shown here that modern machine-learning tools, like deep reinforcement learning, can accelerate the kinds of analysis that support sociotechnical decision making. This is just the tip of the iceberg,” says senior author Cathy Wu, the Class of 1954 Career Development Associate Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, and a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by lead author Vindula Jayawardana, an MIT graduate student; as well as MIT graduate students Ao Qu, Cameron Hickert, and Edgar Sanchez; MIT undergraduate Catherine Tang; Baptiste Freydt, a graduate student at ETH Zurich; and Mark Taylor and Blaine Leonard of the Utah Department of Transportation.

But as vehicles become more technologically advanced, it presents an opportunity for eco-driving, which is a catch-all term for vehicle-based traffic control measures like the use of dynamic speeds to reduce energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, eco-driving could involve speed guidance in the form of vehicle dashboards or smartphone apps. In the longer term, eco-driving could involve intelligent speed commands that directly control the acceleration of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most prior work has focused on how&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to implement eco-driving. We shifted the frame to consider the question of should&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;we implement eco-driving. If we were to deploy this technology at scale, would it make a difference?” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, the researchers embarked on a multifaceted modeling study that would take the better part of four years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began by identifying 33 factors that influence vehicle emissions, including temperature, road grade, intersection topology, age of the vehicle, traffic demand, vehicle types, driver behavior, traffic signal timing, road geometry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges was making sure we were diligent and didn’t leave out any major factors,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they used data from OpenStreetMap, U.S. geological surveys, and other sources to create digital replicas of more than 6,000 signalized intersections in three cities — Atlanta, San Francisco, and Los Angeles — and simulated more than a million traffic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used deep reinforcement learning to optimize each scenario for eco-driving to achieve the maximum emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning optimizes the vehicles’ driving behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a high-fidelity traffic simulator, rewarding vehicle behaviors that are more energy-efficient while penalizing those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cast the problem as a decentralized cooperative multi-agent control problem, where the vehicles cooperate to achieve overall energy efficiency, even among non-participating vehicles, and they act in a decentralized manner, avoiding the need for costly communication between vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, training vehicle behaviors that generalize across diverse intersection traffic scenarios was a major challenge. The researchers observed that some scenarios are more similar to one another than others, such as scenarios with the same number of lanes or the same number of traffic signal phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the researchers trained separate reinforcement learning models for different clusters of traffic scenarios, yielding better emission benefits overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with the help of AI, analyzing citywide traffic at the network level would be so computationally intensive it could take another decade to unravel, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they broke the problem down and solved each eco-driving scenario at the individual intersection level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carefully constrained the impact of eco-driving control at each intersection on neighboring intersections. In this way, we dramatically simplified the problem, which enabled us to perform this analysis at scale, without introducing unknown network effects,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant emissions benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they analyzed the results, the researchers found that full adoption of eco-driving could result in intersection emissions reductions of between 11 and 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits differ depending on the layout of a city’s streets. A denser city like San Francisco has less room to implement eco-driving between intersections, offering a possible explanation for reduced emission savings, while Atlanta could see greater benefits given its higher speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles employ eco-driving, a city could still realize 25 to 50 percent of the total emissions benefit because of car-following dynamics: Non-eco-driving vehicles would follow controlled eco-driving vehicles as they optimize speed to pass smoothly through intersections, reducing their carbon emissions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, eco-driving could also increase vehicle throughput by minimizing emissions. However, Wu cautions that increasing throughput could result in more drivers taking to the roads, reducing emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while their analysis of widely used safety metrics known as surrogate safety measures, such as time to collision, suggest that eco-driving is as safe as human driving, it could cause unexpected behavior in human drivers. More research is needed to fully understand potential safety impacts, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results also show that eco-driving could provide even greater benefits when combined with alternative transportation decarbonization solutions. For instance, 20 percent eco-driving adoption in San Francisco would cut emission levels by 7 percent, but when combined with the projected adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, it would cut emissions by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a first attempt to systematically quantify network-wide environmental benefits of eco-driving. This is a great research effort that will serve as a key reference for others to build on in the assessment of eco-driving systems,” says Hesham Rakha, the Samuel L. Pritchard Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech, who was not involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the researchers focus on carbon emissions, the benefits are highly correlated with improvements in fuel consumption, energy use, and air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is almost a free intervention. We already have smartphones in our cars, and we are rapidly adopting cars with more advanced automation features. For something to scale quickly in practice, it must be relatively simple to implement and shovel-ready. Eco-driving fits that bill,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by Amazon and the Utah Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-EcoDriving-01-press.jpg?itok=qAjylkrY\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Implementing co-driving techniques can significantly reduce intersection carbon dioxide emissions without impacting traffic throughput or safety, according to new MIT research.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/transportation\">Transportation</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cities\">Cities</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/autonomous-vehicles\">Autonomous vehicles</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/civil-engineering\">Civil and environmental engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>School of Architecture and Planning welcomes new faculty for 2025</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/school-architecture-planning-welcomes-new-faculty-0806</link>\n  <description>Four new professors join the Department of Architecture and MIT Media Lab.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:10:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/school-architecture-planning-welcomes-new-faculty-0806</guid>\n        <dc:creator>School of Architecture and Planning</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four new faculty members join the School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P) this fall, offering the MIT community creativity, knowledge, and scholarship in multidisciplinary roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These individuals add considerable strength and depth to our faculty,” says Hashim Sarkis, dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. “We are excited for the academic vigor they bring to research and teaching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/karrie-karahalios-announce/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karrie G.

That’s because traditional data storage systems were designed to handle simple commands from a handful of users at once, whereas today, AI systems with millions of agents need to continuously access and process large amounts of data in parallel. Traditional data storage systems now have layers of complexity, which slows AI systems down because data must pass through multiple tiers before reaching the graphical processing units (GPUs) that are the brain cells of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian, co-founded by Michael Tso ’93, SM ’93 and Hiroshi Ohta, is helping storage keep up with the AI revolution. The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models. The system reduces complexity by applying parallel computing to data storage, consolidating AI functions and data onto a single parallel-processing platform that stores, retrieves, and processes scalable datasets, with direct, high-speed transfers between storage and GPUs and CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s integrated storage-computing platform simplifies the process of building commercial-scale AI tools and gives businesses a storage foundation that can keep up with the rise of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things people miss about AI is that it’s all about the data,” Tso says. “You can’t get a 10 percent improvement in AI performance with 10 percent more data or even 10 times more data — you need 1,000 times more data. Being able to store that data in a way that’s easy to manage, and in such a way that you can embed computations into it so you can run operations while the data is coming in without moving the data — that’s where this industry is going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From MIT to industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at MIT in the 1990s, Tso was introduced by Professor William Dally to parallel computing — a type of computation in which many calculations occur simultaneously. Tso also worked on parallel computing with Associate Professor Greg Papadopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an incredible time because most schools had one super-computing project going on — MIT had four,” Tso recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Tso worked with MIT senior research scientist David Clark, a computing pioneer who contributed to the internet’s early architecture, particularly the transmission control protocol (TCP) that delivers data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a graduate student at MIT, I worked on disconnected and intermittent networking operations for large scale distributed systems,” Tso says. “It’s funny — 30 years on, that’s what I’m still doing today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his graduation, Tso worked at Intel’s Architecture Lab, where he invented data synchronization algorithms used by Blackberry. He also created specifications for Nokia that ignited the ringtone download industry. He then joined Inktomi, a startup co-founded by Eric Brewer SM ’92, PhD ’94 that pioneered search and web content distribution technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Tso started Gemini Mobile Technologies with Joseph Norton ’93, SM ’93 and others. The company went on to build the world’s largest mobile messaging systems to handle the massive data growth from camera phones. Then, in the late 2000s, cloud computing became a powerful way for businesses to rent virtual servers as they grew their operations. Tso noticed the amount of data being collected was growing far faster than the speed of networking, so he decided to pivot the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data is being created in a lot of different places, and that data has its own gravity: It’s going to cost you money and time to move it,” Tso explains. “That means the end state is a distributed cloud that reaches out to edge devices and servers. You have to bring the cloud to the data, not the data to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tso officially launched Cloudian out of Gemini Mobile Technologies in 2012, with a new emphasis on helping customers with scalable, distributed, cloud-compatible data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t see when we first started the company was that AI was going to be the ultimate use case for data on the edge,” Tso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Tso’s research at MIT began more than two decades ago, he sees strong connections between what he worked on and the industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like my whole life is playing back because David Clark and I were dealing with disconnected and intermittently connected networks, which are part of every edge use case today, and Professor Dally was working on very fast, scalable interconnects,” Tso says, noting that Dally is now the senior vice president and chief scientist at the leading AI company NVIDIA. “Now, when you look at the modern NVIDIA chip architecture and the way they do interchip communication, it’s got Dally’s work all over it. With Professor Papadopoulos, I worked on accelerate application software with parallel computing hardware without having to rewrite the applications, and that’s exactly the problem we are trying to solve with NVIDIA. Coincidentally, all the stuff I was doing at MIT is playing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Cloudian’s platform uses an object storage architecture in which all kinds of data —documents, videos, sensor data — are stored as a unique object with metadata. Object storage can manage massive datasets in a flat file stucture, making it ideal for unstructured data and AI systems, but it traditionally hasn’t been able to send data directly to AI models without the data first being copied into a computer’s memory system, creating latency and energy bottlenecks for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Cloudian announced that it has extended its object storage system with a vector database that stores data in a form which is immediately usable by AI models. As the data are ingested, Cloudian is computing in real-time the vector form of that data to power AI tools like recommender engines, search, and AI assistants. Cloudian also announced a partnership with NVIDIA that allows its storage system to work directly with the AI company’s GPUs. Cloudian says the new system enables even faster AI operations and reduces computing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA contacted us about a year and a half ago because GPUs are useful only with data that keeps them busy,” Tso says. “Now that people are realizing it’s easier to move the AI to the data than it is to move huge datasets. Our storage systems embed a lot of AI functions, so we’re able to pre- and post-process data for AI near where we collect and store the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-first storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian is helping about 1,000 companies around the world get more value out of their data, including large manufacturers, financial service providers, health care organizations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s storage platform is helping one large automaker, for instance, use AI to determine when each of its manufacturing robots need to be serviced. Cloudian is also working with the National Library of Medicine to store research articles and patents, and the National Cancer Database to store DNA sequences of tumors — rich datasets that AI models could process to help research develop new treatments or gain new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GPUs have been an incredible enabler,” Tso says. “Moore’s Law doubles the amount of compute every two years, but GPUs are able to parallelize operations on chips, so you can network GPUs together and shatter Moore’s Law. That scale is pushing AI to new levels of intelligence, but the only way to make GPUs work hard is to feed them data at the same speed that they compute — and the only way to do that is to get rid of all the layers between them and your data.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Cloudian-01.jpg?itok=j9Gg2rpo\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/alumni\">Alumni/ae</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT tool visualizes and edits “physically impossible” objects</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-meschers-tool-visualizes-edits-physically-impossible-objects-0804</link>\n  <description>By visualizing Escher-like optical illusions in 2.5 dimensions, the “Meschers” tool could help scientists understand physics-defying shapes and spark new designs.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:40:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-meschers-tool-visualizes-edits-physically-impossible-objects-0804</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Alex Shipps | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-00f766d6-7fff-403a-378d-5aaf2f5b25af\"&gt;M.C. Escher’s artwork is a gateway into a world of depth-defying optical illusions, featuring “impossible objects” that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries. What you perceive his illustrations to be depends on your point of view — for example, a person seemingly walking upstairs may be heading down the steps if you tilt your head&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.54256.html\"&gt;sideways&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Computer graphics scientists and designers can recreate these illusions in 3D, but only by bending or cutting a real shape and positioning it at a particular angle. This workaround has downsides, though: Changing the smoothness or lighting of the structure will expose that it isn’t actually an optical illusion, which also means you can’t accurately solve geometry problems on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a unique approach to represent “impossible” objects in a more versatile way. Their “&lt;a href=\"https://anadodik.github.io/publication/meschers/\"&gt;Meschers&lt;/a&gt;” tool converts images and 3D models into 2.5-dimensional structures, creating Escher-like depictions of things like windows, buildings, and even donuts. The approach helps users relight, smooth out, and study unique geometries while preserving their optical illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tool could assist geometry researchers with calculating the distance between two points on a curved impossible surface (“geodesics”) and simulating how heat dissipates over it (“heat diffusion”). It could also help artists and computer graphics scientists create physics-breaking designs in multiple dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lead author and MIT PhD student Ana Dodik aims to design computer graphics tools that aren’t limited to replicating reality, enabling artists to express their intent independently of whether a shape can be realized in the physical world. “Using Meschers, we’ve unlocked a new class of shapes for artists to work with on the computer,” she says. “They could also help perception scientists understand the point at which an object truly becomes impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Dodik and her colleagues will present their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://anadodik.github.io/publication/meschers/Meschers.pdf\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; at the SIGGRAPH conference in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making impossible objects possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Impossible objects can’t be fully replicated in 3D. Their constituent parts often look plausible, but these parts don’t glue together properly when assembled in 3D. But what can be computationally imitated, as the CSAIL researchers found out, is the process of how we perceive these shapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/impossible-triangle\"&gt;Penrose Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. The object as a whole is physically impossible because the depths don’t “add up,” but we can recognize real-world 3D shapes (like its three L-shaped corners) within it. These smaller regions can be realized in 3D — a property called “local consistency” — but when we try to assemble them together, they don’t form a globally consistent shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Meschers approach models’ locally consistent regions without forcing them to be globally consistent, piecing together an Escher-esque structure. Behind the scenes, Meschers represents impossible objects as if we know their x and y coordinates in the image, as well as differences in z coordinates (depth) between neighboring pixels; the tool uses these differences in depth to reason about impossible objects indirectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many uses of Meschers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to rendering impossible objects, Meschers can subdivide their structures into smaller shapes for more precise geometry calculations and smoothing operations. This process enabled the researchers to reduce visual imperfections of impossible shapes, such as a red heart outline they thinned out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also tested their tool on an “impossibagel,” where a bagel is shaded in a physically impossible way. Meschers helped Dodik and her colleagues simulate heat diffusion and calculate geodesic distances between different points of the model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Imagine you’re an ant traversing this bagel, and you want to know how long it’ll take you to get across, for example,” says Dodik. “In the same way, our tool could help mathematicians analyze the underlying geometry of impossible shapes up close, much like how we study real-world ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Much like a magician, the tool can create optical illusions out of otherwise practical objects, making it easier for computer graphics artists to create impossible objects. It can also use “inverse rendering” tools to convert drawings and images of impossible objects into high-dimensional designs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Meschers demonstrates how computer graphics tools don’t have to be constrained by the rules of physical reality,” says senior author Justin Solomon, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and leader of the CSAIL Geometric Data Processing Group. “Incredibly, artists using Meschers can reason about shapes that we will never find in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Meschers can also aid computer graphics artists with tweaking the shading of their creations, while still preserving an optical illusion. This versatility would allow creatives to change the lighting of their art to depict a wider variety of scenes (like a sunrise or sunset) — as Meschers demonstrated by relighting a model of a dog on a skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Despite its versatility, Meschers is just the start for Dodik and her colleagues. The team is considering designing an interface to make the tool easier to use while building more elaborate scenes. They’re also working with perception scientists to see how the computer graphics tool can be used more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dodik and Solomon wrote the paper with CSAIL affiliates Isabella Yu ’24, SM ’25; PhD student Kartik Chandra SM ’23; MIT professors Jonathan Ragan-Kelley and Joshua Tenenbaum; and MIT Assistant Professor Vincent Sitzmann.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their work was supported, in part, by the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Mathworks Fellowship, the Hertz Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Schmidt Sciences AI2050 fellowship, MIT Quest for Intelligence, the U.S. Army Research Office, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, SystemsThatLearn@CSAIL initiative, Google, the MIT–IBM Watson AI Laboratory, from the Toyota–CSAIL Joint Research Center, Adobe Systems, the Singapore Defence Science and Technology Agency, and the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/mit-csail-Meschers.jpg?itok=mwr0SOLG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“Meschers” can create multi-dimensional versions of objects that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries, such as buildings you might see in an M.C.

In computer science parlance, the molecule is “symmetric,” meaning the fundamental structure of that molecule remains the same if it undergoes certain transformations, like rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a drug discovery model doesn’t understand symmetry, it could make inaccurate predictions about molecular properties. But despite some empirical successes, it’s been unclear whether there is a computationally efficient method to train a good model that is guaranteed to respect symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new study by MIT researchers answers this question, and shows the first method for machine learning with symmetry that is provably efficient in terms of both the amount of computation and data needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results clarify a foundational question, and they could aid researchers in the development of more powerful machine-learning models that are designed to handle symmetry. Such models would be useful in a variety of applications, from discovering new materials to identifying astronomical anomalies to unraveling complex climate patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These symmetries are important because they are some sort of information that nature is telling us about the data, and we should take it into account in our machine-learning models. We’ve now shown that it is possible to do machine-learning with symmetric data in an efficient way,” says Behrooz Tahmasebi, an MIT graduate student and co-lead author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19758\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by co-lead author and MIT graduate student Ashkan Soleymani; Stefanie Jegelka, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) and a member of the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and senior author Patrick Jaillet, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symmetric data appear in many domains, especially the natural sciences and physics. A model that recognizes symmetries is able to identify an object, like a car, no matter where that object is placed in an image, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless a machine-learning model is designed to handle symmetry, it could be less accurate and prone to failure when faced with new symmetric data in real-world situations. On the flip side, models that take advantage of symmetry could be faster and require fewer data for training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But training a model to process symmetric data is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common approach is called data augmentation, where researchers transform each symmetric data point into multiple data points to help the model generalize better to new data. For instance, one could rotate a molecular structure many times to produce new training data, but if researchers want the model to be guaranteed to respect symmetry, this can be computationally prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach is to encode symmetry into the model’s architecture. A well-known example of this is a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently handles symmetric data because of how it is designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Graph neural networks are fast and efficient, and they take care of symmetry quite well, but nobody really knows what these models are learning or why they work. Understanding GNNs is a main motivation of our work, so we started with a theoretical evaluation of what happens when data are symmetric,” Tahmasebi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explored the statistical-computational tradeoff in machine learning with symmetric data. This tradeoff means methods that require fewer data can be more computationally expensive, so researchers need to find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this theoretical evaluation, the researchers designed an efficient algorithm for machine learning with symmetric data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical combinations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they borrowed ideas from algebra to shrink and simplify the problem. Then, they reformulated the problem using ideas from geometry that effectively capture symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they combined the algebra and the geometry into an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently, resulting in their new algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the theory and applications were focusing on either algebra or geometry. Here we just combined them,” Tahmasebi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm requires fewer data samples for training than classical approaches, which would improve a model’s accuracy and ability to adapt to new applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By proving that scientists can develop efficient algorithms for machine learning with symmetry, and demonstrating how it can be done, these results could lead to the development of new neural network architectures that could be more accurate and less resource-intensive than current models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists could also use this analysis as a starting point to examine the inner workings of GNNs, and how their operations differ from the algorithm the MIT researchers developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we know that better, we can design more interpretable, more robust, and more efficient neural network architectures,” adds Soleymani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the National Research Foundation of Singapore, DSO National Laboratories of Singapore, the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Learning-Symmetric-01.jpg?itok=jTPWN5G8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study by MIT researchers shows the first method for machine learning with symmetry that is provably efficient in terms of both the amount of computation and data needed.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock, MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nsf\">National Science Foundation (NSF)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>“FUTURE PHASES” showcases new frontiers in music technology and interactive performance</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/future-phases-showcase-new-frontiers-music-technology-interactive-performance-0729</link>\n  <description>Groundbreaking MIT concert, featuring electronic and computer-generated music, was a part of the 2025 International Computer Music Conference.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/future-phases-showcase-new-frontiers-music-technology-interactive-performance-0729</guid>\n        <dc:creator>MIT Music and Theater Arts</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Music technology took center stage at MIT during “FUTURE PHASES,” an evening of works for string orchestra and electronics, presented by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://musictech.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program&lt;/a&gt; as part of the 2025 International Computer Music Conference (ICMC).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event was held last month in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall within the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building. Produced in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future Group and Boston’s self-conducted chamber orchestra A Far Cry, “FUTURE PHASES” was the first event to be presented by the MIT Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program in MIT Music’s new space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“FUTURE PHASES” offerings included two new works by MIT composers: the world premiere of&amp;nbsp;“EV6,” by MIT Music’s Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor Evan Ziporyn and professor of the practice Eran Egozy; and the U.S. premiere of&amp;nbsp;“FLOW Symphony,” by the MIT Media Lab’s Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media Tod Machover. Three additional works were selected by a jury from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://icmc2025.sites.northeastern.edu/special-call-for-scores-mit/\"&gt;an open call&lt;/a&gt; for works:&amp;nbsp;“The Wind Will Carry Us Away,” by Ali Balighi; “A Blank Page,” by Celeste Betancur&amp;nbsp;Gutiérrez and Luna Valentin; and “Coastal Portrait: Cycles and Thresholds,”&amp;nbsp;by Peter Lane. Each work was performed by&amp;nbsp;Boston’s own&amp;nbsp;multi-Grammy-nominated string orchestra, A Far Cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ICMC is all about presenting the latest research, compositions, and performances in electronic music,” says Egozy,&amp;nbsp;director of the new Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program at MIT. When approached to be a part of this year’s conference, “it seemed the perfect opportunity to showcase MIT’s commitment&amp;nbsp;to music technology, and in particular the exciting new areas being developed right now: a new master’s program in music technology and computation, the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building with its enhanced music technology facilities, and new faculty arriving at MIT with joint appointments between &lt;a href=\"https://mta.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts&lt;/a&gt; (MTA) and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).” These recently hired professors include Anna Huang, a keynote speaker for the conference and creator of the machine learning model&amp;nbsp;Coconet that powered Google’s first AI Doodle, the &lt;a href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet\"&gt;Bach Doodle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy emphasizes the uniqueness of this occasion: “You have to understand that this is a very special situation. Having a full 18-member string orchestra [A Far Cry] perform new works that include electronics does not happen very often. In most cases, ICMC performances consist either entirely of electronics and computer-generated music, or perhaps a small ensemble of two-to-four musicians. So the opportunity we could present to the larger community of music technology was particularly exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this exciting opportunity, an open call was put out internationally to select the other pieces that would accompany Ziporyn and Egozy’s “EV6” and Machover’s “FLOW Symphony.” Three pieces were selected from a total of 46 entries to be a part of the evening’s program by a panel of judges that included Egozy, Machover, and other distinguished composers and technologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We received a huge variety of works from this call,” says Egozy. “We saw all kinds of musical styles and ways that electronics would be used. No two pieces were very similar to each other, and I think because of that, our audience got a sense of how varied and interesting a concert can be for this format. A Far Cry was really the unifying presence. They played all pieces with great passion and nuance. They have a way of really drawing audiences into the music. And, of course, with the Thomas Tull Concert Hall being in the round, the audience felt even more connected to the music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy continues, “we took advantage of the technology built into the Thomas Tull Concert Hall, which has 24 built-in speakers for surround sound allowing us to broadcast unique, amplified sound to every seat in the house. Chances are that every person might have experienced the sound slightly differently, but there was always some sense of a multidimensional evolution of sound and music as the pieces unfolded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five works of the evening employed a range of technological components that included playing synthesized, prerecorded, or electronically manipulated sounds; attaching microphones to instruments for use in real-time signal processing algorithms; broadcasting custom-generated musical notation to&amp;nbsp;the musicians; utilizing generative AI to process live sound and play it back in interesting and unpredictable ways; and audience participation, where spectators use their cellphones as musical instruments to become a part of the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziporyn and Egozy’s piece, “EV6&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; took particular advantage of this last innovation: “Evan and I had previously collaborated on a system called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://musictech.mit.edu/tutti/\"&gt;Tutti&lt;/a&gt;, which means ‘together’ in Italian. Tutti gives an audience the ability to use their smartphones as musical instruments so that we can all play together.” Egozy developed the technology, which was first used in the MIT Campaign for a Better World in 2017. The original application involved a three-minute piece for cellphones only. “But for this concert,” Egozy explains, “Evan had the idea that we could use the same technology to write a new piece — this time, for audience phones and a live string orchestra as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the piece’s title, Ziporyn says, “I drive an EV6; it’s my first electric car, and when I first got it, it felt like I was driving an iPhone. But of course it’s still just a car: it’s got wheels and an engine, and it gets me from one place to another. It seemed like a good metaphor for this piece, in which a lot of the sound is literally played on cellphones, but still has to work like any other piece of music. It’s also a bit of an homage to David Bowie’s song ‘TVC 15,’ which is about falling in love with a robot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy adds, “We wanted audience members to feel what it is like to play together in an orchestra. Through this technology, each audience member becomes a part of an orchestral section (winds, brass, strings, etc.). As they play together, they can hear their whole section playing similar music while also hearing other sections in different parts of the hall play different music. This allows an audience to feel a responsibility to their section, hear how music can move between different sections of an orchestra, and experience the thrill of live performance. In ‘EV6,’ this experience was even more electrifying because everyone in the audience got to play with a live string orchestra — perhaps for the first time in recorded history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the concert, guests were treated to six music technology demonstrations that showcased the research of undergraduate and graduate students from both the MIT Music program and the MIT Media Lab. These included a gamified interface for harnessing just intonation systems (Antonis Christou); insights from a human-AI co-created concert (Lancelot Blanchard and Perry Naseck); a system for analyzing piano playing data across campus (Ayyub Abdulrezak ’24, MEng ’25); capturing music features from audio using latent frequency-masked autoencoders (Mason Wang); a device that turns any surface into a drum machine (Matthew Caren ’25); and a play-along interface for learning traditional Senegalese rhythms (Mariano Salcedo ’25). This last example led to the creation of Senegroove, a drumming-based application specifically designed for an upcoming edX online course taught by ethnomusicologist and MIT associate professor in music Patricia Tang, and world-renowned Senegalese drummer and MIT lecturer in music Lamine Touré, who provided performance videos of the foundational rhythms used in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Egozy muses, “'FUTURE PHASES' showed how having the right space — in this case, the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building — really can be a driving force for new ways of thinking, new projects, and new ways of collaborating. My hope is that everyone in the MIT community, the Boston area, and beyond soon discovers what a truly amazing place and space we have built, and are still building here, for music and music technology at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-MTA-6-13-25-335_0.jpg?itok=X_GvlV7G\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A Far Cry performs “EV6” as part of the “FUTURE PHASES” concert at MIT.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Jonathan Sachs</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/performances\">Performances</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music2\">Music</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/arts\">Arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music\">Music technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electronics\">Electronics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/media-lab-0\">Media Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music-and-theater-arts\">Music and theater arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Pedestrians now walk faster and linger less, researchers find</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/pedestrians-now-walk-faster-and-linger-less-researchers-find-0724</link>\n  <description>A computer vision study compares changes in pedestrian behavior since 1980, providing information for urban designers about creating public spaces.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:45:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/pedestrians-now-walk-faster-and-linger-less-researchers-find-0724</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;City life is often described as “fast-paced.” A new study suggests that’s more true than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-authored by MIT scholars, shows that the average walking speed of pedestrians in three northeastern U.S. cities increased 15 percent from 1980 to 2010. The number of people lingering in public spaces declined by 14 percent in that time as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used machine-learning tools to assess 1980s-era video footage captured by renowned urbanist William Whyte, in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They compared the old material with newer videos from the same locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something has changed over the past 40 years,” says MIT professor of the practice Carlo Ratti, a co-author of the new study. “How fast we walk, how people meet in public space — what we’re seeing here is that public spaces are working in somewhat different ways, more as a thoroughfare and less a space of encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424662122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Exploring the social life of urban spaces through AI&lt;/a&gt;,” is published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. The co-authors are Arianna Salazar-Miranda MCP ’16, PhD ’23, an assistant professor at Yale University’s School of the Environment; Zhuanguan Fan of the University of Hong Kong; Michael Baick; Keith N. Hampton, a professor at Michigan State University; Fabio Duarte, associate director of the Senseable City Lab; Becky P.Y. Loo of the University of Hong Kong; Edward Glaeser,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics at Harvard University; and Ratti, who is also director of MIT’s Senseable City Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results could help inform urban planning, as designers seek to create new public areas or modify existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public space is such an important element of civic life, and today partly because it counteracts the polarization of digital space,” says Salazar-Miranda. “The more we can keep improving public space, the more we can make our cities suited for convening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet you at the Met&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte was a prominent social thinker whose famous 1956 book, “The Organization Man,” probing the apparent culture of corporate conformity in the U.S., became a touchstone of its decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Whyte spent the latter decades of his career focused on urbanism. The footage he filmed, from 1978 through 1980, was archived by a Brooklyn-based nonprofit organization called the Project for Public Spaces and later digitized by Hampton and his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte chose to make his recording at four spots in the three cities combined: Boston’s Downtown Crossing area; New York City’s Bryant Park; the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a famous gathering point and people-watching spot; and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a group led by Hampton then shot new footage at those locations, at the same times of day Whyte had, to compare and contrast current-day dynamics with those of Whyte’s time. To conduct the study, the co-authors used computer vision and AI models to summarize and quantify the activity in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have found that some things have not changed greatly. The percentage of people walking alone barely moved, from 67 percent in 1980 to 68 percent in 2010. On the other hand, the percentage of individuals entering these public spaces who became part of a group declined a bit. In 1980, 5.5 percent of the people approaching these spots met up with a group; in 2010, that was down to 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there’s a more transactional nature to public space today,” Ratti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer outdoor groups: Anomie or Starbucks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people’s behavioral patterns have altered since 1980, it’s natural to ask why. Certainly some of the visible changes seem consistent with the pervasive use of cellphones; people organize their social lives by phone now, and perhaps zip around more quickly from place to place as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the footage from William Whyte, the people in public spaces were looking at each other more,” Ratti says. “It was a place you could start a conversation or run into a friend. You couldn’t do things online then. Today, behavior is more predicated on texting first, to meet in public space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scholars note, if groups of people hang out together slightly less often in public spaces, there could be still another reason for that: Starbucks and its competitors. As the paper states, outdoor group socializing may be less common due to “the proliferation of coffee shops and other indoor venues. Instead of lingering on sidewalks, people may have moved their social interactions into air-conditioned, more comfortable private spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly coffeeshops were far less common in big cities in 1980, and the big chain coffeeshops did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, public-space behavior might have been evolving all this time regardless of Starbucks and the like. The researchers say the new study offers a proof-of-concept for its method and has encouraged them to conduct additional work. Ratti, Duarte, and other researchers from MIT’s Senseable City Lab have turned their attention to an extensive survey of European public spaces in an attempt to shed more light on the interaction between people and the public forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are collecting footage from 40 squares in Europe,” Duarte says. “The question is: How can we learn at a larger scale? This is in part what we’re doing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Urban-Walking-01.jpg?itok=YTbccwQn\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study finds that people walk faster and linger less in urban settings.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/urban-studies\">Urban studies and planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cities\">Cities</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-vision\">Computer vision</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/social-media\">Social media</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New machine-learning application to help researchers predict chemical properties</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/chemxploreml-app-helps-predict-chemical-properties-0724</link>\n  <description>ChemXploreML makes advanced chemical predictions easier and faster — without requiring deep programming skills.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/chemxploreml-app-helps-predict-chemical-properties-0724</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Danielle Randall Doughty | Department of Chemistry</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One of the shared, fundamental goals of most chemistry researchers is the need to predict a molecule’s properties, such as its boiling or melting point. Once researchers can pinpoint that prediction, they’re able to move forward with their work yielding discoveries that lead to medicines, materials, and more. Historically, however, the traditional methods of unveiling these predictions are associated with a significant cost — expending time and wear and tear on equipment, in addition to funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enter a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (ML). ML has lessened the burden of molecule property prediction to a degree, but the advanced tools that most effectively expedite the process — by learning from existing data to make rapid predictions for new molecules — require the user to have a significant level of programming expertise. This creates an accessibility barrier for many chemists, who may not have the significant computational proficiency required to navigate the prediction pipeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To alleviate this challenge, researchers in the &lt;a href=\"https://mcguirelab.mit.edu/\"&gt;McGuire Research Group&lt;/a&gt; at MIT have created &lt;a href=\"https://aravindhnivas.github.io/ChemXploreML-docs/\"&gt;ChemXploreML&lt;/a&gt;, a user-friendly desktop app that helps chemists make these critical predictions without requiring advanced programming skills. Freely available, easy to download, and functional on mainstream platforms, this app is also built to operate entirely offline, which helps keep research data proprietary. The exciting new technology is outlined in an &lt;a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00516\"&gt;article published recently in&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One specific hurdle in chemical machine learning is translating molecular structures into a numerical language that computers can understand. ChemXploreML automates this complex process with powerful, built-in \"molecular embedders\" that transform chemical structures into informative numerical vectors. Next, the software implements state-of-the-art algorithms to identify patterns and accurately predict molecular properties like boiling and melting points, all through an intuitive, interactive graphical interface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"The goal of ChemXploreML is to democratize the use of machine learning in the chemical sciences,” says&amp;nbsp;Aravindh Nivas Marimuthu, a postdoc in the McGuire Group and lead author of the article. “By creating an intuitive, powerful, and offline-capable desktop application, we are putting state-of-the-art predictive modeling directly into the hands of chemists, regardless of their programming background. This work not only accelerates the search for new drugs and materials by making the screening process faster and cheaper, but its flexible design also opens doors for future innovations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;ChemXploreML is designed to to evolve over time, so as future techniques and algorithms are developed, they can be seamlessly integrated into the app, ensuring that researchers are always able to access and implement the most up-to-date methods. The application was tested on five key molecular properties of organic compounds — melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, critical temperature, and critical pressure — and achieved high accuracy scores of up to 93 percent for the critical temperature. The researchers also demonstrated that a new, more compact method of representing molecules (VICGAE) was nearly as accurate as standard methods, such as Mol2Vec, but was up to 10 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“We envision a future where any researcher can easily customize and apply machine learning to solve unique challenges, from developing sustainable materials to exploring the complex chemistry of interstellar space,” says Marimuthu.

Even with today’s technology, if you wanted to make a fanciful picture of, say, a friend planting a flag on Mars or heedlessly flying into a black hole, it could take less than a second. However, before they can perform tasks like that, image generators are commonly trained on massive datasets containing millions of images that are often paired with associated text. Training these generative models can be an arduous chore that takes weeks or months, consuming vast computational resources in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if it were possible to generate images through AI methods without using a generator at all? That real possibility, along with other intriguing ideas, was described in a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08257\"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025), which was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, earlier this summer. The paper, describing novel techniques for manipulating and generating images, was written by Lukas Lao Beyer, a graduate student researcher in MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS); Tianhong Li, a postdoc at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Xinlei Chen of Facebook AI Research; Sertac Karaman, an MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics and the director of LIDS; and Kaiming He, an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group effort had its origins in a class project for a graduate seminar on deep generative models that Lao Beyer took last fall. In conversations during the semester, it became apparent to both Lao Beyer and He, who taught the seminar, that this research had real potential, which went far beyond the confines of a typical homework assignment. Other collaborators were soon brought into the endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting point for Lao Beyer’s inquiry was a June 2024 paper, written by researchers from the Technical University of Munich and the Chinese company ByteDance, which introduced a new way of representing visual information called a one-dimensional tokenizer. With this device, which is also a kind of neural network, a 256x256-pixel image can be translated into a sequence of just 32 numbers, called tokens. “I wanted to understand how such a high level of compression could be achieved, and what the tokens themselves actually represented,” says Lao Beyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous generation of tokenizers would typically break up the same image into an array of 16x16 tokens — with each token encapsulating information, in highly condensed form, that corresponds to a specific portion of the original image. The new 1D tokenizers can encode an image more efficiently, using far fewer tokens overall, and these tokens are able to capture information about the entire image, not just a single quadrant. Each of these tokens, moreover, is a 12-digit number consisting of 1s and 0s, allowing for 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (or about 4,000) possibilities altogether. “It’s like a vocabulary of 4,000 words that makes up an abstract, hidden language spoken by the computer,” He explains. “It’s not like a human language, but we can still try to find out what it means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what Lao Beyer had initially set out to explore — work that provided the seed for the ICML 2025 paper. The approach he took was pretty straightforward. If you want to find out what a particular token does, Lao Beyer says, “you can just take it out, swap in some random value, and see if there is a recognizable change in the output.” Replacing one token, he found, changes the image quality, turning a low-resolution image into a high-resolution image or vice versa. Another token affected the blurriness in the background, while another still influenced the brightness. He also found a token that’s related to the “pose,” meaning that, in the image of a robin, for instance, the bird’s head might shift from right to left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a never-before-seen result, as no one had observed visually identifiable changes from manipulating tokens,” Lao Beyer says. The finding raised the possibility of a new approach to editing images. And the MIT group has shown, in fact, how this process can be streamlined and automated, so that tokens don’t have to be modified by hand, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues achieved an even more consequential result involving image generation. A system capable of generating images normally requires a tokenizer, which compresses and encodes visual data, along with a generator that can combine and arrange these compact representations in order to create novel images. The MIT researchers found a way to create images without using a generator at all. Their new approach makes use of a 1D tokenizer and a so-called detokenizer (also known as a decoder), which can reconstruct an image from a string of tokens. However, with guidance provided by an off-the-shelf neural network called CLIP —&amp;nbsp;which cannot generate images on its own, but can measure how well a given image matches a certain text prompt&amp;nbsp;— the team was able to convert an image of a red panda, for example, into a tiger. In addition, they could create images of a tiger, or any other desired form, starting completely from scratch — from a situation in which all the tokens are initially assigned random values (and then iteratively tweaked so that the reconstructed image increasingly matches the desired text prompt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group demonstrated that with this same setup — relying on a tokenizer and detokenizer, but no generator — they could also do “inpainting,” which means filling in parts of images that had somehow been blotted out. Avoiding the use of a generator for certain tasks could lead to a significant reduction in computational costs because generators, as mentioned, normally require extensive training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might seem odd about this team’s contributions, He explains, “is that we didn’t invent anything new. We didn’t invent a 1D tokenizer, and we didn’t invent the CLIP model, either. But we did discover that new capabilities can arise when you put all these pieces together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work redefines the role of tokenizers,” comments&amp;nbsp;Saining Xie, a computer scientist at New York University. “It shows that&amp;nbsp;image tokenizers — tools usually used just to compress images — can actually do a lot more. The fact that a simple (but highly compressed) 1D tokenizer can handle tasks like inpainting or text-guided editing, without needing to train a full-blown generative model, is pretty surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhuang Liu of Princeton University agrees, saying that the work of the MIT group&amp;nbsp;“shows that we can generate and manipulate the images in a way that is much easier than we previously thought. Basically, it demonstrates that image generation can be a byproduct of a very effective image compressor, potentially reducing the cost of generating images several-fold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be many applications outside the field of computer vision, Karaman suggests. “For instance,&amp;nbsp;we could consider tokenizing the actions of robots or self-driving cars in the same way, which may rapidly broaden the impact of this work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lao Beyer is thinking along similar lines,&amp;nbsp;noting that the&amp;nbsp;extreme amount of compression afforded by 1D tokenizers allows you to do “some amazing things,” which could be applied to other fields. For example, in the area of self-driving cars, which is one of his research interests, the tokens could represent, instead of images, the different routes that a vehicle might take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xie is also intrigued by the applications that may come from these innovative ideas. “There are some really cool use cases this could unlock,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/mit-token-opt3.jpg?itok=A759koh8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A system capable of generating images normally requires a tokenizer, which compresses and encodes visual data, along with a generator that can combine and arrange these compact representations in order to create novel images.

Fast forward 24 years: The Institute has now launched a dynamic AI-enabled website for its non-degree learning opportunities, making it easier for learners around the world to discover the courses and resources available on MIT’s various learning platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Learn&lt;/a&gt; enables learners to access more than 12,700 educational resources — including introductory and advanced courses, courseware, videos, podcasts, and more — from departments across the Institute. MIT Learn is designed to seamlessly connect the existing Institute’s learning platforms in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“With MIT Learn, we’re opening access to MIT’s digital learning opportunities for millions around the world,” says Dimitris Bertsimas, vice provost for open learning. “MIT Learn elevates learning with personalized recommendations powered by AI, guiding each learner toward deeper understanding. It is a stepping stone toward a broader vision of making these opportunities even more accessible to global learners through one unified learning platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The goal for MIT Learn is twofold: to allow learners to find what they want to fulfill their curiosity, and to enable learners to develop a long-term relationship with MIT as a source of educational experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“By fostering long-term connections between learners and MIT, we not only provide a pathway to continued learning, but also advance MIT’s mission to disseminate knowledge globally,” says Ferdi Alimadhi, chief technology officer for MIT Open Learning and the lead of the MIT Learn project. “With this initial launch of MIT Learn, we’re introducing AI-powered features that leverage emerging technologies to help learners discover the right content, engage with it more deeply, and stay supported as they shape their own educational journeys.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;With its sophisticated search, browse, and discovery capability, MIT Learn allows learners to explore topics without having to understand MIT’s organizational structure or know the names of departments and programs. An AI-powered recommendation feature called “Ask Tim” complements the site’s traditional search and browsing tools, helping learners quickly find courses and resources aligned with their personal and professional goals. Learners can also prompt “Ask Tim” for a summary of a course’s structure, topics, and expectations, leading to more-informed decisions before enrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In select offerings, such as &lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/search?resource=16639\"&gt;Molecular Biology: DNA Replication and Repair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/search?resource=16799\"&gt;Genetics: The Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/search?resource=16794\"&gt;Cell Biology: Transport and Signaling&lt;/a&gt;, learners can interact with an AI assistant by asking questions about a lecture, requesting flashcards of key concepts, and obtaining instant summaries. These select offerings also feature an AI tutor to support learners as they work through problem sets, guiding them toward the next step without giving away the answers. These features, Alimadhi says, are being introduced in a limited set of courses and modules to allow the MIT Open Learning team to gather insights and improve the learning experience before expanding more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT Learn is a whole new front door to the Institute,” says Christopher Capozzola, senior associate dean for open learning, who worked with faculty across the Institute on the project. “Just as the Kendall Square renovations transformed the way that people interact with our physical campus, MIT Learn transforms how people engage with what we offer digitally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Learners who choose to create an account on MIT Learn receive personalized course recommendations and can create and curate lists of educational resources, follow their specific areas of interest, and receive notifications when new MIT content is available. They can also personalize their learning experience based on their specific interests and choose the format that is best suited to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"From anywhere and for anyone, MIT Learn makes lifelong learning more accessible and personalized, building on the Institute’s decades of global leadership in open learning,” says MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MIT Learn was designed to account for a learner’s evolving needs throughout their learning journey. It highlights supplemental study materials for middle schoolers, high schoolers, and college students, upskilling opportunities for early-career professionals, reskilling programs for those considering a career shift, and resources for educators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT has an amazing collection of learning opportunities, covering a wide range of formats,” says Eric Grimson, chancellor for academic advancement, who oversaw the initial development of MIT Learn during his time as interim vice president for open learning. “The sheer size of that collection can be daunting, so creating a platform that brings all of those offerings together, in an easily searchable framework, greatly enhances our ability to serve learners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;According to Peter Hirst, senior associate dean for executive education at MIT Sloan School of Management, one of the Institute's incredible strengths is its sheer volume and diversity of expertise, research, and learning opportunities. But it can be challenging to discover and follow all those opportunities — even for people who are immersed in the on-campus experience. MIT Learn, he says, is a solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT Learn gathers all the knowledge and learning resources offered across all of MIT into a learner-friendly, curatable repository that enables anyone and everyone, whatever their interests or learning needs,&amp;nbsp;to explore and engage in the wide range of learning resources and public certificate programs that MIT has to offer and that can help them achieve their goals,” Hirst says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MIT Learn was spearheaded by MIT Open Learning, which aims to transform teaching and learning on and off the Institute’s campus. MIT Learn was developed with the direction of former provost Cynthia Barnhart, and in cooperation with MIT Sloan Executive Education and MIT Professional Education. During the design phase, OpenCourseWare Faculty Advisory Committee Chair Michael Short and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Faculty Advisory Committee Chair Caspar Hare contributed key insights, along with other numerous faculty involved with Open Learning’s product offerings, including OpenCourseWare,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;, and MicroMasters programs. MIT Learn is also informed by the insights of the Ad Hoc Committee on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“For over 20 years, MIT staff and faculty have been creating a wealth of online resources, from lecture videos to practice problems, and from single online courses to entire credential-earning programs,” says Sara Fisher Ellison, a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Online and the faculty lead for the online&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy. “Making these resources findable, searchable, and broadly available is a natural extension of MIT’s core educational mission. MIT Learn is a big, important step in that direction. We are excited for the world to see what we have to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Looking ahead, MIT Learn will also feature selected content from the MIT Press. As MIT Learn continues to grow, Open Learning is exploring collaborations with departments across the Institute with the goal of offering the fullest possible range of educational materials from MIT to learners around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT Learn is the latest step in a long tradition of the Institute providing innovative ways for learners to access knowledge,” Barnhart says. “This AI-enabled platform delivers on the Institute’s commitment to help people launch into learning journeys that can unlock life-changing opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Learn_07212025_0.jpg?itok=n_sg0sxG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT Learn offers more than 12,700 educational resources — including introductory and advanced courses, courseware, videos, podcasts, and more — from departments across MIT. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image courtesy of MIT Open Learning.</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitx\">MITx</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-press\">MIT Press</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/office-open-learning\">Office of Open Learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/opencourseware\">OpenCourseWare</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/education\">Education, teaching, academics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/stem-education\">STEM education</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/k-12-education\">K-12 education</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/learning\">Learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/onlinelearning\">Online learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-access\">Open access</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/massive-open-online-courses-moocs\">Massive open online courses (MOOCs)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/human-computer-interaction\">Human-computer interaction</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/global\">Global</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-professional-education-0\">MIT Professional Education</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>The unique, mathematical shortcuts language models use to predict dynamic scenarios</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/unique-mathematical-shortcuts-language-models-use-to-predict-dynamic-scenarios-0721</link>\n  <description>Language models follow changing situations using clever arithmetic, instead of sequential tracking.

You may not have noticed, but each step of the way, your mind kept track of how the situation (or “state of the world”) was changing. You can imagine this as a sort of sequence of events list, which we use to update our prediction of what will happen next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Language models like ChatGPT also track changes inside their own “mind” when finishing off a block of code or anticipating what you’ll write next. They typically make educated guesses using transformers — internal architectures that help the models understand sequential data — but the systems are sometimes incorrect because of flawed thinking patterns. Identifying and tweaking these underlying mechanisms helps language models become more reliable prognosticators, especially with more dynamic tasks like forecasting weather and financial markets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But do these AI systems process developing situations like we do? A new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2503.02854v1\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; from researchers in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science shows that the models instead use clever mathematical shortcuts between each progressive step in a sequence, eventually making reasonable predictions. The team made this observation by going under the hood of language models, evaluating how closely they could keep track of objects that change position rapidly. Their findings show that engineers can control when language models use particular workarounds as a way to improve the systems’ predictive capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shell games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-5c520fa2-7fff-f3a1-cecc-40dddcfcf883\"&gt;The researchers analyzed the inner workings of these models using a clever experiment reminiscent of a classic concentration game. Ever had to guess the final location of an object after it’s placed under a cup and shuffled with identical containers? The team used a similar test, where the model guessed the final arrangement of particular digits (also called a permutation). The models were given a starting sequence, such as “42135,” and instructions about when and where to move each digit, like moving the “4” to the third position and onward, without knowing the final result.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In these experiments, transformer-based models gradually learned to predict the correct final arrangements. Instead of shuffling the digits based on the instructions they were given, though, the systems aggregated information between successive states (or individual steps within the sequence) and calculated the final permutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One go-to pattern the team observed, called the “Associative Algorithm,” essentially organizes nearby steps into groups and then calculates a final guess. You can think of this process as being structured like a tree, where the initial numerical arrangement is the “root.” As you move up the tree, adjacent steps are grouped into different branches and multiplied together. At the top of the tree is the final combination of numbers, computed by multiplying each resulting sequence on the branches together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other way language models guessed the final permutation was through a crafty mechanism called the “Parity-Associative Algorithm,” which essentially whittles down options before grouping them. It determines whether the final arrangement is the result of an even or odd number of rearrangements of individual digits. Then, the mechanism groups adjacent sequences from different steps before multiplying them, just like the Associative Algorithm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“These behaviors tell us that transformers perform simulation by associative scan. Instead of following state changes step-by-step, the models organize them into hierarchies,” says MIT PhD student and CSAIL affiliate Belinda Li SM ’23, a lead author on the paper. “How do we encourage transformers to learn better state tracking? Instead of imposing that these systems form inferences about data in a human-like, sequential way, perhaps we should cater to the approaches they naturally use when tracking state changes.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“One avenue of research has been to expand test-time computing along the depth dimension, rather than the token dimension — by increasing the number of transformer layers rather than the number of chain-of-thought tokens during test-time reasoning,” adds Li. “Our work suggests that this approach would allow transformers to build deeper reasoning trees.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Through the looking glass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Li and her co-authors observed how the Associative and Parity-Associative algorithms worked using tools that allowed them to peer inside the “mind” of language models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;They first used a method called “probing,” which shows what information flows through an AI system. Imagine you could look into a model’s brain to see its thoughts at a specific moment — in a similar way, the technique maps out the system’s mid-experiment predictions about the final arrangement of digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;A tool called “activation patching” was then used to show where the language model processes changes to a situation. It involves meddling with some of the system’s “ideas,” injecting incorrect information into certain parts of the network while keeping other parts constant, and seeing how the system will adjust its predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;These tools revealed when the algorithms would make errors and when the systems “figured out” how to correctly guess the final permutations. They observed that the Associative Algorithm learned faster than the Parity-Associative Algorithm, while also performing better on longer sequences. Li attributes the latter’s difficulties with more elaborate instructions to an over-reliance on heuristics (or rules that allow us to compute a reasonable solution fast) to predict permutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“We’ve found that when language models use a heuristic early on in training, they’ll start to build these tricks into their mechanisms,” says Li. “However, those models tend to generalize worse than ones that don’t rely on heuristics. We found that certain pre-training objectives can deter or encourage these patterns, so in the future, we may look to design techniques that discourage models from picking up bad habits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers note that their experiments were done on small-scale language models fine-tuned on synthetic data, but found the model size had little effect on the results. This suggests that fine-tuning larger language models, like GPT 4.1, would likely yield similar results. The team plans to examine their hypotheses more closely by testing language models of different sizes that haven’t been fine-tuned, evaluating their performance on dynamic real-world tasks such as tracking code and following how stories evolve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harvard University postdoc Keyon Vafa, who was not involved in the paper, says that the researchers’ findings could create opportunities to advance language models. “Many uses of large language models rely on tracking state: anything from providing recipes to writing code to keeping track of details in a conversation,” he says. “This paper makes significant progress in understanding how language models perform these tasks. This progress provides us with interesting insights into what language models are doing and offers promising new strategies for improving them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li wrote the paper with MIT undergraduate student Zifan “Carl” Guo and senior author Jacob Andreas, who is an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and CSAIL principal investigator. Their research was supported, in part, by Open Philanthropy, the MIT Quest for Intelligence, the National Science Foundation, the Clare Boothe Luce Program for Women in STEM, and a Sloan Research Fellowship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers presented their research at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) this week.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/mit-csail-llms.jpg?itok=h_Eov8uW\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers from MIT CSAIL and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science evaluated how closely language models could keep track of objects that change position rapidly.

The United States, for instance, has indefinitely stalled its only long-term underground nuclear waste repository. Scientists are using both modeling and experimental methods to study the effects of underground nuclear waste disposal and ultimately, they hope, build public trust in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from scientists at MIT, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the University of Orléans makes progress in that direction. The study shows that simulations of underground nuclear waste interactions, generated by new, high-performance-computing software, aligned well with experimental results from a research facility in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was co-authored by MIT PhD student Dauren Sarsenbayev and Assistant Professor Haruko Wainwright, along with&amp;nbsp;Christophe Tournassat and&amp;nbsp;Carl Steefel, &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2511885122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These powerful new computational tools, coupled with real-world experiments like those at the Mont Terri research site in Switzerland, help us understand how radionuclides will migrate in coupled underground systems,” says Sarsenbayev, who is first author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope the research will improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research — coupling both computation and experiments — is important to improve our confidence in waste disposal safety assessments,” says Wainwright. “With nuclear energy re-emerging as a key source for tackling climate change and ensuring energy security, it is critical to validate disposal pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing simulations with experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disposing of nuclear waste in deep underground geological formations is currently considered the safest long-term solution for managing high-level radioactive waste. As such, much effort has been put into studying the migration behaviors of radionuclides from nuclear waste within various natural and engineered geological materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1996, the Mont Terri research site in northern Switzerland has served as an important test bed for an international consortium of researchers interested in studying materials like Opalinus clay — a thick, water-tight claystone abundant in the tunneled areas of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is widely regarded as one of the most valuable real-world experiment sites because it provides us with decades of datasets around the interactions of cement and clay, and those are the key materials proposed to be used by countries across the world for engineered barrier systems and geological repositories for nuclear waste,” explains Sarsenbayev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, Sarsenbayev and Wainwright collaborated with co-authors Tournassat and Steefel, who have developed high-performance computing software to improve modeling of interactions between the nuclear waste and both engineered and natural materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, several challenges have limited scientists’ understanding of how nuclear waste reacts with cement-clay barriers. For one thing, the barriers are made up of irregularly mixed materials deep underground. Additionally, the existing class of models commonly used to simulate radionuclide interactions with cement-clay do not take into account electrostatic effects associated with the negatively charged clay minerals in the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tournassat and Steefel’s new software accounts for electrostatic effects, making it the only one that can simulate those interactions in three-dimensional space. The software, called CrunchODiTi, was developed from established software known as CrunchFlow and was most recently updated this year. It is designed to be run on many high-performance computers at once in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers looked at a 13-year-old experiment, with an initial focus on cement-clay rock interactions. Within the last several years, a mix of both negatively and positively charged ions were added to the borehole located near the center of the cement emplaced in the formation. The researchers focused on a 1-centimeter-thick zone between the radionuclides and cement-clay referred to as the “skin.” They compared their experimental results to the software simulation, finding the two datasets aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results are quite significant because previously, these models wouldn’t fit field data very well,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s interesting how fine-scale phenomena at the ‘skin’ between cement and clay, the physical and chemical properties of which changes over time, could be used to reconcile the experimental and simulation data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental results showed the model successfully accounted for electrostatic effects associated with the clay-rich formation and the interaction between materials in Mont Terri over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is all driven by decades of work to understand what happens at these interfaces,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s been hypothesized that there is mineral precipitation and porosity clogging at this interface, and our results strongly suggest that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This application requires millions of degrees of freedom because these multibarrier systems require high resolution and a lot of computational power,” Sarsenbayev says. “This software is really ideal for the Mont Terri experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing waste disposal plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model could now replace older models that have been used to conduct safety and performance assessments of underground geological repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. eventually decides to dispose nuclear waste in a geological repository, then these models could dictate the most appropriate materials to use,” Sarsenbayev says. “For instance, right now clay is considered an appropriate storage material, but salt formations are another potential medium that could be used. These models allow us to see the fate of radionuclides over millennia. We can use them to understand interactions at timespans that vary from months to years to many millions of years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarsenbayev says the model is reasonably accessible to other researchers and that future efforts may focus on the use of machine learning to develop less computationally expensive surrogate models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data from the experiment will be available later this month. The team plans to compare those data to additional simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our collaborators will basically get this block of cement and clay, and they’ll be able to run experiments to determine the exact thickness of the skin along with all of the minerals and processes present at this interface,”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sarsenbayev says. “It’s a huge project and it takes time, but we wanted to share initial data and this software as soon as we could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers hope their study leads to a long-term solution for storing nuclear waste that policymakers and the public can support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interdisciplinary study that includes real world experiments showing we’re able to predict radionuclides’ fate in the subsurface,” Sarsenbayev says. “The motto of MIT’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering is ‘Science. Systems. Society.’ I think this merges all three domains.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-Waste-Storage-01.jpg?itok=lR_HzoIX\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study, co-authored by MIT researchers, aims to improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-power-and-reactors\">Nuclear power and reactors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-security-and-policy\">Nuclear security and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>This “smart coach” helps LLMs switch between text and code</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/smart-coach-helps-llms-switch-between-text-and-code-0717</link>\n  <description>The CodeSteer system could boost large language models’ accuracy when solving complex problems, such as scheduling shipments in a supply chain.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/smart-coach-helps-llms-switch-between-text-and-code-0717</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) excel at using textual reasoning to understand the context of a document and provide a logical answer about its contents. But these same LLMs often struggle to correctly answer even the simplest math problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Textual reasoning is usually a less-than-ideal way to deliberate over computational or algorithmic tasks. While some LLMs can generate code like Python to handle symbolic queries, the models don’t always know when to use code, or what kind of code would work best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs, it seems, may need a coach to steer them toward the best technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;CodeSteer&lt;/a&gt;, a smart assistant developed by MIT researchers that guides an LLM to switch between code and text generation until it correctly answers a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeSteer, itself a smaller LLM, automatically generates a series of prompts to iteratively steer a larger LLM. It reviews the model’s current and previous answers after each round and provides guidance for how it can fix or refine that solution until it deems the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that augmenting a larger LLM with CodeSteer boosted its accuracy on symbolic tasks, like multiplying numbers, playing Sudoku, and stacking blocks, by more than 30 percent. It also enabled less sophisticated models to outperform more advanced models with enhanced reasoning skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advance could improve the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks that are especially difficult to solve with textual reasoning alone, such as generating paths for robots in uncertain environments or scheduling shipments in an international supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a race to develop better and better models that are capable of doing everything, but we’ve taken a complementary approach. Researchers have spent years developing effective technologies and tools to tackle problems in many domains. We want to enable LLMs to select the right tools and methods, and make use of others’ expertise to enhance their own capabilities,” says Chuchu Fan, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics (AeroAstro) and principal investigator in the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan, the senior author of the study, is joined on &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04350\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a paper about the work&lt;/a&gt; by LIDS graduate student Yongchao Chen; AeroAstro graduate student Yilun Hao; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student Yueying Liu; and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab Research Scientist Yang Zhang. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An LLM “trainer”&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask an LLM which number is bigger, 9.11 or 9.9, and it will often give the wrong answer by using textual reasoning. But ask it to use code to answer the same question, and it can generate and execute a Python script to compare the two numbers, easily solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially trained to understand and predict human language, LLMs are more likely to answer queries using text, even when code would be more effective. And while they have learned to generate code through fine-tuning, these models often generate an incorrect or less efficient version of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to retrain a powerful LLM like GPT-4 or Claude to improve these capabilities, the MIT researchers fine-tune a smaller, lightweight LLM to guide a larger model between text and code. Fine-tuning a smaller model doesn’t change the larger LLM, so there is no risk it would undermine the larger model’s other abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also inspired by humans. In sports, a trainer may not be better than the star athlete on the team, but the trainer can still give helpful suggestions to guide the athlete. This steering method works for LLMs, too,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trainer, CodeSteer, works in conjunction with the larger LLM. It first reviews a query and determines whether text or code is suitable for this problem, and which sort of code would be best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it generates a prompt for the larger LLM, telling it to use a coding method or textual reasoning to answer the query. The larger model follows this prompt to answer the query and sends the result back to CodeSteer, which reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is not correct, CodeSteer will continue prompting the LLM to try different things that might fix the problem, such as incorporating a search algorithm or constraint into its Python code, until the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that oftentimes, the larger LLM will try to be lazy and use a shorter, less efficient code that will not carry the correct symbolic calculation. We’ve designed CodeSteer to avoid this phenomenon,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A symbolic checker evaluates the code’s complexity and sends a signal to CodeSteer if it is too simple or inefficient. The researchers also incorporate a self-answer checker into CodeSteer, which prompts the LLM to generate code that calculates the answer to verify it is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling complex tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers designed CodeSteer, they couldn’t find suitable symbolic datasets to fine-tune and test the model, since many existing benchmarks don’t point out whether a certain query could be best solved with text or code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, they gathered a corpus of 37 complex symbolic tasks, including spatial reasoning, mathematics, order reasoning, and optimization, and built their own dataset, called SymBench. They implemented a fine-tuning approach that leverages SymBench to maximize the performance of CodeSteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, CodeSteer outperformed all nine baseline methods they evaluated and boosted average accuracy from 53.3 percent to 86.4 percent. It maintains similar performance even on unseen tasks, and on a variety of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a general-purpose model augmented with CodeSteer can achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models designed to focus on complex reasoning and planning, while requiring much less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method uses an LLM’s own capabilities. By augmenting an LLM with the ability to smartly use coding, we can take a model that is already very strong and improve its performance even more,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to streamline CodeSteer to speed up its iterative prompting process. In addition, they are studying how to effectively fine-tune a unified model with the ability to switch between textual reasoning and code generation, rather than relying on a separate assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors present an elegant solution to the critical challenge of tool utilization in LLMs. This simple yet impactful method enables state-of-the-art LLMs to achieve significant performance improvements without requiring direct fine-tuning,” says Jinsung Yoon, a staff research scientist at Google Cloud AI, who was not involved with this work. “This research represents a substantial contribution that promises to significantly enhance the application of LLMs to a diverse range of tasks with which they currently struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their success in training a smaller, specialized model to strategically guide larger, advanced models is particularly impactful,” adds Chi Wang, a senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind who was not involved with this work. “This intelligent collaboration among diverse AI ‘agents’ paves the way for more robust and versatile applications in complex real-world scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Symbolic-LLMs-01.jpg?itok=ATMqgM63\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">CodeSteer is a smart assistant developed by MIT researchers that guides an LLM to switch between code and text generation until it correctly answers a query.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: Christine Daniloff, MIT; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab\">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Can AI really code?

Recent advances appear to have nudged that future tantalizingly close, but a new paper by researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and several collaborating institutions argues that this potential future reality demands a hard look at present-day challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Titled “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22625\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,” the work maps the many software-engineering tasks beyond code generation, identifies current bottlenecks, and highlights research directions to overcome them, aiming to let humans focus on high-level design while routine work is automated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Everyone is talking about how we don’t need programmers anymore, and there’s all this automation now available,” says Armando Solar‑Lezama, MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science, CSAIL principal investigator, and senior author of the study. “On the one hand, the field has made tremendous progress. We have tools that are way more powerful than any we’ve seen before. But there’s also a long way to go toward really getting the full promise of automation that we would expect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Solar-Lezama argues that popular narratives often shrink software engineering to “the undergrad programming part: someone hands you a spec for a little function and you implement it, or solving LeetCode-style programming interviews.” Real practice is far broader. It includes everyday refactors that polish design, plus sweeping migrations that move millions of lines from COBOL to Java and reshape entire businesses. It requires nonstop testing and analysis — fuzzing, property-based testing, and other methods — to catch concurrency bugs, or patch zero-day flaws. And it involves the maintenance grind: documenting decade-old code, summarizing change histories for new teammates, and reviewing pull requests for style, performance, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Industry-scale code optimization — think re-tuning GPU kernels or the relentless, multi-layered refinements behind Chrome’s V8 engine — remains stubbornly hard to evaluate. Today’s headline metrics were designed for short, self-contained problems, and while multiple-choice tests still dominate natural-language research, they were never the norm in AI-for-code. The field’s de facto yardstick, SWE-Bench, simply asks a model to patch a GitHub issue: useful, but still akin to the “undergrad programming exercise” paradigm. It touches only a few hundred lines of code, risks data leakage from public repositories, and ignores other real-world contexts — AI-assisted refactors, human–AI pair programming, or performance-critical rewrites that span millions of lines. Until benchmarks expand to capture those higher-stakes scenarios, measuring progress — and thus accelerating it — will remain an open challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;If measurement is one obstacle, human‑machine communication is another. First author Alex  Gu, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, sees today’s interaction as “a thin line of communication.” When he asks a system to generate code, he often receives a large, unstructured file and even a set of unit tests, yet those tests tend to be superficial. This gap extends to the AI’s ability to effectively use the wider suite of software engineering tools, from debuggers to static analyzers, that humans rely on for precise control and deeper understanding. “I don’t really have much control over what the model writes,” he says. “Without a channel for the AI to expose its own confidence — ‘this part’s correct … this part, maybe double‑check’ — developers risk blindly trusting hallucinated logic that compiles, but collapses in production. Another critical aspect is having the AI know when to defer to the user for clarification.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Scale compounds these difficulties. Current AI models struggle profoundly with large code bases, often spanning millions of lines. Foundation models learn from public GitHub, but “every company’s code base is kind of different and unique,” Gu says, making proprietary coding conventions and specification requirements fundamentally out of distribution. The result is code that looks plausible yet calls non‑existent functions, violates internal style rules, or fails continuous‑integration pipelines. This often leads to AI-generated code that “hallucinates,” meaning it creates content that looks plausible but doesn’t align with the specific internal conventions, helper functions, or architectural patterns of a given company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Models will also often retrieve incorrectly, because it retrieves code with a similar name (syntax) rather than functionality and logic, which is what a model might need to know how to write the function. “Standard retrieval techniques are very easily fooled by pieces of code that are doing the same thing but look different,” says Solar‑Lezama.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The authors mention that since there is no silver bullet to these issues, they’re calling instead for community‑scale efforts: richer, having data that captures the process of developers writing code (for example, which code developers keep versus throw away, how code gets refactored over time, etc.), shared evaluation suites that measure progress on refactor quality, bug‑fix longevity, and migration correctness; and transparent tooling that lets models expose uncertainty and invite human steering rather than passive acceptance. Gu frames the agenda as a “call to action” for larger open‑source collaborations that no single lab could muster alone. Solar‑Lezama imagines incremental advances—“research results taking bites out of each one of these challenges separately”—that feed back into commercial tools and gradually move AI from autocomplete sidekick toward genuine engineering partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Why does any of this matter? Software already underpins finance, transportation, health care, and the minutiae of daily life, and the human effort required to build and maintain it safely is becoming a bottleneck. An AI that can shoulder the grunt work — and do so without introducing hidden failures — would free developers to focus on creativity, strategy, and ethics” says Gu. “But that future depends on acknowledging that code completion is the easy part; the hard part is everything else. Our goal isn’t to replace programmers. It’s to amplify them. When AI can tackle the tedious and the terrifying, human engineers can finally spend their time on what only humans can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“With so many new works emerging in AI for coding, and the community often chasing the latest trends, it can be hard to step back and reflect on which problems are most important to tackle,” says Baptiste Rozière, an AI scientist at Mistral AI, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “I enjoyed reading this paper because it offers a clear overview of the key tasks and challenges in AI for software engineering. It also outlines promising directions for future research in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Gu and Solar-Lezama wrote the paper with University of California at Berkeley Professor Koushik Sen and PhD students Naman Jain and Manish Shetty, Cornell University Assistant Professor Kevin Ellis and PhD student Wen-Ding Li, Stanford University Assistant Professor Diyi Yang and PhD student Yijia Shao, and incoming Johns Hopkins University assistant professor Ziyang Li.

Their approach allows scientists to efficiently estimate how combinations of treatments will affect a group of units, such as cells, enabling a researcher to perform fewer costly experiments while gathering more accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, to study how interconnected genes affect cancer cell growth, a biologist might need to use a combination of treatments to target multiple genes at once. But because there could be billions of potential combinations for each round of the experiment, choosing a subset of combinations to test might bias the data their experiment generates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the new framework considers the scenario where the user can efficiently design an unbiased experiment by assigning all treatments in parallel, and can control the outcome by adjusting the rate of each treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers theoretically proved a near-optimal strategy in this framework and performed a series of simulations to test it in a multiround experiment. Their method minimized the error rate in each instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique could someday help scientists better understand disease mechanisms and develop new medicines to treat cancer or genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve introduced a concept people can think more about as they study the optimal way to select combinatorial treatments at each round of an experiment. Our hope is this can someday be used to solve biologically relevant questions,” says graduate student Jiaqi Zhang, an Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center Fellow and co-lead author of a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03363\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on this experimental design framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by co-lead author Divya Shyamal, an MIT undergraduate; and senior author Caroline Uhler, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Engineering in EECS and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), who is also director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center and a researcher at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simultaneous treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments can interact with each other in complex ways. For instance, a scientist trying to determine whether a certain gene contributes to a particular disease symptom may have to target several genes simultaneously to study the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, scientists use what are known as combinatorial perturbations, where they apply multiple treatments at once to the same group of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Combinatorial perturbations will give you a high-level network of how different genes interact, which provides an understanding of how a cell functions,” Zhang explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since genetic experiments are costly and time-consuming, the scientist aims to select the best subset of treatment combinations to test, which is a steep challenge due to the huge number of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking a suboptimal subset can generate biased results by focusing only on combinations the user selected in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers approached this problem differently by looking at a probabilistic framework. Instead of focusing on a selected subset, each unit randomly takes up combinations of treatments based on user-specified dosage levels for each treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user sets dosage levels based on the goal of their experiment — perhaps this scientist wants to study the effects of four different drugs on cell growth. The probabilistic approach generates less biased data because it does not restrict the experiment to a predetermined subset of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dosage levels are like probabilities, and each cell receives a random combination of treatments. If the user sets a high dosage, it is more likely most of the cells will take up that treatment. A smaller subset of cells will take up that treatment if the dosage is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From there, the question is how do we design the dosages so that we can estimate the outcomes as accurately as possible? This is where our theory comes in,” Shyamal adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their theoretical framework shows the best way to design these dosages so one can learn the most about the characteristic or trait they are studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After each round of the experiment, the user collects the results and feeds those back into the experimental framework. It will output the ideal dosage strategy for the next round, and so on, actively adapting the strategy over multiple rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimizing dosages, minimizing error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers proved their theoretical approach generates optimal dosages, even when the dosage levels are affected by a limited supply of treatments or when noise in the experimental outcomes varies at each round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simulations, this new approach had the lowest error rate when comparing estimated and actual outcomes of multiround experiments, outperforming two baseline methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to enhance their experimental framework to consider interference between units and the fact that certain treatments can lead to selection bias. They would also like to apply this technique in a real experimental setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a new approach to a very interesting problem that is hard to solve. Now, with this new framework in hand, we can think more about the best way to design experiments for many different applications,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the Advanced Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at MIT, Apple, the National Institutes of Health, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute, and a Simons Investigator Award.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-Combinatoral-Interventions-01-press.jpg?itok=HNOFnzAd\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new experimental design framework could enable scientists to efficiently estimate how combinations of interventions will affect a group of cells, reducing the cost of experiments and providing less biased data that could be used to understand disease mechanisms or develop new treatments.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cells\">Cells</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biology\">Biology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/diagnostics\">Diagnostics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/disease\">Disease</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pharmaceuticals\">Pharmaceuticals</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/genetics\">Genetics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/doe\">Department of Energy (DoE)</category>\n    </item>\n\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n"
