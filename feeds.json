The new systems — <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://ir.appliedmaterials.com/news-releases/news-release-details/applied-materials-unveils-next-gen-chipmaking-products\" target=\"_blank\">Kinex</a>, Xtera, and PROVision 10 — are designed to enable next-generation fabrication methods while also improving performance efficiency and yields of logic and memory semiconductor production nodes and packaging technologies today.</p><p>\"As chips become more complex, Applied is focused on driving materials engineering breakthroughs to provide the performance and power-efficiency improvements needed to scale AI,\" said Dr. Prabu Raja, President of the Semiconductor Products Group at Applied Materials. \"We are collaborating earlier and deeper with our customers to co-develop solutions that accelerate chipmaker roadmaps and enable major device inflections in logic, memory and advanced packaging.\"</p><p>Applied Materials introduced three complementary systems for 2nm-class chip production:</p><ul><li>Kinex, the first integrated die-to-wafer hybrid bonding tool (co-developed with Besi), unites all bonding steps with in-line metrology to form direct Cu-to-Cu interconnects that cut power use and improves yield;</li><li>Centura Xtera, a new epitaxial deposition platform that enables void-free gate-all-around (GAA) transistor's source-drain structures through continuous etch-deposition control, improving uniformity while halving gas consumption;</li><li>PROVision 10, a cold-field-emission eBeam metrology system, which provides sub-nanometer, 10X faster imaging for 3D logic, HBM, and NAND, enabling precise overlay, nanosheet, and void measurements essential for advanced logic and memory manufacturing.</li></ul><p>Let us try to dive a little bit deeper into the each system.</p><h2 id=\"kinex-2\">Kinex</h2><p>The first of the new systems, called Kinex — developed with BE Semiconductor Industries — is the world's first fully integrated die-to-wafer hybrid bonding tool that merges die placement, interconnect formation, and bonding inside a single machine (or a platform, depending on how you consider this unit). Direct copper-to-copper links between chiplets reduces power consumption and increases performance, something that makes the tool particularly relevant for modern and upcoming multi-chiplet solutions featuring 3D integration and perhaps HBM4 memory onboard.</p><p>Applied emphasized that combining all critical bonding steps into one environment reduces contamination and shortens queue times, which in turn shortens a production cycle that is particularly lengthy for 3nm and 2nm-class process technologies. The system also incorporates in-line metrology for real-time overlay control and drift correction to potentially improve yield. As it usually happens with Applied Materials's new tools, several major customers — including logic, memory, and OSAT firms — are already using Kinex for high-volume manufacturing of advanced packages, according to the company.</p><h2 id=\"centura-xtera-2\">Centura Xtera</h2><p>The second product — the Centura Xtera — is an epitaxial deposition platform that creates void-free source-drain structures for gate-all-around (GAA) reansistors. The tool integrates pre-cleaning and etching modules to continuously adjust trench geometry as the material grows to produce more uniform layers across the wafer, which is particularly important for 2nm-class nodes already and will be even more important in the 'angstrom era.'</p><p>According to the company, the Xtera system achieves a 40% improvement in cell-to-cell uniformity while cutting gas consumption by half compared with older epitaxial methods, which is crucial reach their intended speed and efficiency targets without compromising reliability.</p><h2 id=\"provision-10-2\">PROVision 10</h2><p>The third system — PROVision 10 — is a next-generation electron-beam metrology platform designed for 3D logic, HBM, and advanced 3D NAND structures. It employs a cold field emission electron source that increases imaging resolution by 50% and accelerates scanning speed up to 10 times compared with standard thermal systems. The machine can generate sub-nanometer images of buried layers, enabling precise measurement of nanosheet thickness, overlay accuracy, and void formation.</p><h2 id=\"the-china-question-2\">The China question</h2><p>Interestingly, Applied Materials <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/business/tech/semiconductors/applied-materials-says-chipmaking-is-entering-the-atomic-era\">specifically</a> noted that its latest products will not be available to Chinese chipmakers because of U.S. restrictions that bar tools for 14nm-class process technologies and newer to be exported to China. The company estimated that these export limitations would reduce fiscal 2026 revenue by around $600 million, but it can do nothing about it.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/applied-materials-preps-for-angstrom-era-in-chipmaking-spearheaded-by-its-new-kinex-xtera-and-provision-10-systems</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Applied Materials has introduced three new chipmaking systems that are set to mark the beginning of the 'angstrom' and 3D chiplent integration era in chipmaking. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">SzdNDh2MtwL5bMeougF4NG</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnqdtRupVqWHAik43ZWctH-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 16:10:20 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnqdtRupVqWHAik43ZWctH-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Micron]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Micron]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Micron]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vnqdtRupVqWHAik43ZWctH-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Flashforge AD5X review: An affordable option for fast color 3D printing ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Flashforge AD5X is a good 3D printer with a bad slicer experience. I find it somewhat flummoxing, as the machine is using a version of OrcaSlicer, which is widely regarded as an excellent slicer. And yet, the AD5X is hampered with a buggy program that crashes frequently, does not transfer filament types and colors from the device tab to the prepare tab, and worse of all, does not inform the user how much filament is wasted in color swaps.</p><p>These slicer issues could be solved with a software/firmware upgrade, so take this review with a grain of salt. We saw a similar problem with the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/anycubic-kobra-3-review\" target=\"_blank\">Anycubic Kobra 3</a>, and after the slicer problems were fixed, the machine became quite enjoyable to use. I hope that Flashforge takes this to heart and fixes the problem.</p><p>The AD5X is an evolution of the budget model <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/flashforge-adventurer-5m-pro-3d-printer\">Adventurer 5M</a> with an almost identical steel skeleton frame. The enclosure is sold as a DIY Kit that includes clear plastic panels and hardware, while you provide printed parts. This is also a chance for you to upgrade your machine to a fully enclosed one for a small $39 upcharge, which also allows you to give the printer a custom look.</p><p>The AD5X features a quick swap nozzle with a steel insert, which is good up to 300C, and a heated bed that reaches 110C making this an excellent machine for high-temperature filaments (once enclosed).</p><p>The AD5X comes equipped with an IFS, a Flashforge Intelligent Filament System. Unlike a machine with an AMS box, the AD5X has a small box attached to the side of the printer and four regular-sized spool holders. Filament is fed into the box and runs through four Bowden tubes to a color switcher mounted on top of the toolhead. This is rather like the system used by Bambu Lab’s A1 machines, and mechanically, it works very well.</p><p>Retail pricing for the Flashforge AD5X is set at $549, which is pretty decent for an open-frame core XY. The machine is currently on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/FLASHFORGE-Multi-Color-Extruder-Leveling-220x220x220mm/dp/B0DNW25S87?th=1\">sale for $399</a>, which is even better. The machine we reviewed, with the enclosure kit, is $636.96 and on sale for $438. You’ll need to add the price of filament – we got by with one spool, but if you get fancy, this could, of course, go up.

The spool holders are labeled, as are the feeding tubes for the module, but there is only one way to load them that makes sense. With a spool mounted, the filament is inserted into the bottom of the module and pushed in a few inches until the IFS grabs it. This can be a little awkward since the spool holder is spring-loaded to retract a bit.</p><p>Changing filament is simple, since the IFS cuts and retracts the filament when it is done with it.</p><h2 id=\"design-of-the-flashforge-ad5x-2\">Design of the Flashforge AD5X</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"SmmqAXj5QpH7nSqi2HUEtW\" name=\"image12\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SmmqAXj5QpH7nSqi2HUEtW.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flashforge AD5X, with its stripped-down metal frame, lack of lighting, and no camera, is a bare-bones machine by today’s standards. But it does have a well thought-out design with some really nice touches.</p><p>One really nice feature is the large 5015 blower fan mounted in the front tool head cover, which doesn't have any wires to keep it connected to the tool head. When you need to clear a jam or replace a nozzle, you don’t need to deal with the cover dangling by delicate wires while you work. Instead, pins on the front cover connect it to slots on the tool head.</p><p>Replacing the nozzle is simple and requires no tools. The heat break is something I haven’t seen: it's in two pieces and is held together with magnets.</p><p>The motion system is a rock solid, fast, Core XY design driven by two stepper motor concealed behind the back panel. The bed runs on four linear rods and has three lead screws, which are belted together and driven by a single stepper motor. The belt has an automatic tensioner. The bottom of the machine is exposed, so use care when moving it onto a shelf or counter.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"EvgAiSKzh629FR6QkFCLtW\" name=\"image15\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvgAiSKzh629FR6QkFCLtW.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Intelligent Filament System is a small box permanently mounted to the side of the machine, with four spool holders set underneath it.

It also takes some getting used to as it is more of a tap screen than a touch screen, leading you to peck repeatedly at the menus rather than just touching them.</p><p>The things I missed most while using this printer were lighting and a camera. In my well-lit basement, there have been several times I’ve needed to whip out my phone for additional light to see how the first layers are going down. Even on budget printers, I’ve become accustomed to monitoring them remotely with a built-in camera. I did try plugging a webcam into the USB port on the Flashforge’s screen, to no effect.</p><h2 id=\"preparing-files-software-2\">Preparing Files / Software</h2><p>The Flashforge AD5X came with a copy of Orca Slicer dubbed “Orca-Flashforge”. If you are familiar with Orca or Bambu Studio, you should feel right at home. However, having used Orca Slicer and other manufacturers’ skinned versions of Orca Slicer, this is perhaps the least stable version I’ve run across. It crashes about every third print when left up and running. Usually, it will save the file you are working on and ask if you want to reopen it.</p><p>It also has several annoying deficiencies. First, the slicer doesn’t show you the amount of filament wasted in purge volume, only that used in the purge tower. This is unacceptable, as you have no idea how much total filament will be needed to make the print. For example, in these two color frogs, the default purge is 540mm³, which is about .67grams of filament. That’s certainly a small amount, but when multiplied by hundreds of color swaps (and several colors) it can certainly add up.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:628px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:80.89%;\"><img id=\"6LZT2KsodQYurCniZRYDtW\" name=\"image13\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6LZT2KsodQYurCniZRYDtW.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"628\" height=\"508\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another issue is the device tab, which shows the current filaments and their colors in the IFS. You tell the printer what colors you’ve loaded from the touch screen, but this information is not fully transferred to the slicer. It only goes as far as the device tab, then makes you manually enter that information into the slicer itself. This information is critical to flush volumes. If you just wing it, you could end up with black flushing at yellow levels and disastrous results.</p><p>One feature that hopefully Flashforge will remove in a future version of Orca-Flashforge is the nag to clear the build plate before printing a new file.

The good news is that there is a profile for the machine, so you can enjoy a more stable environment.

To fill up that IFS, you’ll want to check out our guide to the<a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-filaments-for-3d-printing\"><u> best filaments for 3D printing</u></a> for suggestions.</p><p>I threw caution to the wind and printed the Flashforge’s enclosure first. There were three plates, and all the models were available as pre-sliced G-code. The AD5X has some <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://wiki.flashforge.com/en/ad5x/Files_for_printed_parts?utm_source=google\"><u>pretty crazy enclosure themes</u></a>, but I decided to go with a basic frame. Since the AD5X does not have active chamber heating, I felt comfortable using the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.flashforge.com/products/pla-cf?variant=41647737274446.\"><u>Volcanic Rock Grey PLA CF</u></a> Flashforge sent for the review. Printed with a .2 layer height and an average speed of 180mm/s, the three plates took a little over 19 hours to print. I’m not sure that the carbon fiber makes the prints stronger, but it does give them a lovely brushed metallic finish.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"ijwCkDqEuQur9jc2V4YjsW\" name=\"image17\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ijwCkDqEuQur9jc2V4YjsW.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you can’t test a multicolor system without doing a ton of multicolor prints. The AD5X does a very good job with color swaps, although it wastes a lot of filament in the process. Even though Flashforge is using Orca Slicer, and you have complete control over flush volume, flush to infill, and can print a purge object, the slicer does not tell you how much material is wasted in the final print. This is very important, as a large amount of wasted material can cause you to unexpectedly run out of filament if you’re not using fresh spools.</p><p>I did a full plate of 33 Articulated Tiny Butt Frogs from Zou3D. Using a .2mm layer height and an average print speed of 200 mm/s, they took 10 hours and 10 minutes to complete. They printed really well using <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pla-simply-green-1kg\"><u>Prusament Simply Green</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-pla-jet-black-1kg\"><u>Prusament Jet Black</u></a> PLA. They also wasted 11 grams of filament in just 23 color swaps around the eyeball. For comparison, one frog only weighs 9 grams.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"Pm5pjDswyeUsbkGsichitW\" name=\"image10\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pm5pjDswyeUsbkGsichitW.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\"><em>Zou3D’s Articulated Tiny Butt Frogs</em> </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For PETG I printed a bunch of vase model Jack-o’-lanterns from Daniel Josvai on Printables.  With a .2 layer height, a whopping .8 layer width, and an average speed of 60 mm/s, the main part of each pumpkin finished in 1 hour and 17 minutes. They printed perfectly in <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/translucent-orange-mh-build-series-petg-filament-175mm-1kg/sk/M-DDH-HJVW\"><u>Matter Hackers Build Series translucent orange</u></a>. The pumpkin tops needed infill and were printed separately in the same PETG translucent orange.</p><p>All the stems and all the faces printed in about an hour each, with a .2 layer height at an average of 100mm/s. The stems were printed in <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-petg-jungle-green-1kg\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Jungle Green Prusament PETG,</u></a> and the faces printed in <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.prusa3d.com/product/prusament-petg-jet-black-1kg/\" target=\"_blank\"><u>Jet Black Prusament PETG</u></a>. Unfortunately, since this wasn’t a true multicolor print, I had to use <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.3dgloop.com/shop\"><u>3D Gloop to stick the pieces together</u></a>, and got a little messy on one of the smallest smiles.</p><p>This print came out extremely smooth, without any stingingness you often get from PETG.

This special low-density PLA is ‘Pre-foamed” when it is manufactured, making it perfect for printing RC plane parts. I’ve tried printing this one Thingiverse model, the Nucking Futs, several times. The Flashforge AD5X is the first printer I’ve used that can print Lightweight PLA without making a stringy mess or failing halfway through. Using the stock PLA profile and bumping the retraction up to 2mm, I got amazingly smooth prints with just the tiniest bit of fuzz.</p><p>The RC plane is a very delicate, tall, and slender model that requires excellent bed adhesion and a steady motion system. Using a .2 mm layer height with only one wall, no infil,l and a print speed slowed to a maximum of 75mm/s, the prints averaged 3 hours and 30 minutes each. Due to the size of this model, the plane is broken into a dozen pieces, then glued together. The wings have 8 pieces that print in pairs. After being Glooped together, the complete wing (without servos) is only 139 grams using Polymaker <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://us.polymaker.com/products/polylite-lw-pla?variant=40603758559289\"><u>LW-PLA in yellow</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://us.polymaker.com/products/polylite-lw-pla?variant=41590536994873\"><u>red</u></a>.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  mosaic-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"j3L9DSLfXsnbNTjfpdJgwW\" name=\"image5\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j3L9DSLfXsnbNTjfpdJgwW.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"caption-text\">The Nucking Futs, by tahustvedt </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"k4s5MY5vQ9vDoUHfDgzPpW\" name=\"image1\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k4s5MY5vQ9vDoUHfDgzPpW.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Close up of the Nucking Futs’ tail, which is printed extremely thin.  </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1999px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"UkkeEWCyN6zQkSJgq4zkqW\" name=\"image7\" alt=\"Flashforge AD5X\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkkeEWCyN6zQkSJgq4zkqW.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Another close up of the wing to show print quality.

Sapphire originally priced the Nitro+ at $729, but it never actually sold at that rate; just three months ago, it hit its lowest price ever of $769, so this course correction has long been due. As for the GPU itself, it doesn't really need a sales pitch.

It has 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM, which is plenty for today and tomorrow, and this Nitro+ model boosts up to 3,060 MHz while staying extremely quiet. You also get a single recessed 12V-2x6 connector for power, which allows for easy and elegant cable routing. Sapphire has included a magnetic backplate, too, which is made out of metal, so it feels really high-quality, and there's an RGB header present on-board as well for lighting sync.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review/9\" target=\"_blank\">In our review</a>, we praised the card for its superior value proposition, but knocked a few points for Nvidia's comparatively stronger driver suite. If creature comforts like RTX HDR, multi-frame gen and Nvidia Broadcast don't really matter to you, AMD's offering is a clear winner, especially now that power consumption for multi-monitor setups has been fixed, and the card in general has a modest TDP of 330W. We haven't even mentioned FSR 4, which has worked extensively to close the gap with DLSS and only looks to get better with Redstone.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/sapphire-radeon-rx-9070-xt-drops-to-usd729-the-best-all-around-graphics-card-for-enthusiasts-from-amds-best-partner-is-at-an-all-time-low-on-amazon</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ AMD's RX 9070 XT is our top choice for a GPU in 2025, and arguably its best variant, the Sapphire Nitro+ has just hit its all time-low price on Amazon.

While ‘The Cube’ wasn’t a commercial success, it shaped the future of personal computing in several ways.</p><p>An event at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco was chosen for the unveiling of The Cube. Contemporary reports suggest this theatrical setting was used because one of the crowd-pleasing demos of the NeXT Computer highlighted its built-in DSP, which can be a boon to computer audio processing, among other things. During the staged gala event, The Cube even ‘played a duet’ with a professional violinist.</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/92NNyd3m79I\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This big NeXT reveal came just three years after the most famous Apple cofounder was ousted from the Cupertino company, in the wake of a power struggle with the board. Despite the relatively short gap, the NeXT Computer made some significant strides. However, typical for Jobs, NeXT didn’t shy away from premium pricing, and the $5,600 ticket on this will have dampened excitement. Inflation adjusted, The Cube would cost over $15,000 today…</p><h2 id=\"it-s-great-to-be-back-2\">\"It's great to be back.”</h2><p>So, we’ve already mentioned the built-in DSP, but what other silicon throbbed inside the 1ft x 1ft x 1ft die-cast magnesium chassis?</p><p>Like Apple Macs of the era, The Cube used a Motorola 680X0 main processor, the 68030 in this instance. It came with the 68882 floating-point coprocessor, and ran at 25 MHz. These computers shipped with 8MB of RAM as standard, expandable to 64MB via four available SIMM slots. For storage, the NeXT Computer came with a 256MB magneto-optical drive (an optical rewritable format), and there was an optional 330MB or 660MB hard disk to configure.</p><p>Supporting this interesting array of hardware was the NeXTSTEP operating system. This was “based on the Mach microkernel and BSD-derived Unix, with a proprietary GUI using a Display PostScript-based back end,” says a Wikipedia <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT_Computer\">entry</a>.</p><p>Of course, many already know that Jobs’ NeXT business was basically a side-quest of his Apple career, as he would return with Apple’s acquisition of NeXT in December 1996, and reclaim the Cupertino throne to become Apple’s de facto leader within a year.</p><h2 id=\"next-machines-used-for-the-development-of-the-www-and-doom-2\">NeXT machines used for the development of the WWW and Doom</h2><p>Beyond its artfully modern styling, advanced hardware for the era, and Unix-based OS, the NeXT Computer was famously used by Tim Berners-Lee to create the first web server and browser, laying the foundation for the Internet as we know it today.

According to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/china-reacts-trump-100-tariffs-threat-10866180\"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, China is ready to face Washington’s ultimatums, urging it to resolve the issue at the negotiating table instead of making statements on social media.</p><p>“If the U.S. persists in acting unilaterally, China will resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China said in a statement. “Our position on a tariff war remains consistent — we do not want one, but we are not afraid of one.”</p><p>The current trade war with China kicked off in April of this year, when Trump pushed tariffs on all the U.S.’s trade partners, including a 54% total tariff on Chinese goods. It responded to this with counter-tariffs of its own, plus restrictions on some rare-earth exports that <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-global-chipmaking-supply-chains\">threaten global chipmaking supply chains</a>. Things have seemingly settled down in the past months as both parties negotiated over trade, but China’s recent expansion of rare-earth controls <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/chinas-new-rare-earth-curbs-hit-14nm-and-256-layer-chipmaking\">threatens advanced semiconductors up to 14nm</a>, which were first released in 2014.</p><p>China is the leading supplier of rare-earth minerals, with the country supplying 70% of the raw materials needed to produce them and 90% of the processing capability across the globe. Because of this, it can potentially strangle the global chip-making supply chain, especially as many companies that make chips are based in the U.S. or in countries that are closely aligned with it.</p><p>Interestingly, China used the same language that the U.S. used to block exports to the country in its rare-earth export controls, saying that the restrictions are meant to “safeguard national security” and prevent their use by foreign militaries. However, you can also see that it’s using this as a bargaining chip, as Beijing has previously shown in July 2025, when it eased some of the restrictions in exchange for Washington <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/white-house-lifts-chip-design-export-ban-on-china-in-exchange-for-rare-earth-materials-compromise-export-licences-for-eda-software-sales-no-longer-required\">lifting the export ban on EDA software</a>.</p><p>Trump said on his social media platform that he will put the tariff into effect on November 1, meaning the U.S. and China still have some time to talk things through. China likely enacted the expansion of its rare-earth export controls to get something out of the U.S. in negotiations, but we will only know this if it lifts or reduces restrictions after getting a concession from the White House.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-says-it-is-not-afraid-of-a-trade-war-in-response-to-us-100-percent-tariffs-threat</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ China said that it's ready to face Trump's 100% tariffs. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">8obx5Wnha2bLrK6tnHb4P</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rD24zGiC8EYStp2huyMizK-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 14:09:26 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Jowi Morales) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jowi Morales ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rD24zGiC8EYStp2huyMizK-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Shutterstock]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Chess pieces on Chinese and US flag]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Chess pieces on Chinese and US flag]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rD24zGiC8EYStp2huyMizK-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Researchers achieve breakthrough integration of 2D materials on standard silicon chips ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>For the first time, scientists have successfully built a fully functional memory chip using two-dimensional materials and integrated it directly onto a conventional silicon die — a milestone that could change how future semiconductors are made. The research, led by Chunsen Liu and colleagues at Fudan University in Shanghai, was published on October 9 in the journal <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09621-8\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nature</em></a>.</p><p>The research may mark a turning point for 2D electronics, which have long promised atomic-scale performance and efficiency but struggled to move beyond lab demonstrations. Using a process the team calls ATOM2CHIP, the researchers grew a layer of molybdenum disulfide just a few atoms thick directly on top of a conventional 0.13-micrometer CMOS silicon chip. The result is a hybrid chip that combines a 2D NOR flash memory array with a standard CMOS controller, effectively bridging the gap between experimental nanomaterials and industry-standard fabrication.</p><p>The Fudan team reports a 94.34% yield from full-chip testing — a figure that rivals commercial silicon production — and operational speeds up to five megahertz. Each bit consumes just 0.644 picojoules, far below the energy draw of today’s silicon flash cells. The memory demonstrated fast 20-nanosecond programming and erasing, ten-year data retention, and endurance of over 100,000 write cycles.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1752px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:101.71%;\"><img id=\"y4QAwxfH97RjwTdAmxCKoS\" name=\"Researchers achieve breakthrough integration of 2D materials on standard silicon chips\" alt=\"A full-featured 2D flash memory chip using ATOM2CHIP technology.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y4QAwxfH97RjwTdAmxCKoS.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1752\" height=\"1782\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">A full-featured 2D flash memory chip using ATOM2CHIP technology. </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Nature)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To achieve this, the researchers had to overcome the challenge of surface roughness. Silicon chips, even after polishing, have uneven terrain at the nanometer scale that can tear or stress atomic-thin layers. The ATOM2CHIP method introduced a conformal adhesion process that allows the 2D material to “flow” over the contours of the underlying circuits without breaking, while a 2D-friendly packaging system guards against heat and electrostatic damage.</p><p>Equally crucial was the team’s “cross-platform system design,” a custom interface ensuring the 2D layer could communicate seamlessly with the CMOS control logic. This design enables instruction-driven operations, 32-bit parallelism, and random access, or, in other words, a full-featured memory chip.</p><p>In their paper, the authors describe the result as “an important milestone in extending the superiority of 2D electronics to real-world applications.” The implications go well beyond flash storage. If scaled, such hybrid architectures could drastically reduce power use and increase density in next-generation processors and AI processors, effectively continuing Moore’s Law at the atomic limit. While mass production is still years away, this is the closest 2D materials have come to commercial relevance.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/researchers-achieve-breakthrough-integration-of-2d-materials-on-silicon-chips</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Researchers at Fudan University have created a working memory chip just a few atoms thick, and the first to integrate 2D materials with standard silicon circuits. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">x86iPszMR5PsifJK3F7irG</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZooNVerTPyhBVzTBAksJS4-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 13:36:31 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Luke James ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZooNVerTPyhBVzTBAksJS4-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZooNVerTPyhBVzTBAksJS4-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Taiwan says its chip fabs are safe from China’s rare-earth crackdown ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs says the island’s chip sector will see “no significant impact” from China’s newly expanded rare-earth export controls, in comments <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/taiwan-says-doesnt-need-china-most-its-rare-earths-needs-2025-10-12/\" target=\"_blank\">first reported by <em>Reuters</em></a><em> </em>on October 12. Those reassuring words come just days after Beijing added a fresh batch of heavy rare earths to its licensing regime — including holmium, erbium, thulium, europium, and ytterbium — and widened the scope to cover associated materials and processing tech.</p><p>Officials in Taipei were quick to note that these specific metals aren’t used by TSMC in wafer production, and that Taiwan already sources most of its rare-earth derivatives from allies in Europe, Japan, and the United States.</p><p>But while fabs like TSMC may not rely on holmium or thulium, rare-earth elements remain deeply embedded in the wider tech stack, particularly in high-performance magnets. That’s where the ripple effects could begin to show, even if the core fab process escapes unscathed.</p><p>The new rules, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-expands-rare-earth-export-controls\">which took effect on October 9</a>, are part of an ongoing campaign to tighten China’s grip on rare-earth supply chains. Beijing’s Ministry of Commerce said the controls are designed to safeguard national security and interests, but the language mirrors past moves aimed at weaponizing materials dominance in retaliation for U.S. export restrictions.</p><p>Unlike previous rounds of restrictions that focused on neodymium and dysprosium, this wave targets elements with niche but strategic uses. Europium, for instance, is still used in some high-efficiency display phosphors. Others, like ytterbium, play a role in specialty lasers and cooling systems.</p><p>More importantly, the new licensing rules can apply not just to raw exports, but to any derivative products or technical documentation, and to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/chinas-new-rare-earth-curbs-hit-14nm-and-256-layer-chipmaking\">any end use flagged as sensitive</a>. That includes AI chips, quantum tech, and advanced defense hardware. And while China says licenses will still be granted, the added paperwork and discretionary enforcement slow things down.</p><p>Taiwan’s economic ministry isn’t wrong to downplay the threat to semiconductor front-ends. But the PC space runs on more than silicon. Hard drives, for example, depend on voice-coil actuators and spindle motors built around high-performance magnets. Those magnets often rely on heavy rare-earth dopants to retain coercivity at elevated temperatures. The more China turns the screws on exports, the more likely it is that HDD and component vendors begin feeling the squeeze.</p><p>So, while there’s no immediate sign that fabs in Taiwan will suffer under this specific round of Chinese export controls, China doesn’t need to hit chipmakers directly to shake up supply chains. As licensing delays accumulate and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/china-launches-port-crackdown-on-nvidia-chips\">enforcement expands</a>, friction will continue to build downstream.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/taiwan-says-its-fabs-are-safe-from-china-rare-earth-crackdown</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Taiwan’s Ministry of Economic Affairs says the island’s chip sector will see 'no significant impact' from China’s newly expanded rare-earth export controls. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">Yh9jrdKpgReCEr4DQsdWLP</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4eZrCtk8yyPbygdoere4cc-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 12:40:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Luke James ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4eZrCtk8yyPbygdoere4cc-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[TSMC]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[TSMC]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[TSMC]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4eZrCtk8yyPbygdoere4cc-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Apple doubles security bounty to $2 million, with bonuses potentially increasing rewards to $5 million. ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple announced at Hexacon 2025, the top global offensive security conference, that it will double its highest security bounty to $2 million. This makes Cupertino the most generous company that offers an award for unearthing vulnerabilities, and it’s even offering top-up bonuses that can see security experts earning more than $5 million for uncovering exploits. According to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/apple-security-bounty-evolved/\">Apple’s Security Research blog</a>, it has already awarded over $35 million to more than 800 security researchers since 2020, bringing the average award to $43,750. It even claimed that multiple individuals have received $500,000 in rewards.</p><p>The top $2-million award is reserved for those who discover sophisticated exploit chains similar to what mercenary spyware attacks exploit. Beyond that, there’s also a bonus system for those who can break Apple’s Lockdown Mode secure environment and vulnerabilities in its beta software, bringing the potential payout to over $5 million. There are also smaller awards, like $1 million for those who can crack broad iCloud security and those who can create a wireless proximity attack using radio, up to $300,000 to anyone who develops a one-click WebKit sandbox escape mechanism, and $100,000 to those who can bypass Gatekeeper on macOS.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1280px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"dkF5ccf9kFXC7FvdBKuXei\" name=\"Apple doubles security bounty to $2m\" alt=\"bug bounty program launch and current max payout\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dkF5ccf9kFXC7FvdBKuXei.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t the only bug bounty program anyone can participate in. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/amd-willing-to-pay-you-up-to-dollar30k-via-its-new-bug-bounty-program\">AMD announced its own program</a> last year, with a payout of up to $30,000, while Intel offers a maximum of $100,000.

And last, but not least, Google began its Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) in 2010. The search giant’s rewards vary from a few hundred dollars to a million dollars for the most serious vulnerabilities on its Titan M security chip. The company paid $11.8 million in 2024 to 660 researchers, bringing the average award to $17,800 per head.</p><p>These awards can make finding bugs a lucrative field, especially for talented security researchers. And while it might seem like an expensive proposition for companies, it’s far cheaper for them to pay out these bounties instead of having a bad actor discover it and disseminate it under their noses, resulting in reputational and financial damages for the corporation. Moreover, software mistakes can potentially cost lives, as state actors and other third parties are increasingly using sophisticated means to target specific personalities.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/apple-doubles-security-bounty-to-usd2-million-with-bonuses-potentially-increasing-rewards-to-usd5-million</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Apple has announced that it will double its bug bounty cap to $2 million. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">fpih6Ns59jMfUtDd7YJ8GV</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpzTKxu8gNjKb7xphDZ8NS-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 12:20:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Cybersecurity]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Jowi Morales) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jowi Morales ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpzTKxu8gNjKb7xphDZ8NS-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tom&#039;s Hardware]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Apple Mac Studio (Early 2025)]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Apple Mac Studio (Early 2025)]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jpzTKxu8gNjKb7xphDZ8NS-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 review: A 96-percent magnetic switch keyboard with a semi-customizable LCD screen ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Mechanical keyboards have become more popular than ever, thanks to TikTok for typing ASMR videos and the support for said peripherals on gaming consoles such as the Xbox and PlayStation 5. That said, there are so many boards featuring different switches, case materials — heck, even cables. But right now, one of the hottest commodities in the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/gaming-keyboards/best-gaming-keyboards\"><u>best gaming keyboards</u></a> is the magnetic switch. Companies have been battling for the best Hall Effect keyboard on the market since magnetic switches have become more popular.</p><p>Today, we have the new Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 - a 96-percent mechanical keyboard with Hall Effect switches and, most notably, an LCD screen. This isn’t the first time Corsair has used magnetic switches — a couple of years ago, I reviewed their <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-k70-max-rgb\"><u>K70 Max RGB</u></a> and was pleased, overall. However, it's been a couple of years, so it's time to see if this new board is worth a look.</p><h2 id=\"specs-2\">Specs</h2><div ><table><tbody><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Switches</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Corsair MGX Hyperdrive Linear</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Lighting</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Per-key RGB</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Onboard Storage</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Yes, 5 profiles</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Media Keys</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Connectivity </strong></p></td><td  ><p>USB Type A</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Cable</strong></p></td><td  ><p>6-feet, braided</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Additional Ports</strong></p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Keycaps</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Double-shot PBT</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Software</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Web Hub</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Dimensions (LxWxH)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>388*141*43 mm / 5.28 × 5.55 × 1.69 inch </p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Weight </strong></p></td><td  ><p>2.2 lbs</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>MSRP / Price at time of release</strong></p></td><td  ><p>$230</p></td></tr><tr><td class=\"firstcol \" ><p><strong>Release Date</strong></p></td><td  ><p>September 25 2025</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id=\"design-of-the-vanguard-pro-96-2\">Design of the Vanguard Pro 96</h2><p>The Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 is one of Corsair’s many mechanical keyboards, sporting their MGX Hyperdrive Linear switches, Axon hyper-processing technology and a new LCD screen in a 96-percent form factor.

The screen is vibrant and configurable, but it wasn't what I expected when I opened the box. Because we’ve grown accustomed to seeing screens on everything from power supplies to all-in-one liquid coolers, I was surprised to see this screen wasn’t as customizable as I thought it would be. According to Corsair, you can use the screen to display custom animations, images, system specs, and more. However, I could only get photos to display. I did not see an option to display my system specs or custom animations in Corsair's Web Hub.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1353px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:37.77%;\"><img id=\"rCw6LYptzDG7UQM9buYgHG\" name=\"image1\" alt=\"Corsair Vanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rCw6LYptzDG7UQM9buYgHG.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1353\" height=\"511\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the support for gifs is neat, you need to make sure they’re below 500 KB; if they're larger, you'll see a frustrating notice.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:408px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:29.90%;\"><img id=\"3s2ipsvVZxf7huCaym7aBG\" name=\"image5\" alt=\"Corsair Vanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3s2ipsvVZxf7huCaym7aBG.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"408\" height=\"122\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tried about five or so different gifs and could not find one under that size, so I ended up sticking with photos (and I was able to upload a couple of different ones). Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed by the screen. That said, I did receive my review model before release, so Corsair might still be working on improving Web Hub’s compatibility with the Vanguard Pro 96.</p><p>The Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 also has a new feature that allows you to control your Elgato Stream Deck with the keyboard. Next to the FN key on the Vanguard Pro 96, there's a key that resembles the Elgato logo. If you press that key, you can then toggle between different Elgato Stream Deck functions, such as mute, record, etc. Don’t worry — if you’re like me, and do not own a Steam Deck, accidentally pressing the key will not change anything. You can also disable it or remap it.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3893px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"qba27qjbhNHuqnuNiofTqF\" name=\"IMG_4266\" alt=\"CorsairVanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qba27qjbhNHuqnuNiofTqF.jpg\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3893\" height=\"2190\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1503px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.07%;\"><img id=\"aVR77fur3TUCxVgGLY3UPH\" name=\"image4\" alt=\"Corsair Vanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aVR77fur3TUCxVgGLY3UPH.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1503\" height=\"1504\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Corsair)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The build quality of the Vanguard Pro 96 is pretty solid. While it is almost entirely plastic, it seems pretty robust, and like it can handle the occasional drop or fist slam during bits of rage in-game. The board sounds good too — inside, you’ll find multiple layers of sound-damping foam to eliminate case and spring ping.</p><p>While the Vanguard Pro 96 has a couple of new features, you’re still getting Corsair's AXON technology, which provides you with a polling rate of 8,000 Hz, 20 layers of on-board lighting effects that can be configured, and a keystroke range from 0.1mm to 4mm — which is on par with other high-end magnetic gaming keyboards.</p><p>The keycaps are made of double-shot PBT plastic, which is thick and durable and also allows the RGB lighting to shine through. On the left side of the Vanguard Pro 96 are five dedicated macro keys — something I haven’t seen in years. As mechanical keyboards have become more feature-packed, companies have moved away from dedicated macro keys — so I love this. Beside the five macro keys is a gaming mode key, which turns the polling rate down to 1,000 Hz, turns WinLock on, and switches the backlighting to red. This isn’t a new feature, but it's worth pointing out, for any competitive gamers out there.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3795px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"FwDgLsNXg5fxmv6hnEN4uF\" name=\"IMG_4265\" alt=\"CorsairVanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FwDgLsNXg5fxmv6hnEN4uF.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3795\" height=\"2135\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/corsair-k70-core-rgb\"><u>Corsair K70 Core RGB</u></a>, I was surprised by how smooth the switches were out of the box — and I can confirm the MGX Hyperdrive linear switches in the Vanguard Pro 96 are even better than their non-magnetic counterparts. But I'll go into more detail on the switches later in the review.</p><h2 id=\"typing-and-gaming-experience-on-the-vanguard-pro-96-2\">Typing and Gaming Experience on the Vanguard Pro 96</h2><p>The Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 arrived in the midst of my <em>Battlefield 4</em> reboot. Thanks to Microsoft locking me out of my old Xbox account, I'd lost all of my progression, so I had to start at level one on <em>Battlefield 4</em>. The keyboard worked very well for gaming. I didn’t experience any latency issues and I even adjusted the actuation points on keys 1-5 to 1mm so I could swap weapons/gear with less force.</p><p>The Vanguard Pro 96 is also a convenient keyboard for everyday use, as it includes a 10-key numberpad. I am a massive advocate for numberpads; I have been using the same Filco Majestouch numberpad for over three years, and I can’t work without it. I will say that since the Vanguard Pro 96 is a 96-percent board, and not a full-size board, it took me a little while to get comfortable with the numberpad as it's a smaller keyboard overall..</p><p>The keyboard comes with Corsair’s MGX Hyperdrive linear switches, and I love them. While I was really impressed by Corsair Reds in the K70 Core RGB, you do lose out on the Hall Effect / magnetic switch capabilities with those. Also, the bottom-out isn’t as harsh on the magnetic switches, and the switches are quieter overall. One of the things I dislike about Hall-effect switches is their sound. Because the switches have magnets in them, they can be pretty loud, but the MGX switches sound like any other Cherry clone — which was great and very tolerable.</p><p>Keep in mind, I’m only scratching the surface when it comes to this keyboard’s capabilities. The AXON technology, dedicated macro keys, and rotary knob are absolutely worth experimenting with if you are a true gamer or want to set macros to make your day-to-day processes simpler. Like all gaming keyboards, the Vanguard Pro 96's strength is in its customizability.</p><h2 id=\"software-of-the-vanguard-pro-96-2\">Software of the Vanguard Pro 96</h2><p>Unlike the K70 Core RGB, the Vanguard Pro 96 is powered by Corsair’s online Web Hub.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1720px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:73.90%;\"><img id=\"rFbgVa6h5p7g9tFDhCo9WG\" name=\"image7\" alt=\"Corsair Vanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rFbgVa6h5p7g9tFDhCo9WG.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1720\" height=\"1271\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the name suggests, Web Hub is an online-only software — and I’m not a fan of the idea. I had no issues with iCUE, and I genuinely do not understand why Corsair thought it would be a good idea to make an online-only configuration software for a keyboard as customizable as this one. What if you’re traveling and want to fine-tune the actuation on your WASD keys and don’t have access to WiFi? It seems like an inconvenience to require an internet connection to adjust the keyboard's settings.</p><p>Fortunately, Web Hub works fine. I didn’t have any issues with it, but if you buy this keyboard, be sure to update the USB Wired Polling Rate to 8,000 Hz in the device settings because the board will arrive with its polling rate set at 1,000 Hz.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:690px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:92.46%;\"><img id=\"3NhC7h6HtCEJ8Q7R9cq6EG\" name=\"image2\" alt=\"Corsair Vanguard Pro 96\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NhC7h6HtCEJ8Q7R9cq6EG.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"690\" height=\"638\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"bottom-line-7\">Bottom Line </h2><p>I really like the Corsair Vanguard Pro 96 overall. While I’m kind of annoyed by the online-only configuration tool, the keyboard makes up for it — it sounds great, and the switches are fast, feel good, and aren't too loud. I was a bit disappointed by the lack of visual capabilities of the built-in LCD screen (while it’s nice to have a picture of my dog, Daphne, on my keyboard... it's not necessarily the most useful feature).</p><p>While I like this keyboard, I'm not sure it's worth $230. Sure, the screen, customizability, and generous support for your Stream Deck is cool — but I don’t think it’s $230 cool.

Those adrenaline-pumping feats of engineering, harmonizing cutting-edge hardware and software to push the boundaries of physics. A lot of people, though, are equally enthusiastic about PCs and how they contribute to the world of racing. After all, a car is technically just a computer on wheels, so why not combine the two to birth something truly unique that honors both cultures?</p><p>That's exactly what Nvidia did, in its latest episode of GeForce Garage, where it partnered up with modder <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.j-custom.com/portfolio\" target=\"_blank\">JCustom</a> (Justin Chu) to fit an entire gaming PC inside a wheel of a Porsche 911. The build also has a real key fob to turn it on or restart it, wirelessly.</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-08FZa6yoU\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Our journey begins with an HRE FF21 wheel (not acually Porsche, we know) that alone starts at $750 and that's before the custom paint job on top. See, this rig is being built for someone very special that we'll reveal at the end; they have a Porsche 911 Turbo S in the Python Green colorway, so our modder Justin decided to color-match the entire build to that. That meant power-coating the sides (barrel) of the wheel to be the same green, and even updating the silver to resemble what Porsche uses from factory.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"svX5Gk4u45pAffFRBMLyga\" name=\"QcK XL Control (33)\" alt=\"Porsche Wheel PC from JCustom & GeForce Garage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/svX5Gk4u45pAffFRBMLyga.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: GeForce Garage)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The main PC is placed right behind the spokes and appears like it's floating because the custom-built motherboard tray is mounted directly to the wheel's barrel, with the help of some tabs that extend into the tray. You can see how that looks in the next set of pictures after this. The end-result is flawless, but achieving such elegance was only possible after Justin put the wheel inside CAD to iron out all the details and create the necessary parts himself.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"ND6bq428jEnX7shyqsp3PS\" name=\"QcK XL Control (34)\" alt=\"Porsche Wheel PC from JCustom & GeForce Garage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ND6bq428jEnX7shyqsp3PS.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: GeForce Garage)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of, the motherboard tray is what houses most of the cabling as it's actually quite thick — from the pictures, we can estimate ~3 inches. The tray is suspended from four sides via metal beams that provide rigidity, and to advance this magical appearance, Justin used a back-connect motherboard. This way all the wires would conveniently route through this tray compartment, and the motherboard assembly itself would be the only thing visible on the outside.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"K59CnG5ZXk6rvDRjpJeWPX\" name=\"GeForce Garage - Porsche Wheel PC for Michael Rainey Jr. 2-37 screenshot\" alt=\"Porsche Wheel PC from JCustom & GeForce Garage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K59CnG5ZXk6rvDRjpJeWPX.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: GeForce Garage)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"JrdZMH5TeLYY49jAsAY5YX\" name=\"GeForce Garage - Porsche Wheel PC for Michael Rainey Jr. 2-57 screenshot\" alt=\"Porsche Wheel PC from JCustom & GeForce Garage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JrdZMH5TeLYY49jAsAY5YX.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: GeForce Garage)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"inlinegallery-item\" style=\"flex: 0 0 auto;\"><span class=\"slidecount\">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class=\"van-image-figure \" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3840px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"iHch33hMnXDj25xHtxQ7oX\" name=\"GeForce Garage - Porsche Wheel PC for Michael Rainey Jr. 2-54 screenshot\" alt=\"Porsche Wheel PC from JCustom & GeForce Garage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHch33hMnXDj25xHtxQ7oX.png\" mos=\"\" link=\"\" align=\"\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\"\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: GeForce Garage)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The tray includes an SFF power supply, too, and sleeved PCIe cables for the GPU, which is a Founder's Edition RTX 5080.

You can check out the full specs of the PC in the table at the end to see what else he paired up with this GPU.

The soft malleable HydroHaptic sensor is a natural fit for a deformable <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-wireless-mouse\">computer mouse</a>, gaming, or wearables, reckon the development team.

Users can touch, tap, twist, or pinch this to invoke a range of input expressions. “Input from the user is sensed by the system through the object and the user then feels the system’s haptic response through the deformable surface,” explained Professor Jason Alexander, the HydroHaptics research lead at Bath.</p><h2 id=\"expressive-tactile-input-devices-with-good-feedback-2\">Expressive, tactile input devices with good feedback</h2><p>HydroHaptics was first showcased at the recent ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology. A paper published to coincide with the event won an honorable mention award. Central to the soft deformable and tactile proposition were a series of four real-world use-cases, as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Computer mouse:</strong> At the current time, the computer mouse concept takes the form of the protruding soft silicone dome you see in the top image. Tests with this device saw users sculpting digital objects on screen. Meanwhile, \"dynamic feedback simulated the material’s stiffness and guided the sculpting process,\" explains the Bath University blog.</li><li><strong>Joystick:</strong> The scientists created a small deformable 3D joystick with HydroHaptics. According to their findings, players enjoyed using this input method which was capable of simulating resistance, tension, or sharp impacts. Of course, it also capably covers the basics of directional input.</li><li><strong>Backpack:</strong> Simple but intuitive, this use-case envisions backpack straps with built-in feedback to deliver smart device notifications. A compelling use case is where navigation tools send taps to your shoulder to indicate an upcoming turn. Using this, you can keep your smart device sheathed, and hands free.</li><li><strong>Cushion:</strong> The scientists also reckon a cushion with a HydroHaptic pouch inserted could be a simple and intuitive way to control smart home devices, like TVs, heating, lighting, and so on.</li></ul><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1400px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:34.29%;\"><img id=\"MBQAN5rcnuyuPUSmitZsdB\" name=\"squish-tech\" alt=\"HydroHaptic technology\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBQAN5rcnuyuPUSmitZsdB.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1400\" height=\"480\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Tech needs to be miniaturized </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: University of Bath)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"how-hydrohaptics-works-2\">How HydroHaptics works</h2><p>The scientists and researchers behind this project claim to be the first to have delivered \"high-fidelity haptic output through a deformable surface without  compromising the surface’s softness, flexibility, or input richness.\" Behind HydroHaptics, as presented by the Bath-led team, is a compact motor and seal liquid-filled soft silicone chamber. The particular \"resolution, precision and scale demonstrated by HydroHaptics,\" are said to make it stand apart from prior efforts.</p><p>According to the scientists, HydroHaptics could be market ready in the near future (between one and two years) if investment is forthcoming. However, they admit that the underlying haptic engine could benefit from some refinement, and the mechanism from miniaturization.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/controllers-gamepads/new-hydrohaptic-technology-could-have-you-squeezing-pinching-and-twisting-a-pliable-mouse-or-joystick</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Computer scientists have revealed an innovative, expressive, two-way input peripheral technology dubbed HydroHaptics. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">aBrZNNzLoBpQUP3ktyQGmH</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cvixvtRcRJ3QX2hmuADrdB-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 11:20:00 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Controllers and Gamepads]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Peripherals]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Mark Tyson ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cvixvtRcRJ3QX2hmuADrdB-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[University of Bath]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[HydroHaptic technology]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[HydroHaptic technology]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cvixvtRcRJ3QX2hmuADrdB-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ AI datacenters in the US aren't 'running on coal' — but this dirty fuel has found favor for feeding demand spikes due to increased gas prices ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>U.S. datacenters are increasingly relying on coal-fired electricity as expanding AI infrastructure drives up power needs and makes natural gas less affordable, reports <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/datacenter_coal_power/\">The Register</a>. However, in states with nuclear power plants, coal, slate, and oil are used to smooth peaks and lows of power, not to address the needs of prominent tech giants. Let us try to figure it out.</p><h2 id=\"training-2\">Training</h2><p>A report from Jefferies shows coal generation rising nearly 20% and there are projections that it will stay high through 2027. The combination of fast-growing electricity demand and unfavorable gas prices has pushed operators to revive the use of the dirtiest fuel in the mix. But it is not only about the waste, it is about a power grid that has to be available to everyone.</p><p>A nuclear power plant is almost perfectly suited to supply a mass of power to an AI training datacenter because its steady, high-capacity output matches the data center’s continuous and predictable demand profile. Well, almost. During a training run, checkpoint intervals — when models are saved to storage — cause a major drop in GPU utilization as data is written and synchronized, these fluctuations are minor compared with the total load.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the nuclear plant's generation does not vary, so grid operators must compensate for sudden drops or spikes of usage, which is where coal and renewables come into play. Without them, the power flows steadily through high-voltage lines to transformers, which are meant to maintain stable voltage in homes and industry, but are not to handle massive loads.</p><p>In essence, nuclear energy provides the power that keeps multi-week training runs uninterrupted, but when the cards are down, coal and renewables do their job for the other consumers.</p><h2 id=\"inference-2\">Inference</h2><p>Things are different for inference, a stage where a trained model is put to use, generating outputs from new inputs rather than learning from data. AI inference consumes power in short, intense bursts as the system processes large chunks of forward computations at unpredictable intervals.</p><p>Each request — whether it is generating text, recognizing an image, or serving a recommendation — triggers thousands of matrix multiplications across AI accelerators, drawing a surge of electricity for a fraction of a second. When millions of requests arrive simultaneously, the combined load can climb sharply, stressing both the local power distribution and the cooling systems. Inference creates spiky, rapidly fluctuating power patterns that must be met with responsive grid supply or on-site energy storage. The power grid has to be rigid enough to support all types of customers, which is again where renewables and coal or slate come in.</p><p>As AI datacenters drive up U.S. electricity demand, coal generation has surged nearly 20%, according to Jefferies cited by <em>The Register</em>, though the role of coal is mostly to stabilize the grid rather than directly power AI clusters.</p><h2 id=\"summary-2\">Summary</h2><p>Nuclear plants provide the steady output ideal for multi-week AI training runs, while coal and renewables help balance fluctuations caused by checkpoints and other loads. During inference, when millions of user requests arrive unpredictably, the grid relies on flexible sources — including fossil fuels — to handle the short, sharp bursts of power demand that even advanced datacenters can’t smooth alone.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-datacenters-in-the-us-arent-running-on-coal-but-this-dirty-fuel-has-found-favor-for-feeding-demand-spikes-due-to-increased-gas-prices</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ AI datacenters are driving up U.S. power demand and boosting coal generation by nearly 20%, but while nuclear plants supply the steady output needed for long training runs, coal and renewables mainly serve to stabilize the grid and absorb the sharp, unpredictable power spikes from AI workloads. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">CYj6N5ZMDdugnM7X628bwg</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n4uucZP4dV7mmuFv43MWGE-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 11:01:41 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n4uucZP4dV7mmuFv43MWGE-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Google]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n4uucZP4dV7mmuFv43MWGE-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Save $80 off this humongous, enterprise-class hard drive — WD Gold 14TB HDD on clearance sale, just 1.7 cents per gigabyte ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Even though SSDs have taken over as the primary choice for storage in desktop and mobile devices, hard drives are still the most sensible option when it comes to mass storage.

These are meant for data center and enterprise use cases, but they can still fit nicely in a NAS or for any other archival duty. While you don't get the OptiNAND cache functionality in the 14 TB variant, there's still 512 MB of cache onboard. Being a SATA III drive, you get up to 262 MB/s  transfer rates with the motor spinning at 7200 RPM. WD's HelioSeal tech allows for low power draw as well, which makes this quite efficient. All of that is backed up by a 5 year warranty for further peace of mind.</p><div class=\"inlinegallery  carousel-layout\"><div class=\"inlinegallery-wrap\" style=\"display:flex; flex-flow:row

the 22TB variant</a>, the drive tested fairly well. We noted how it sits largely in the middle of the stack across benchmarks and performs competently. It can be the perfect drive for surveillance use at this price point, given the sheer amount of storage you get here. Furthermore, it has a 2.5 million hours MTBF rating and a workload rate limit (WRL) of 550TB per year, which is expected for a server drive. Sustained read/write speeds, along with random read/write speeds are all par for the course for such a large drive.

The library holds more than 150 floppy disks across its collections, including items from the Stephen Hawking archive, early research drafts, personal files, and software written for now-defunct machines.</p><p>The main challenge is that magnetic coatings degrade over time, and even when floppy disks are still in good condition, the drives needed to read them are vanishing. That’s where Future Nostalgia comes in.</p><p>Led by the library’s digital preservation team, the project aims to document and formalize best practices for floppy disk recovery, encompassing cleaning and handling methods, as well as imaging workloads. It’s also pulling in expertise from the retro-computing community, whose trial-and-error techniques are often the only reason legacy formats still survive.</p><p>You can forget those cheap USB floppy drives you can buy online. Cambridge’s preservationists don’t just mount disks and hope for the best; they sample the raw magnetic signal itself. Specialized hardware, such as the KryoFlux and open-hardware Greaseweazle interfaces, captures the flux transitions — the tiny changes in polarity that encode data — and reconstructs the file structure later in software. This flux-level imaging process enables archivists to recover non-PC formats and identify weak or damaged sectors that would otherwise remain unread.</p><p>The project has already drawn wider attention. Earlier this week, the BBC’s <em>Future</em> section ran a feature on Cambridge’s work, framing it as part of a global effort to rescue knowledge trapped on obsolete media. The piece followed visitors as they handed over floppy disks containing forgotten family archives and decades-old research, underscoring how much personal and historical data now resides on disks that few machines can even read.</p><p>Even when data is successfully extracted, archivists face a second battle of deciphering long-abandoned file types and proprietary word processors. That’s why Future Nostalgia is also looking to create a repeatable, transparent workflow that other institutions can adopt as the passage of time renders more disks unrecoverable by the day.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/cambridge-university-rescues-data-from-old-floppy-disks</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ On October 9, Cambridge University Library opened its doors to anyone with an old floppy disk and a question: What’s on here? ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">HyTx5tqMM6gsV496JP3xUU</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8i4Qk3G2v8jW94TXdfyXCm-1280-80.png\" type=\"image/png\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 18:05:05 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Storage]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[PC Components]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Luke James ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/png\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8i4Qk3G2v8jW94TXdfyXCm-1280-80.png\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Cambridge University Library]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[A smiling woman with her arms folded sits at a table scattered with floppy disks. ]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[A smiling woman with her arms folded sits at a table scattered with floppy disks. ]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8i4Qk3G2v8jW94TXdfyXCm-1280-80.png\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Nintendo allegedly hacked by Crimson Collective hacking group  — screenshot shows leaked folders, production assets, developer files, and backups ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A high-profile hacking group called Crimson Collective claimed that it had successfully hacked Nintendo, which is notorious for being litigious and overprotective of its intellectual property. Cybersecurity intelligence firm Hackmanac shared a screenshot on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://x.com/H4ckmanac/status/1976895206273220758\">X</a> that allegedly showed proof of the attack, with folders that seemingly stored Nintendo data, including production assets, developer files, and backups. However, the Japanese gaming giant is yet to make a statement about this attack, so we’re unsure if this is real or just a made-up screenshot.</p><p>Crimson Collective is the group behind the recent attack on Red Hat, during which it gained unauthorized access to the company’s GitHub repositories and stole about 570GB of data. The group then attempted to extort the company but was simply dismissed. Red Hat eventually confirmed the breach, opting to work with the authorities to pursue the attackers and collaborating with its affected clients to rectify the issue.</p><p>If this attack on Nintendo is legitimate and perpetrated by the same party, then it’s likely they are attempting the same tactic of contacting the gaming giant through official channels and asking for payment to delete the stolen data, or else they will leak it.</p><div class=\"see-more see-more--clipped\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet hawk-ignore\" data-lang=\"en\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">🚨Cyber Alert ‼️🇯🇵 Japan - NintendoCrimson Collective hacking group, known for the breach on Red Hat, now claims to have breached Nintendo.Discover more at https://t.co/kJbN062Yq3 pic.twitter.com/ip8qkhrWuS<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1976895206273220758\">October 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class=\"see-more__filter\"></div></div><p>This isn’t the first time that hackers have attacked a gaming company. Rockstar was previously targeted by an attack in 2023, and some of the source code for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> was leaked online. In the same year, Insomniac Games, the studio behind several Spider-Man titles, was hit by a ransomware attack, and files related to games and employees were made available for download on the internet. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/cdpr-cyberattack-ransom\">CD Projekt Red was also a victim in 2021</a>, after the source codes for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and several other titles, along with several different files, were stolen and threatened to be released publicly if the company did not pay.</p><p>Despite all the noise, Nintendo is known for keeping its secrets. Unless customer or personal data has been targeted or leaked, where it’s required by law to notify the public of an attack, it’s unlikely that the company will disclose any details of this breach. So, without confirmation from the makers of the Switch 2, we can only guess if Crimson Collective’s exploit is true or not.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/nintendo-allegedly-hacked-by-crimson-collective-hacking-group-screenshot-shows-leaked-folders-production-assets-developer-files-and-backups</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ The Crimson Collective hacking group claims to have breached Nintendo's security and stolen files from the gaming company. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">EpC4jPDwpuvf3aqDJwgt4Q</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jicsBbmavzfiGuLrA5RDSS-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:11:25 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Cybersecurity]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Jowi Morales) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jowi Morales ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jicsBbmavzfiGuLrA5RDSS-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tom&#039;s Hardware]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 playing Mario Kart World]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 playing Mario Kart World]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jicsBbmavzfiGuLrA5RDSS-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Battlefield 6 has an epic launch bug where it fails to recognize that the game is already installed — EA boss suggests one affected player to ‘refund and buy on Steam’ ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Battlefield 6 is shaping up to be <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-peaks-at-747-000-concurrent-players-newly-launched-game-ranks-among-the-top-three-most-played-on-steam-today\">one of the biggest AAA game launches</a> this year, but the game’s opening day is far from perfect.

The issues, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-25-949/\">reported October 7</a> by Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI), affect multiple builds of the popular open-source compression tool and were quietly fixed in July.</p><p>Tracked as CVE-2025-11001 and CVE-2025-11002, the flaws stem from how 7-Zip parses symbolic links within ZIP files. In essence, a crafted archive can escape its intended extraction directory and write files to other locations on the system. When chained, this can escalate to full code execution under the same privileges as the user, which is enough to compromise a Windows environment. Both vulnerabilities carry a CVSS base score of 7.0.</p><p>According to ZDI’s advisory, exploitation requires user interaction, but that bar is low; simply opening or extracting a malicious archive is sufficient. From there, the symlink traversal flaw can overwrite or plant payloads in sensitive paths, allowing the attacker to hijack execution flow. ZDI categorizes both bugs as directory traversal leading to remote code execution in a service account context.</p><p>7-Zip’s developer, Igor Pavlov, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/7-zip-for-windows-goes-massively-parallel-with-first-threadripper-edition-five-years-after-threadripper-debut-version-25-00-the-first-to-support-more-than-64-threads\">released version 25.00 on July 5</a>, which patched the vulnerabilities alongside several smaller issues in RAR and COM archive handling—the current stable build, 25.01, followed in August. However, public disclosure of the security details didn’t occur until this week when ZDI’s advisories went live. That means users who haven’t updated since early summer have remained vulnerable for months without being aware of it.</p><p>The lack of an automatic update mechanism compounds issues like this. 7-Zip must be updated manually, and many users rely on older portable versions. Even in enterprise settings, it often escapes patch management systems because it isn’t installed via Windows Installer or a central repository.</p><p>Earlier this year, CVE-2025-0411 made headlines for allowing attackers to bypass Windows’ Mark-of-the-Web protections by nesting malicious ZIPs, effectively stripping downloaded files of their “from the internet” warning flags.

Because of this, some e-commerce stores have imposed <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/usd320-camera-lens-buyers-hit-with-usd2-000-delivery-fee-in-tariffs-fight-some-sellers-implement-exorbitant-shipping-costs-to-dissuade-us-customers\">exorbitant delivery fees</a> to deter American customers. However, those who have continued to ship to the U.S. are now facing a new challenge: thousands of packages have been getting stuck in UPS hubs across the United States, as reported by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/ups-delay-customs-tariffs-packages-destroyed-rcna236607?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAAwXB2w6CIAAA0L%2FpLXW67LK1xjRbprai0nxhQigqIoGLnvr2zmHTJPXGtgUmghptVVJavBW9nYmgeH%2BaOy%2FwrsaEt6%2Ft0ZQFc3CTsTJ3gvS2B%2BC65Ochho5M1iiL5jLqYtDCWk1JjEKe%2By8GUwhJp13Hi0l3MF%2B9OKFVQs%2BMA1TRAV0SEJLQ11p77vPRr4oo910z%2BylaU6Va0SCsRqOp2kYVoXgc%2Bz8Kw2duswAAAA%3D%3D&fbclid=IwZnRzaANWX2NleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHuU6YlLSkv380X6kWMkCJJ-u0sn8OVbp2FIxJJyOzbTclyMbDGzkr_wt46GU_aem_QLADcD6sss32YVk8XFW62w&_branch_match_id=1473812339559653531\"><em>NBC News</em></a>.</p><p>The primary reason for these delays is the missing information, according to the company. “Because of changes to U.S. import regulations, we are seeing many packages that are unable to clear customs due to missing or incomplete information about the shipment required for customs clearance,” the company told <em>NBC</em>. Unfortunately, UPS cannot hold packages in limbo indefinitely. It said that it attempts to contact the shippers three times to complete the data that U.S. customs requires. If the company is unable to reach the shipper, it’s left with two choices.</p><p>“First, the package can be returned to the original shipper at their expense. Second, if the customer does not respond and the package cannot be cleared for delivery, disposing of the shipment is in compliance with U.S. customs regulations,” the company said. “We continue to work to bridge the gap of understanding tied to the new requirements, and, as always, remain committed to serving our customers.”</p><p>However, all this confusion has already started to affect customers. There have already been multiple instances of items getting disposed of after failing to clear customs. Conflicting notifications compound this: one customer reported that their package was destroyed by UPS as per customs guidelines after failing clearance, only to receive a message three days later stating that their item is on the way. However, a day after that, they received another update stating the same message: that their item had not cleared customs and was discarded.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://investors.ups.com/sec-filings/annual-filings\" target=\"_blank\">2023 annual report, UPS stated</a> that it handled 3.2 million international shipments daily. While it claims to clear more than 90% of the packages it handles on the first day through customs, that means the remaining 10% encounter some issue. This is potentially a huge number given the scale of its operation, amounting to thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of delayed items.</p><p>There haven’t been widespread reports of this issue from customers of other shipping services, such as FedEx and DHL, so we’re unsure whether it is an issue with customs or with the company. However, all this kerfuffle will definitely be a problem for customers who paid for an item, only to have it destroyed at the border because of documentation issues.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/ups-reportedly-destroying-packages-due-to-customs-confusion-thousands-of-parcels-per-day-are-seemingly-affected-by-delays-due-to-documentation-issues</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ UPS is experiencing issues with thousands of parcels due to incomplete information, resulting in customs delays and, in some cases, item destruction. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">GWAVBgo9qv2cYqYd6cwce</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPbw7E9wmGqPGt6u9kRozc-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 13:33:16 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Jowi Morales) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jowi Morales ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPbw7E9wmGqPGt6u9kRozc-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Izyan Sultanali / Unsplash]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[UPS planes on an airport ramp]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[UPS planes on an airport ramp]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPbw7E9wmGqPGt6u9kRozc-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ AmeraLabs introduces elastic 3D printing resin with long-lasting squish — a full bottle is priced at $140 ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Flexible resins have a problem: printed pieces tend to harden over time, sometimes within just a few weeks. AmeraLabs, a European-based resin manufacturer, claims to have solved the problem.</p><p>\"Most flexible resins are a compromise – they start soft but gradually harden over weeks or months,\" said Andrius Darulis, co-founder of AmeraLabs, in a press release. \"We developed FLX-300 to maintain its properties over time. This opens up real engineering applications, not just temporary prototypes.\"</p><p>FLX-300 features an exceptionally low compression set, enabling printed parts to reliably spring back to their original shape after repeated deformation. AmeraLabs’ internal testing showed no measurable change after three months of aging, making it suitable for long-term use in engineering and functional applications.</p><p>The flexible resin is currently available for sale on the AmeraLabs website for €120 per 1KG bottle. That’s approximately $140 USD for a whole bottle, compared to $89 for AmeraLabs’ high-resolution TGM-7 resin, which is used for standard models. AmeraLabs requests that US customers shop their <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/F719D801-1EFB-42A4-A07F-2480B63E70E2?ingress=0&visitId=7a1fd419-1a7a-47ec-a5d4-dac7a9a88f77\">Amazon site due to customs laws,</a> but the material is not yet in stock.</p><p>The material is only available in black and is ideal for printable gaskets, vibration dampers, and custom pieces that are expected to compress and spring back repeatedly. FLX-300 is reported to have low shrinkage, which contributes to its high dimensional accuracy. After post-curing, the material has a silky-smooth silicone feel.</p><p>AmeraLabs states that the new material also resists water absorption, maintaining stability in humid conditions, and cures to a non-tacky finish under standard UV light. It is compatible with a wide range of MSLA and DLP 3D printers, including those from Anycubic, Phrozen, Elegoo, Asiga, Epax, Longer, and Prusa. AmeraLabs cautions users not to employ PDMS-based resin trays, as the material is highly reactive and can damage silicone layers. The company recommends using fluoropolymer films such as FEP, PFA, or ACF instead.</p><p>For best results, AmeraLabs advises heating the resin to at least 25°C before printing and using slower lift speeds with well-braced supports. Because FLX-300 has a higher viscosity than standard resins, printed parts should not be left soaking in IPA or other solvents for more than 30 minutes.</p><p>FLX-300 resin is not skin safe and should not be used for close contact with the human body or for any medical purpose. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://ameralabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FLX-300.pdf\">Technical data

with a 100% tariff and critical software ban — major escalation retaliates for China's rare earth restrictions ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on China-made goods in retaliation for <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/chinas-new-rare-earth-curbs-hit-14nm-and-256-layer-chipmaking\">unprecedented export controls on rare earth materials</a>, he actually did so, increasing import tariffs on Chinese goods to 100% starting November 1. In addition, the U.S. will impose export controls on 'critical software,' something that may be more crippling than the tariffs.</p><h2 id=\"a-100-tariff-2\">A 100% tariff</h2><p>\"Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,\" Trump wrote over at <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115351840469973590\">Truth Social</a>. \"Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.\"</p><p>China's new policy requires companies to obtain government approval before exporting any product containing more than 0.1% of rare earths that originate from or are processed in the country. The list of materials includes seven rare-earth families, including samarium, terbium, dysprosium, and lutetium, as well as their magnet and sputtering-target forms. Assuming that the list is accurate, China <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-global-chipmaking-supply-chains\">expands its 'Tier 3' restrictions introduced this April</a>, which means no critical hit to foundation materials, but <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-expands-rare-earth-export-controls\">precisely crippling hits</a> along the way of devices and industries worldwide.</p><p>Given that the lion's share of the global rare earth supply is under China's control, the export control decision has raised alarms in multiple sectors, including automotive, consumer electronics, and chip manufacturing. How exactly this could hurt the industries is something that remains to be seen, but China's plan to impose additional control globally is already evident.</p><h2 id=\"critical-software-2\">Critical software</h2><p>In response, the U.S. will not only double tariffs (which is set to hit American businesses first), but also introduce export restrictions on 'critical software,' which is perhaps the most crippling sanction. The U.S. government does not define what 'critical software' is, which leaves the door open to misunderstanding. So, let us speculate.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/white-house-lifts-chip-design-export-ban-on-china-in-exchange-for-rare-earth-materials-compromise-export-licences-for-eda-software-sales-no-longer-required\">the Trump administration restricted shipments of chip design and simulation tools to China</a> while the president was negotiating with the Chinese leader. That helped resolve some of the fundamental issues with rare-earth exports from China and made life easier for Cadence and Synopsys.</p><p>What happens if the Trump administration broadens the definition of 'critical software' beyond EDA tools? The following targets are likely to include AI development frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX, as well as distributed-training software that enables large-scale model training on advanced accelerators. Limiting access to this software would directly constrain China's ability to develop advanced AI systems, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/singapore-company-alleged-to-have-helped-china-get-usd2-billion-worth-of-nvidia-ai-processors-report-claims-nvidia-denies-that-the-accused-has-any-china-ties-but-a-u-s-investigation-is-underway\" target=\"_blank\">even if it manages to procure the necessary </a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/singapore-company-alleged-to-have-helped-china-get-usd2-billion-worth-of-nvidia-ai-processors-report-claims-nvidia-denies-that-the-accused-has-any-china-ties-but-a-u-s-investigation-is-underway\">hardware</a>.</p><p>Another area likely to come under scrutiny is compilers, firmware, and embedded software that control the operation of hardware. This includes CPU and GPU microcode, as well as FPGA configuration tools, which could potentially harm American and European companies with production operations in China, but will also impact Chinese companies.</p><p>Controls could also reach manufacturing and infrastructure software, which will include everything from network management (unless already replaced by modern, closed-source Linux from a China-based company) to wafer fab equipment (WFE) tools that tend to run customized versions of Linux and Windows. It will not collapse them overnight, but will introduce a new set of operational difficulties.</p><p>Then again, without a precise definition, this is all speculation.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/trump-strikes-back-at-china-with-a-100-percent-tariff-and-critical-software-ban-major-escalation-retaliates-for-chinas-rare-earth-restrictions</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ President Trump imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese goods and announced export controls on undefined 'critical software,' a move that could cripple China’s tech and manufacturing sectors more than tariffs themselves. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">kiUFaeSqS8cTy2LQoEvPxf</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UygtZowxYgbcyDJtKt6u2Z-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 12:52:29 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Semiconductors]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Manufacturing]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UygtZowxYgbcyDJtKt6u2Z-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[The White House]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[The White House]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[The White House]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UygtZowxYgbcyDJtKt6u2Z-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ I was ‘forced’ to update to Windows 11, and it wasn’t as bad as I thought — How to upgrade from Windows 10 to Windows 11 without tearing your hair out ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The big day is nearly upon us, and whether you like it or not, you need to take action!

But today we have a story that will melt your heart, or at least make you a little envious. Redditor <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1o2h8pc/recently_in_china_a_girl_gave_her_fianc%C3%A9_an_rtx/\">Zestyclose-Salad-290</a> shared a wedding video on social media on Friday, which focuses on a young couple’s exchange of gifts on their special day. As you can see, the wife surprised the husband with a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review\">GeForce RTX 5090</a>, one of the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html\">best graphics cards</a> available in 2025. The husband presented his new wife with a delicately pretty bouquet.</p><p>From the husband’s point of view, starting his new married life, beginning with the gift of an Asus ROG Astral RTX 5090 from his beloved, has definitely begun well. Many commenters on the Reddit post chip in with how lucky they think the groom is.</p><p>An interesting aspect of this RTX 5090 gift, which elevates it above a story about an extravagant tech gift, lies in the way that the bride revealed it. She used a quite elaborate form of ‘Chinese number slang’ which required a bit of work from the groom, to understand the true nature of his gift.</p><blockquote class=\"reddit-card\"  ><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1o2h8pc/recently_in_china_a_girl_gave_her_fianc%c3%a9_an_rtx\">Recently in China, a girl gave her fiancé an RTX 5090 at their wedding. Context and translation are given in the comment.</a> from <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace\">r/pcmasterrace</a></blockquote><script async src=\"//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js\" charset=\"UTF-8\"></script><p>Zestyclose-Salad-290 sought to help those unfamiliar with number slang understand the meaning of the complex-looking equation. These random-looking numbers, to the uninitiated, have Chinese homophone meanings. The key point here is that 520 is a slang term for ‘I love you’ as both the spoken number and phrase sound very similar to native speakers.</p><p>Sometimes, speakers extend the phrase to '1314,' which translates to 'for a lifetime.' Therefore, 5201314 ultimately signifies 'I love you for a lifetime.'</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1066px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:34.43%;\"><img id=\"cgikxoWQZusyhLCmnqXwTg\" name=\"special-numbers\" alt=\"RTX 5090 wedding gift\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgikxoWQZusyhLCmnqXwTg.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1066\" height=\"367\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1o2h8pc/recently_in_china_a_girl_gave_her_fianc%C3%A9_an_rtx/\" target=\"_blank\">Zestyclose-Salad-290</a>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>“First, the girl kept her husband in suspense and asked him to solve a fairly complex calculation: 520×10 + 1,314 - 514 - 619 + 666 – 957,” explains Zesty. “The result of this calculation is exactly 5090. When her husband worked out the answer, the girls beside her took the 5090 out.”</p><p>So, the message started emphatically with 520x10. Or ‘I love you’ x 10. 1314 is significant as it is a homophone for ‘forever and always.’ Elsewhere in the tricky sum, we see 514 (til death), 619 (escaping forever), 666 (awesome), and 957 (I’m teasing).</p><p>The answer to this numerical riddle is, of course, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-review\">5090</a>, a number which all regular readers will understand as representing awesome graphics, with the chance of a surprise <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidias-rtx-5090-power-cables-may-be-doomed-to-burn\">burning</a> smell.

The FBI conducted a sting operation that caught Andrew Scott Hastings, 25, in its net. Hastings apparently showed no scruples in his willingness to supply these parts to an undercover FBI agent who claimed to be an al-Qaida operative. This is an interesting case, brought to light by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/tulsa-man-charged-with-attempting-to-supply-3d-printed-weapons-to-al-qaida-contact-245090/\" target=\"_blank\">3D Printing Industry</a> news, as it pits cherished freedom of speech and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hobbyists-push-back-against-3d-printer-crackdowns\">gun rights</a> against the need to protect the public from terrorist atrocities.</p><p>The formal charge that Hastings faces is “attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and for the illegal possession and transfer of a machine-gun,” according to the publication.</p><h2 id=\"tip-of-the-iceberg-2\">Tip of the iceberg</h2><p>Hastings put himself on the FBI's radar as an unscrupulous individual who promoted violence in support of global jihad through his online presence and participation in various forum discussions.</p><p>Dealing in <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/3d-printing-companies-turn-to-ai-to-block-production-of-ghost-guns-we-spoke-with-thingiverse-about-its-new-ai-driven-ghost-gun-detection-strategy\">3D printed gun</a> parts was the tip of the iceberg, though, as far as Hastings’ willingness to help enemies of the U.S. went. As well as home-made gun components, the Oklahoman was happy to share “over 500 pages of personal notes and Army manuals on weapons manufacturing and military tactics,” says 3D Printing Industry. He was also allegedly interested in creating nuclear weapons, using drones, wielding cyberattacks, evading law enforcement, as well as the use of tunneling strategies made popular by the likes of Hamas.</p><p>It might be surprising to hear that Hastings once served in the U.S. Army National Guard (as an aircraft powertrain repairer). The source says he allegedly traveled abroad without reporting his trip, which is a no-no given his military position. Moreover, it is reported that Hastings voluntarily discharged from the Guard on June 6, 2025, which was during the course of this investigation.</p><h2 id=\"caught-red-handed-2\">Caught red-handed?</h2><p>As indicated in the intro, the FBI managed to cozy up to Hastings via an undercover agent who claimed to have al-Qaida links. As a result of the contact, the accused purportedly provided a link to a website offering 3D-printed machine-gun conversion parts. Subsequent recorded footage showed Hastings fulfilling these orders. Specifically, packages containing over 100 of these <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-3d-printers\">3D printed parts</a>, as well as handgun parts, and sundry terrorist-friendly bits and pieces were posted by Hastings.</p><p>The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force's involvement in the investigation, we note that there was support and involvement from the Army Counterintelligence Command, ATF, and Tulsa Police Department.</p><p>Hastings has made an initial court appearance in relation to the federal charges, which were unsealed in late September. We don't have an official trial date for the charges at the time of writing, and we don't know Hastings' plea.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/oklahoma-man-charged-with-supplying-over-one-hundred-3d-printed-machine-gun-conversion-kits-to-a-person-he-thought-was-an-al-qaida-operative-suspect-allegedly-shipped-a-range-of-firearms-parts-intended-for-terrorist-attacks</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ A resident of Tulsa, Oklahoma is facing a potential 20 years in prison, for supplying another individual hundreds of 3D printed gun components. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">YzE27RWoXak57nkWfQnRni</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKGgvCzPF88SLmgj2GHmPV-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 12:19:51 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[3D Printing]]></category>\n                                                                                                                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Mark Tyson ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKGgvCzPF88SLmgj2GHmPV-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tom&#039;s Hardware]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[3D Printed Harlot Gun]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[3D Printed Harlot Gun]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKGgvCzPF88SLmgj2GHmPV-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen Review: The Next Generation ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen may sound like the title of a badly-translated 1990s Saturday morning manga, but in reality it is the updated version of the flagship Secretlab Titan Evo 2022 that we <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/secretlab-titan-evo-2022-review-superior-gaming-chair\"><u>reviewed</u></a> back in 2021.</p><p>The $799  Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen sports a hybrid leatherette that feels soft to the touch, but that the company claims has enhanced UV and stain resistance. Under the leatherette there is a nanofoam composite — essentially multiple layers of foam designed to provide support and comfort.</p><p>The Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen comes in two sizes. Regular, for persons between 5'7\" and 6'2\" (170 - 188cm) weighing less than 220lbs (100kg), and XL for those between 5'11\" and 6'9\" (180 - 206cm) and between 175 and 395lbs (79 - 179kg). Both sizes come in your choice of either pure white or pure black NanoGen leatherette.</p><p>Is the next generation Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen better than what came before it?

My <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Mechanical/dp/B0BLMQ8BXB\"><u>HOTO Electric screwdriver</u></a> has been in constant use! All of this practice prepared me well to assemble the Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen Edition.</p><p>The box the chair came in was extremely large, measuring 28.3 x 33.5 x 15 inches (72 x 85 x 38cm), and weighing 78 pounds (35.5kg) — it was challenging to move. The delivery person even offered to help me, but pride took over and I said I was okay — and I was (barely). Let's just say the box has a two-person lift icon for a reason!</p><p>The assembly guide states that two people should assemble the chair, but you can do it with one person. I assembled the chair in 37 minutes using the provided tools — but there were a few sweaty moments.</p><p>Inside the box is a glorious amount of exceptionally dense packing foam (which I will be reusing), a manual, a quick reference card, and a pack of leather wipes. The manual was exceptionally clear to follow, and the quick reference card helped me fully understand the unboxing process. The chair comes with all the tools you'll need to assemble it, including a T-handle with an embedded magnet to hold the bit, and two bits: an M8 hex driver and a Pozi screwdriver. (You can use other ¼ inch bits with the handle, but shorter bits will need an extension piece or they'll get lost in the handle.) The handle will prove useful around the house and office when I need a little more torque. This included tool was the only tool I used to assemble this chair — unlike when I assembled my previous <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/boulies-master-chair-review-double-duty\"><u>Boulies Master chair</u></a>, which required my Wera hex drivers to attach the base of the chair to a frame. The SecretLab Titan Evo NanoGen already had this section connected to its chair base, which made for an easier assembly process.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"Se4Bs6Kb2XcqB9ksukn7hk\" name=\"design8\" alt=\"Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Se4Bs6Kb2XcqB9ksukn7hk.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While building the chair, one area where I hit an issue was when I needed to slide the backrest onto the base. My unit had come with the guiding rails slightly out of line, meaning that I could not push the back onto the seat without moving them. One of the rails is freely moved, while the other is kept under tension via a huge coiled spring. The manual advises that you should not release this rail without the chair back on — but I needed to.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"34mddXp5uqzbVAnLmJuFfk\" name=\"lock\" alt=\"Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34mddXp5uqzbVAnLmJuFfk.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I opened the plastic cover, and slowly released the retaining safety screw (the orange plastic piece in the image) and, with my hands well clear of any moving parts, pressed the release. The loudest metallic “CLACK” sound reverberated around my home, causing my wife to shout, asking if I was ok — I was, and so were my hands. The sound was the rail moving forward at very high speed, and if my hand <em>had</em> been in the way, I would have ended up in the ER with half a chair attached to me. Don’t do that, dear reader — I had to, but you shouldn’t.</p><p>Other than that minor hiccup, assembly was smooth and I soon had the chair upright and ready for testing.</p><h2

room, and second, it is much easier to photograph. But pure white furniture dulls and loses its clarity over time. UV rays from sunlight and stains will quickly turn bright white into an off-white. Secretlab, however, claims that this chair will stay bright white — even in a sunny room. Without subjecting it to an all-day session in a tanning salon and/or throwing a jar of turmeric over it, I have to take those claims with a pinch of salt. The leatherette material is easier to clean than fabric, and the included wipes will certainly be on standby, as I am clumsy (and have a love for raspberry jam (jelly) on toast).</p><p>The Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen Edition looks every bit like a stereotypical gaming chair. Secretlab claims that the seat has been made softer, but it is still firmer than my Boulies chair — which pulls double duty as a gaming and office chair. But Secretlab’s chair really pushes the gaming aesthetic with hard edges and large logos.</p><p>Once built, I had to set the chair up to get the best sitting experience. This meant that I needed to tweak the settings, and this is where I had to pull out the manual.</p><p>To adjust the chair there are a series of dials, paddles, and catches. Starting from the top to bottom, while seated: On my left is the lumbar height adjustment dial, and on the right the lumbar curvature dial. Together, these dials are used to move the chair's lumbar support up and down the chair back, tweaking the curvature to match my back. After a short while tweaking the dials, I found a setting that supported my back and stopped any sciatica ache. Under the dials are the rails that guide the seat back onto the base — these are covered with a magnetic cover, which is a really nice touch that adds to the chair's overall quality and finish.</p><p>Next, we have the arm rests. They can move up and down, slide further into my side, slide further away, and move forwards and backwards. They can also twist diagonally to support my forearms. The included Secretlab PU foam armrest tops are nice, if a little cheap-feeling. They are magnetically held to the chair arms, and can be replaced with memory foam or cooling gel tops instead — for an extra cost, of course.</p><p>On the right side, at seat level, there is a lever which controls the backrest recline position. If you pull this lever without putting weight on the backrest, it will fly forward; otherwise it works like a typical backrest that reclines as you lean back on it. When you've found your position, return the lever to its original position and the back locks into place. The lever feels like I am pulling an ejector seat.</p><p>Underneath the seat are levers for chair height and tilt lock. The chair height lever uses your weight to move the seat down. Remove the weight and the chair will rise and you can tweak the height to your preference with a little patience. Tilt lock is used to alter the tilt angle of the seat. Moving the seat angle backward will place a little more pressure on your butt, moving it forward, and there will be more pressure on your legs. When you are comfy, lock it off and you won’t have to worry about falling over when you sit down. The final dial is for tilt tension, and twisting this will make the seat’s tilt mechanism feel stronger or weaker as you find a comfortable position.</p><p>The base of the chair is made from power coated steel and it has certainly got some weight to it. The base didn't creak or flex when loaded up with my 205 pounds (93kg) of weight, plus the weight of the seat. In the two weeks that I have been sitting on this chair, the base has remained scratch free, but the white does show every little speck of dust. Luckily, it's easy to wipe clean, with no seams to snag on as you wipe away dirt and grime. The included casters work on carpet, but I much prefer the aftermarket “rollerblade” casters that I purchased for my Boulies chair. On hard floors, the Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen Edition rolls around like a figure skater at the Winter Olympics, but on carpet it is difficult to move around without removing my weight from the chair.</p><h2 id=\"comfort-and-adjustments-2\">Comfort and Adjustments</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1800px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"XbTKXhXWM8WVi3tKQGiXDh\" name=\"leather\" alt=\"Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XbTKXhXWM8WVi3tKQGiXDh.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is the Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen Edition comfortable for a person of my size? Yes, but this is a gaming chair and not an office chair. What do I mean by this? The chair’s seat is much firmer than my previous Boulies chair, which was clearly made to be an office chair, first, and a gaming chair, second. Secretlab claims that the seat base has been “deliberately sculpted\" to be medium-firm. It's all about \"optimizing pressure distribution,” with firmness being used to counter pressure placed on your “sit bones.”  Some areas — notably, under the knees — are softer to provide support, but where my butt touches the seat, the seat pad is firmer and this makes long-term sitting not as comfortable as I would’ve liked.</p><p>The seat is supportive and I am not in pain, but a little more comfort for my butt would’ve been appreciated. Is it because of my weight or height? At just under 205 pounds (93kg), I am 15 pounds under the maximum weight for the Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen. My height of 5'7\" (172cm) is at the lowest end of the supported height.</p><p>I asked my wife to take a seat in the chair and tweak it to her own preferences. She is of a similar height to myself, but weighs about one-third of what I do. She found the chair comfortable and supportive in general,  but agreed that it was a little too firm for long term sitting.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"C7te4ZYG4WUzwBNdF77Zcm\" name=\"design2\" alt=\"Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7te4ZYG4WUzwBNdF77Zcm.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The magnetic head rest is genius. My old Boulies chair used an elastic band to keep the headrest attached, and made the chair look cheaper, overall. Finding a comfortable spot for the head rest took a little time — I didn’t want my head pushed too far forward, nor did I want the pillow to bury itself into the back of my neck. But I got there in the end: turns out, all I needed to do was adjust the pillow while wearing a hoodie.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:3200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"nUFBbCkAMooXAnapusA9rk\" name=\"design3\" alt=\"Secretlab Titan Evo NanoGen\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUFBbCkAMooXAnapusA9rk.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"3200\" height=\"1800\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leatherette material is comfortable, and I don’t see it becoming too sticky or clammy during the end of a remarkably hot British summer.

They started building the bus in September 2024, in the wake of Luke’s computer museum enlightenment at the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge (over 100 miles away). The Computer Bus was ready, in its current form, in September 2025. One of the generous donors to Retro Reset was actually the Centre for Computing History.</p><p>As well as hoping to spark interest in computers and consoles, old and new, it is hoped that the bus will provide insight into the workings of computers. Thus, as well as the plugged-in and powered-up devices spanning various computer gaming eras, the bus is stuffed with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/best-picks/best-pc-builds-gaming\">PC DIY</a> parts from various eras. This includes components like old servers, RAM sticks, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-gpus,4380.html\">graphics cards</a>, hard drives, floppy disks, and more.</p><p>Of course, a bus has limited onboard space, compared to what you might expect from even a small brick-and-mortar museum. So, many of you will probably be itching to know what devices the Retro Reset duo let visitors get their sticky hands upon.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:32.81%;\"><img id=\"qYCAXvDW8a3fFRZ55SAnhV\" name=\"inside-bus\" alt=\"Retro Reset Computer Bus\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qYCAXvDW8a3fFRZ55SAnhV.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1920\" height=\"630\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Inside the bus </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: <a href=\"https://retroreset.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Retro Reset</a>)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We couldn’t find a definitive retro equipment list (perhaps it rotates), but the sources indicate there are 10 systems up and running at any one time.

Just hours after release, the AAA military shooter achieved third place on Steam's most-played games chart today, achieving a peak concurrent player count of 747,000 (so far) on Steam alone.</p><p>X poster Kami claims Battlefield 6 has already broken a player count record, and is the most played \"full-priced\" shooter of all time (although we haven't been able to fact-check that claim just yet).</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the 14th most-played game on Steam so far, boasting a peak concurrent player count just shy of Baldur's Gate 3's 875,000 all-time equivalent and Hogwarts Legacy's 879,000. Battlefield 6's peak concurrent player count (at time of writing) is also 220,000 players greater than the open beta's all-time peak of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-reaches-all-time-record-half-a-million-concurrent-players-on-steam-520k-open-beta-surpasses-every-call-of-duty-ever-made-in-player-count\">520,000+</a>.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1426px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:62.97%;\"><img id=\"iWyZhLDQtxmJ9mfLmvfs5j\" name=\"Battlefield 6 day one concurrent player count on Steam\" alt=\"Battlefield 6 day one concurrent player count on Steam\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iWyZhLDQtxmJ9mfLmvfs5j.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1426\" height=\"898\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Steamdb.info)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Again, these numbers only account for Steam. It's easy to forget that Battlefield 6 is also available through the EA app and the Epic Games Store, in addition to Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5. It's essentially guaranteed that Battlefield 6's player numbers will exceed the millions on the PC platform alone across all three storefronts.</p><p>It's clear that Battlefield 6 represents a return to form for the franchise, and people are loving the game through and through. Battlefield 6 is the first Battlefield title to utilize EA's public Battlefield Labs playtesting, which allows real players to participate in the game's development — similar to Star Citizen. We saw the fruits of this playtesting in the Battlefield 6 open beta, which was one of the most (if not the) most successful open betas of any shooter game in history, with surprisingly few bugs.</p><p>Battlefield Labs also steered Battlefield 6's gameplay in the direction that players wanted. This includes the game's back-to-basics military theme, the removal of specialists (as seen in Battlefield 2042), and gameplay mechanics that are largely inspired by Battlefield Bad Company 2 and Battlefield 3.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has also proven to be a back-to-basics game in the PC graphics department. The game is the first AAA title in years designed to run at high frame rates at native resolution. This is backed up by the game's <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6s-modest-system-requirements-open-the-doors-to-gamers-of-all-budgets-six-year-old-gpus-meet-minimum-recommendations\">modest system requirements</a>, making it super accessible even to gamers on 5-year-old mid-range hardware. Furthermore, the developers have also <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-says-no-to-ray-tracing-now-and-in-the-near-future-dev-says-decision-made-to-focus-on-making-sure-it-was-performance-for-everyone-else\"><em>not</em></a><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-says-no-to-ray-tracing-now-and-in-the-near-future-dev-says-decision-made-to-focus-on-making-sure-it-was-performance-for-everyone-else\"> developed</a> any ray-tracing graphics for the game; instead, they have focused all their development time on improving the game's graphics for performance.</p><p>We are just hours into Battlefield 6's release. If we take into account the concurrent player count patterns from the open beta, we will likely we will see concurrent player numbers higher than 747,000 by the weekend.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/battlefield-6-peaks-at-747-000-concurrent-players-newly-launched-game-ranks-among-the-top-three-most-played-on-steam-today</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Hours after the Battlefield 6 launch, concurrent player counts have reached upwards of 747,000 on Steam, making the game the third most-played game on the platform. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">cyUmE9awEATXuurhDNaF3W</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2mC9MmkMN6oKTUhgYbYe28-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 20:09:44 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[PC Gaming]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Aaron Klotz) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Aaron Klotz ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2mC9MmkMN6oKTUhgYbYe28-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Steam]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Battlefield 6]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Battlefield 6]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2mC9MmkMN6oKTUhgYbYe28-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ InferenceMax AI benchmark tests software stacks, efficiency, and TCO — vendor-neutral suite runs nightly and tracks performance changes over time ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-backs-20-billion-xai-chip-deal\">News coverage</a> surrounding artificial intelligence almost invariably focuses on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/openai-signs-6gw-amd-gpu-deal\">the deals</a> that send <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/openai-makes-flurry-of-deals-in-drive-towards-for-profit-model-ai-giant-teams-up-with-nvidia-luxshare-apple-and-more\">hundreds of billions</a> of dollars flying, or the latest hardware developments in the GPU or datacenter world. Benchmarking efforts have almost exclusively focused on the silicon, though, and that's what SemiAnalysis intends to address with its open-source <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/inferencemax-open-source-inference\">InferenceMax AI benchmarking suite</a>. It measures the efficiency of the many components of AI software stacks in real-world inference scenarios (when AI models are actually \"running\" rather than being trained), and publishes those at the InferenceMax <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://inferencemax.ai/\">live dashboard</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://github.com/InferenceMAX/InferenceMAX\">InferenceMax is released </a>under the Apache 2.0 license and measures the performance of hundreds of AI accelerator hardware and software combinations, in a rolling-release fashion, getting new results nightly with recent versions of the software. As the project states, existing benchmarks are done at fixed points in time and don't necessarily show what the current versions are capable of; nor do they highlight the evolution (or regression, even) of software advancements across an entire AI stack with drivers, kernels, frameworks, models, and other components.</p><p>The benchmark is designed to be as neutral as possible and to mimic real-world applications. Rather than just focusing on absolute performance, InferenceMax's metrics try to reach the magic number that projects care about: TCO (total cost of ownership), in dollars per million tokens. As a simplification, a \"token\" is a measure of generated AI data. The basic performance measure is tokens per second GPU or user, each measure varying depending on how many requests are being served at any point.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1976px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:73.58%;\"><img id=\"QYDLCy3EkVhiWsyvyfrY8c\" name=\"throughput vs interactivity\" alt=\"A graph highlighting AI throughput vs interactivity\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYDLCy3EkVhiWsyvyfrY8c.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1976\" height=\"1454\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">Throughput vs. interactivity </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: SemiAnalysis - InferenceMax)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By the old adage of \"fast, big, or cheap — pick two\", a high <em>throughput</em> (measured in tok/s/gpu), meaning optimal GPU usage, is best obtained by serving many clients at once, as LLM inference relies on matrix multiplication, which in turn benefits from batching many requests. However, serving many requests at once lowers how much time the GPU can dedicate to a single one, so getting faster output (say, in a chatbot conversation) means increasing <em>interactivity</em> (measured as tok/s/user) and lowering throughput. For example, if you've ever seen ChatGPT responding as if it had a bad stutter, you know what happens when throughput is set too high versus interactivity.</p><p>As in any Goldilocks-type scenario, there's a perfect equilibrium between those two measures for a general-purpose setup. The ideal setup figures belong in the Pareto Frontier Curve, a specific area in a graph plotting throughput versus interactivity, handily illustrated by the diagram below. Since GPUs are purchased based on a dollar-per-hour cost when considering their price and power consumption (or when rented), the best GPU for any given scenario is not necessarily the fastest one — it'll be the one that's most efficient.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2852px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:34.82%;\"><img id=\"PRcPSVYNDVXVNTypeBaWaW\" name=\"4686438a-1880-4162-92c9-e64d2ab7718b_2852x993\" alt=\"InferenceMax graph detailing the Pareto Frontier Curve\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PRcPSVYNDVXVNTypeBaWaW.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2852\" height=\"993\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"caption-text\">The Pareto Frontier Curve </span><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: SemiAnalysis - InferenceMax)</span></figcaption></figure><p>InferenceMax remarks that high-interactivity cases are pricier than high-throughput cases, although potentially more profitable, as they'll be serving more users simultaneously. The one true measure for service providers, then, is the TCO, measured in dollars per million tokens. InferenceMax attempts to estimate this figure for various scenarios, including purchasing and owning GPUs versus renting them.</p><p>It's important to note that simply looking at performance graphs for a given GPU plus its associated software stack won't give you a good picture of what the best option is if all the metrics and the intended usage scenario aren't taken into consideration. Besides, InferenceMax ought to display how changes to the software stack, rather than the chips, will affect all the metrics above, and thus the TCO.</p><p>As practical examples, InferenceMax remarks that AMD's MI335X is actually competitive with Nvidia's big B200 in TCO, even though the latter is way faster. On the other hand, AMD's FP4 (a 4-bit floating-point format) kernels appear to have room for improvement, as scenarios/models that depend on this math are mostly the domain of Nvidia's chips.</p><p>For its 1.0 release, InferenceMax supports a mix of Nvidia's GB200, NVL72, B200, H200, and H100 accelerators, as well as AMD's Instinct MI355X, MI325X, and MI300X. The project notes that it expects to add support for Google's Tensor units and AWS Trainium in the coming months. The benchmarks are run nightly via GitHub's action runners. Both AMD and Nvidia were asked for real-world configuration sets for GPUs and the software stack, as these can be tuned thousands of different ways.</p><p>While on the topic of vendor collaboration, InferenceMax thanks many people across major vendors and multiple cloud hosting providers who worked with the project, some even fixing bugs overnight. The project also uncovered multiple bugs in both Nvidia and AMD setups, highlighting the rapid pace of development and deployment of AI acceleration setups.</p><p>The collaboration resulted in patches to AMD's ROCm (the equivalent of Nvidia's CUDA), with InferenceMax noting that AMD should focus on providing its users with better default configurations, as there are reportedly too many parameters that need tuning to achieve optimal performance. On the Nvidia side, the project saw some headwinds with the freshly minted Blackwell drivers, encountering some snags around initialization/termination that became apparent in benchmarking scenarios that spin instances up and down in rapid succession.</p><p>If you have more than a passing interest in the area, you should read InferenceMax's <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/inferencemax-open-source-inference\">announcement and write-up</a>.

It seems like this meeting is now off the table, as President Trump <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115350455734003647\">has just posted a scathing message</a> on his Truth Social platform, accusing China of monopolizing every element of the rare earth mineral pipeline. In retaliation, \"massive increases of tariffs\" are being mulled for Chinese products entering America, among other moves that would appear to chart a new, more hostile era in the China-U.S. trade war.</p><iframe allow=\"\" height=\"0\" width=\"600\" id=\"\" style=\"max-width: 100%; border: 0\" data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/115350455734003647/embed\"></iframe><p>The move comes in response to yesterday's surprise move, which saw <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-expands-rare-earth-export-controls\">China's commerce ministry mandate new government licenses </a>for advanced chips made using Chinese-origin rare earths, directly or indirectly. The <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/chinas-new-rare-earth-curbs-hit-14nm-and-256-layer-chipmaking\">criteria for advanced chips</a> are logic fabricated at 14nm or below and memory at 256 layers or above. The new rules would require companies to essentially acquire permission from Beijing to \"export\" out of China, even if the product using their rare earths was never manufactured there. This is what Trump is largely referring to in his post, highlighting how such a trade curb is unprecedented.</p><p>Rare earth minerals are crucial in various industries, including semiconductors and other computer hardware, and China controls most of the world's supply. The U.S. government has already considered <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-mulls-allocating-usd2b-of-chips-act-funds-to-boost-u-s-critical-minerals-supply-chain-move-aims-to-reduce-american-dependence-on-china-for-its-rare-earth-needs\">allocating $2 billion worth of CHIPS Act funds toward rare earths development</a> in a bid to reduce foreign reliance. President Trump is claiming that China is contacting countries around the globe to expand its dominance in this sector, using it as a powerful bargaining chip in this trade war. Malaysia has <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/after-locking-out-the-u-s-china-offers-rare-earth-development-assistance-to-malaysia-insists-on-partnering-with-state-owned-companies-only\">already been in talks with Beijing,</a> which is interested in helping the country extract its newly-found mineral reserves.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-global-chipmaking-supply-chains\">China initially imposed export controls</a> on rare earths back in April of this year, which have only tightened since, with yesterday's order serving as a red line for the White House, which now sees this as grounds enough for proper retaliation. President Trump's message states that he'll be \"forced to counter\" China's every move, almost warning Americans that such actions could be painful in the short term, but necessary in the long term. The U.S. already heavily sanctions China, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/despite-us-sanctions-researchers-in-china-can-still-access-high-end-nvidia-gpus-for-ai\">barring it from receiving high-end AI GPUs</a>, citing national security concerns — which is what Beijing is echoing now.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1280px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:66.64%;\"><img id=\"JKt64GcE7qnUBCToYJn5E7\" name=\"GettyImages-2227113709\" alt=\"China\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKt64GcE7qnUBCToYJn5E7.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Getty Images)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, Trump openly admits that the U.S. also has a monopoly, which is generally considered anti-competitive; however, the tables turn when sovereignty is involved. Trump says that America has two elements for every one that China tries to monopolize, which could refer to the aforementioned GPUs. Today, the U.S. Senate passed a bill that seeks to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/u-s-senate-passes-bill-that-forces-ai-chipmakers-to-prioritize-sales-to-american-companies-house-now-set-to-amend-or-pass-legislation\">prioritize AI chip sales for domestic companies</a> over those of foreign entities.

However, TSMC's N2 is <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intels-18a-and-tsmcs-n2-process-nodes-compared-intel-is-faster-but-tsmc-is-denser\">projected</a> to offer considerably higher high-density (HD) standard-cell transistor density (313 MTr/mm^2) compared to Intel's 18A (238 MTr/mm^2), according to reports.</p><p>While most modern designs use a mix of high-density (HD), high-performance (HP), and low-power (LP) standard cells, higher HD transistor density could still mean lower per-transistor costs for the foundry. However, it is unclear whether these savings will be passed on to the company's clients.</p><p>Furthermore, it should be noted that when comparing the transistor density of Intel's 18A, which features a backside power delivery network, with TSMC's N2, which uses a traditional frontside PDN, the comparison is not entirely accurate. Intel's 18A leaves the front side almost entirely for signal interconnects and logic transistors, whereas TSMC's N2 uses plenty of transistors on the front side for power distribution (power-gating header/footer switches, ESD, MOS decaps, on-die regulators, etc.). As a result, 18A's and N2's effective transistor densities could be very close.</p><p>However, flipping the wafer and producing a power delivery network on the backside costs money, so Intel's 18A is likely a more expensive process technology to fabricate than TSMC's N2, which will not be a problem for premium products, though.</p><p>While 18A looks good in general on paper, the competitiveness of Intel's Core Ultra 3 'Panther Lake' and Xeon 6+ 'Clearwater Forest' is an important step for Intel toward regaining manufacturing credibility and attracting external foundry customers for 18A, 18A-P, and future 14A nodes.</p><h2 id=\"production-slip-and-intel-18a-yields-2\">Production slip and Intel 18A yields</h2><p>Intel says Panther Lake's compute tiles on 18A 'began early production' at its development and low-volume fabs in Oregon, and 'is now ramping toward high-volume production in Arizona.' As expected, Intel first began to ramp Panther Lake manufacturing at Fab 52. Apparently, Fab 62 is still under construction and will be ramped up when demand for 18A picks up.</p><p>The first Panther Lake CPU model is 'slated to ship before the end of the year and broad market availability starting January 2026.' Such an announcement signals a delay, as originally Intel indicated the availability of Panther Lake processors in 2025. Furthermore, the announcement may also highlight a slower-than-expected volume ramp, as the company previously indicated that additional Panther Lake models (not just the halo SKU) would be rolled out in the first quarter of 2026. This time around, Intel didn't reveal when it expects the whole Panther Lake product lineup to ramp up.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:728px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.73%;\"><img id=\"vfZptrDfS3Z7ApSphcRXai\" name=\"image (48).png\" alt=\"Intel\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfZptrDfS3Z7ApSphcRXai.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"413\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The delay of Intel's Panther Lake launch and the slower ramp of its 18A process may suggest that the node may have yield, performance variability, or packaging challenges. However, Intel presented a defect density (D0) graph showing their consistent decrease. Taking a page from some of its rivals, Intel did not mark the Y-axis of the graph, so all we know is that 18A's defect density decreased from <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/intel-says-defect-density-at-18a-is-healthy-potential-clients-are-lining-up\">0.4 defects per square centimeter in Q3 2024</a> to somewhere below that figure in Q3 2025.</p><p>While D0 is an important metric, it does not significantly relate to parametric yields, which define whether a chip achieves its desired performance and power targets. For example, a chip can be defect-free but still fail to meet performance or power targets due to a narrow process window, systematic or random critical dimension (CD) variations, stochastic line-edge roughness (LER) variations, transistor mismatch, or marginal design corners.</p><p>Intel stresses that 18A yields (we presume, the yields of Panther Lake's compute tile) are equal or better than those of chips produced on previous-generation nodes in the last 15 years, though it is logical that a relatively small compute tile of Panther Lake (100 – 110 mm^2) has higher functional yield of rather big monolithic CPUs from 2012 – 2018 (122 mm^2 – 160 mm^2 ) and large monolithic CPUs from 2018 – 2022 (180 mm^2 – 276 mm^2).</p><p>Anyway, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-delays-key-xeon-data-center-processor-amid-massive-losses-clearwater-forest-pushed-back-to-1h-2026\">despite an earlier delay</a>, Intel's 288-core Xeon 6+ 'Clearwater Forest' data center is still on track for launch in the first half of 2026, which suggests that the issues (if there are issues) are identified and are on track to be solved in the next nine months.</p><p>Strategically, even though some may argue Intel 18A was successful due to Intel's goalposts being defined as when the node was 'production ready' as opposed to when it began production, the delay weakens Intel’s credibility in its 'five nodes in four years' roadmap and diminishes its opportunity to leap ahead of TSMC's N2, which is expected to enter high-volume production in Q4 2025 and ramp numerous client and data center products in the first half of 2026. As a result, instead of a clear process leadership win, Intel risks being perceived as merely catching up.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

As reported by <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/senate-passes-ai-chip-export-limits-on-nvidia-amd-to-china\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the bipartisan bill sailed easily through the Senate and is now under consideration by the House.</p><p>“Today, the Senate acted to make sure American customers — including small businesses and startups —aren’t forced to wait in line behind China’s tech giants when purchasing the latest AI chips,” Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who co-sponsored the bill, said in a statement. Senator Jim Bank (R-IN), who is the lead co-sponsor of the bill, also noted that this bill will bolster the U.S. competitiveness in AI and other cutting-edge industries while reducing exports to U.S. rivals, particularly China.</p><p>The House of Representatives has already passed its version of the NDAA, but the provision saying that chipmakers must put exports on the back burner in favor of local sales is missing. Because of this, the two chambers must now work together to create a compromise, but whether this rule will be part of the final version that will be signed by the president is still up for debate.</p><p>Nvidia has always <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/u-s-legislators-want-nvidia-to-give-american-buyers-first-option-in-ai-gpu-purchases-before-selling-chips-to-other-countries-including-allies-gain-ai-act-debuts-in-defense-spending-bill\">criticized this bill</a>, saying that its global sales “do not deprive U.S. customers of anything” and that the logic behind it was “based on doomer science fiction.” The <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/nvidia-says-we-never-deprive-american-customers-in-order-to-serve-the-rest-of-the-world-company-says-gain-ai-act-addresses-a-problem-that-doesnt-exist\">company also said</a> that it was “trying to solve a problem that does not exist” and that it would “restrict competition worldwide in any industry that uses mainstream computing chips.” Nvidia has said that its H20 shipments do not affect the supply of H100, H200, and Blackwell chips, which makes sense as these all use different parts, and that the supply of one will not affect the supply of the other.</p><p>Although China is Nvidia’s largest market next to the U.S., its China sales still dwarf in comparison. The United States accounts for nearly half of Nvidia’s sales in FY 2024, while China is only at 13% of its overall revenue.

rapid AI expansion continues, investment could top $30 billion ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>SoftBank is arranging a new $5 billion margin loan to invest in OpenAI and use its shares in Arm Holdings as collateral, reports <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-10/softbank-in-talks-for-5-billion-margin-loan-backed-by-arm-stock\">Bloomberg</a>. The move will enable the company to increase its stake in OpenAI and/or invest in the company's infrastructure, while taking the company's total borrowing against Arm shares to $18.5 billion.</p><p>The Japanese investment company is said to be negotiating with several international banks to finalize the deal, which will be collateralized by Arm stock. The company had already tapped $13.5 billion in margin loans from Arm shares by March 2025, with $5 billion still unused at that time, which gives it some flexibility to expand its credit base further.</p><p>The approach is not uncommon for SoftBank, as it is usual practice for the company to draw cash from its most valuable asset rather than sell equity. Arm's shares were up 38% this year, which gives Softbank more collateral room.</p><p>SoftBank's campaign to become a dominant force in the AI sector has become increasingly costly. The company joined the $500 billion Stargate project with OpenAI and Oracle to build massive U.S. data center infrastructure early this year, pledged up to $30 billion to OpenAI, purchased ABB's robotics business for $5.4 billion, took over Graphcore for an undisclosed sum, and agreed to purchase <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/arm-considers-acquisition-of-oracle-backed-ampere-computing-to-expand-data-center-footprint\">Ampere Computing for $6.5 billion</a>.</p><p>Bloomberg Intelligence's Sharon Chen estimates SoftBank’s total financing needs could surpass $30 billion, considering the possible purchase of Ampere Computing and other ventures.</p><p>The latest borrowing follows a series of large financings tied to the AI push. SoftBank previously arranged $8 billion in margin loans ahead of Arm's 2023 IPO through lenders such as JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, and Goldman Sachs, and later secured a $15 billion one-year loan to fund AI projects in the U.S. Together, these moves have transformed Arm's stock into the group's main source of liquidity.</p><p>The analyst warned that these commitments could push the group close to its 25 % loan-to-value threshold, raising concerns about its credit profile. While SoftBank may use asset sales or structured financing to offset risk, its growing demands for cash highlight how heavily its strategy depends on the market value of Arm and the continued strength of AI-related equities. On the one hand, this puts SoftBank at the center of the AI boom, but on the other hand, it also places it at the frontier of its potential instability.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/softbank-is-seeking-usd5-billion-loan-to-invest-in-openai-plans-to-use-arm-shares-as-collateral-rapid-ai-expansion-continues-investment-could-top-usd30-billion</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ SoftBank is securing a $5 billion loan backed by Arm shares to expand its OpenAI and AI infrastructure investments, raising total Arm-collateralized debt to $18.5 billion and further highlighting its leveraged AI expansion strategy. ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">62HvcVGAiRMr4BSsLNmShF</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GS89WEqgsTxq2rNHfF2bL-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 16:51:36 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence]]></category>\n                                                    <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ ashilov@gmail.com (Anton Shilov) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Anton Shilov ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GS89WEqgsTxq2rNHfF2bL-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Tomohiro Ohsumi]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Softbank CEO]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Softbank CEO]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GS89WEqgsTxq2rNHfF2bL-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Microsoft cancels Wisconsin data center after community pushback — 244-acre Caledonia site on hold, but Redmond says it remains committed to the region ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Microsoft has cancelled its initial plan of building a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, after residents and elected officials objected to the plan. According to the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2025/10/08/microsoft-pulls-plans-for-data-center-in-caledonia-wisconsin/86580822007/\"><em>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</em></a>, Redmond is cancelling its application for the current site, although it’s still looking at building one in a different location in Caledonia or in another part of Racine County.</p><p>“Based on the community feedback we heard, we have chosen not to move forward with this site,” Microsoft said to the publication. “We remain committed to investing in Southeast Wisconsin and look forward to working with the Village of Caledonia and Racine County leaders to identify a site that aligns with community priorities and our long-term development goals.”</p><p>Microsoft’s plan for the original Caledonia site, called Project Nova, was to build a 244-acre facility containing three data center structures and a 15-acre electrical substation. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-cancels-plans-for-data-center-caledonia-wisconsin/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter\"><em>Data Center Dynamics</em></a> reports that the company planned to construct it a little over a mile west of the We Energies Oak Creek Power Plant. This makes it a convenient location, especially as data centers consume a ton of electricity.</p><p>The residents' complaints were not listed in the news report, but it’s not hard to imagine their concerns. Data centers are notorious for <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/ai-data-centers-soaring-energy-consumption-is-causing-skyrocketing-power-bills-for-households-across-the-us-states-reporting-spikes-in-energy-costs-of-up-to-36-percent\">causing spikes in power bills</a>.

back to older 14nm process tech and 256-layer memory ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>China has quietly extended its rare-earth export controls into the heart of the semiconductor supply chain.</p><p>Based on a machine translation of a <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zwgk/zcfb/art/2025/art_7fc9bff0fb4546ecb02f66ee77d0e5f6.html\" target=\"_blank\">new notice</a> published October 9, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said that exports of Chinese-origin rare earths or products made with them will now require government licenses if they’re linked to the development or manufacture of advanced chips — defined as logic at 14 nanometers or below, or memory with 256 layers or more.</p><p>The new measure builds on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-global-chipmaking-supply-chains\">rules introduced in April</a>, which imposed licensing requirements on seven rare-earth families, including samarium, terbium, dysprosium, and lutetium, as well as their magnet and sputtering-target forms. Those elements are central to chip fabrication and data storage, used in thin-film deposition, polishing compounds, and high-performance HDD motors, but the expansion goes further by introducing an end-use test tied directly to semiconductor thresholds and extending China’s jurisdiction beyond its borders.</p><p>Under MOFCOM’s updated framework, any item containing amounts of Chinese-origin rare earths, or produced using Chinese rare-earth technologies, can be subject to Beijing’s export licensing regime if its value contribution exceeds 0.1%. That means foreign companies handling downstream materials or components could find themselves caught in China’s compliance net, even when the transaction involves no Chinese entity. Officials say the policy is meant to “safeguard national security” and ensure that exports do not “enhance military potential” of any recipient.</p><p>This phrasing <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/13/2022-21658/implementation-of-additional-export-controls-certain-advanced-computing-and-semiconductor\" target=\"_blank\">mirrors the language</a> used by the U.S. Commerce Department when Washington set its own semiconductor export thresholds — 14/16nm for logic, 18nm for DRAM, and 128-layer for NAND — under rules aimed at preventing Chinese access to military-use AI hardware. China’s policy effectively flips that logic back outward, targeting the upstream materials needed to make such chips in the first place.</p><p>The new controls could slow approvals for polishing media and other rare-earth-based consumables used in front-end processes. It could also complicate global HDD production. <em>TrendForce </em>noted in April that rare earth restrictions may affect Seagate and Western Digital, both of which rely on Chinese-origin magnets, as well as other semiconductor and storage firms.</p><p>These latest restrictions illustrate just how far export enforcement has spread across both sides of the tech divide. In the space of a year, the U.S. has <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-h20-gpus-reportedly-caught-up-in-u-s-commerce-departments-worst-export-license-backlog-in-30-years-billions-of-dollars-worth-of-gpus-and-other-products-in-limbo-due-to-staffing-cuts-communication-issues\">tightened controls on advanced GPUs</a>, while China has moved upstream to the raw materials, processing technologies, and metallurgical know-how that enable chip production.

This Canadian company was one of the institutions that revealed <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/huaweis-latest-ai-processors-were-allegedly-made-by-tsmc-report\">Huawei used TSMC to build the Ascend 910B chip</a> despite American sanctions — resulting in <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmc-faces-usd1-billion-us-fine-for-doing-business-with-huawei\">a possible $1-billion fine</a> for the Taiwanese chip maker.</p><p>According to the announcement by the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.mofcom.gov.cn/zcfb/dwmygl/art/2025/art_fbfc3daae14841d392d31b908356cb7f.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ministry of Commerce</a> [machine translated] (via <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/china-blacklists-researchers-that-exposed-huawei-chip-secrets\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a>), organizations and individuals within China are prohibited “from engaging in transactions, cooperation, and other activities with the aforementioned entities, especially transmitting data or providing sensitive information to these entities.”</p><p>TechInsights and all its subsidiaries across the globe are included in the ban. But what’s interesting is that the research firm has been specifically mentioned in the government announcement, and that most of the other companies on the list are defense contractors and aerospace companies like Elbit Systems of America and BAE Systems. There’s also a smattering of anti-drone companies, like Dedrone and Epirus, which developed <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/high-power-microwave-system-downs-49-drones-in-one-shot-weaponized-electromagnetic-interference-erases-drone-swarms-en-masse\">the Leonidas microwave system</a> that can take down drone swarms.</p><p>“Foreign entities such as Dedrone by Axon and TechInsights and their affiliates have defied China’s strong objections to engage in activities such as so-called military-technical cooperation with Taiwan, made malicious remarks concerning China, and assisted foreign governments in suppressing Chinese companies,” China said in another statement.</p><p>It’s understandable for China to add all the other companies to its Unreliable Entity List, especially given that most of them have defense projects and work with the military forces of the nation’s rivals, like the U.S. and Taiwan. But TechInsights isn’t a military or defense contractor — it’s primarily a semiconductor intelligence firm that specializes in reverse engineering and teardowns, plus market analysis.</p><p>The primary reason why it may have been added to the list is that it investigated Huawei, one of China’s crown jewels when it comes to tech companies. Although the country’s semiconductor industry has taken strides in recent years, TechInsight’s investigations in 2023 and 2024 revealed Huawei’s reliance on technologies and chips from TSMC, Samsung, and SK hynix, which might’ve contradicted Beijing’s strategic push for semiconductor self-reliance.</p><p>Because it’s located outside of China, TechInsights will likely still be able to make teardowns of Chinese tech it can acquire and publish its findings. Still, we’re unsure how China’s announcement will affect its business operations, especially as the company has not released any statement at the time of writing.</p><a href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:676px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:31.51%;\"><img id=\"7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56\" name=\"Follow Tom's Hardware\" alt=\"Google Preferred Source\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cUTDmN2PHNRiNBVqbKf56.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"left\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"676\" height=\"213\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"pull-left\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our latest news, analysis, & reviews in your feeds.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/china-bans-research-company-that-helped-unearth-huaweis-use-of-tsmc-tech-despite-u-s-bans-techinsights-added-to-unreliable-entity-list-by-state-authorities</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Beijing has banned TechInsights from doing business with Chinese companies because it has \"defied China's strong objections to engage in activities such as so-called military-technical cooperation with Taiwan, made malicious remarks concerning China, and assisted foreign governments in suppressing Chinese companies.\" ]]>\n                                                                                                            </description>\n                                                                                                                                <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">akhaSbVanf2sb6HEgKRbPU</guid>\n                                                                                                <enclosure url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pxT6ZmtWJuEUxrRahtNvfS-1280-80.jpg\" type=\"image/jpeg\" length=\"0\"></enclosure>\n                                                                        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 13:55:57 +0000</pubDate>                                                                                                                        <category><![CDATA[Tech Industry]]></category>\n                                                                                                <author><![CDATA[ editors@tomshardware.com (Jowi Morales) ]]></author>                    <dc:creator><![CDATA[ Jowi Morales ]]></dc:creator>                                                                                                    <media:content type=\"image/jpeg\" url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pxT6ZmtWJuEUxrRahtNvfS-1280-80.jpg\">\n                                                            <media:credit><![CDATA[Getty / MirageC]]></media:credit>\n                                                                                                                    <media:text><![CDATA[Semiconductor up close]]></media:text>\n                                <media:title type=\"plain\"><![CDATA[Semiconductor up close]]></media:title>\n                                                    </media:content>\n                                                    <media:thumbnail url=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pxT6ZmtWJuEUxrRahtNvfS-1280-80.jpg\" />\n                                                                                        </item>\n                    <item>\n                                                            <title><![CDATA[ Microsoft deploys world's first 'supercomputer-scale' GB300 NVL72 Azure cluster — 4,608 GB300 GPUs linked together to form a single, unified accelerator capable of 92.1 exaFLOPS of FP4 inference ]]></title>\n                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Microsoft has <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-delivers-the-first-large-scale-cluster-with-nvidia-gb300-nvl72-for-openai-workloads/\" target=\"_blank\">just upgraded its Azure cloud platform</a> with Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, deploying what it calls the world's first large-scale GB300 NVL72 supercomputing cluster.

That would technically put it way behind a full hyperscale expansion, but this still marks a significant milestone for Nvidia's Grace Blackwell GB300, which <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-claims-software-and-hardware-upgrades-allow-blackwell-ultra-gb300-to-dominate-mlperf-benchmarks-touts-45-percent-deepseek-r-1-inference-throughput-increase-over-gb200\" target=\"_blank\">recently set new benchmark records </a>in inference performance. Microsoft says this cluster will be dedicated to OpenAI workloads, allowing for advanced reasoning models to run even faster and enable model training in “weeks instead of months.”</p><p>At rack level, each NVL72 system is said to deliver 1,440 petaflops of FP4 Tensor performance, powered by 37 terabytes of unified “fast memory,” which breaks down to 20 TB HBM3E for the GPU, and 17 TB LPDDR5X for the Grace CPU. As mentioned earlier, this memory is pooled together using NVLink 5 to make each rack work as a single, unified accelerator capable of 130 TB/s of direct bandwidth.

The report says enforcement teams have been deployed at major ports to inspect data-center hardware, with a specific focus on Nvidia’s H20 and RTX 6000D — chips designed to comply with U.S. export controls but now under fresh scrutiny from Beijing.</p><p>The inspections, which began in recent weeks, are reportedly being coordinated by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), with assistance from customs officials. The campaign initially targeted the H20 and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/why-nobody-is-buying-nvidia-6000d-in-china\">RTX 6000D</a>, but has since broadened to include “all advanced semiconductor products.” The <em>FT</em> says that officials are focused on stopping smuggled U.S. chips from reaching domestic data centers. Nvidia declined to comment when contacted by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>.</p><p>China’s pressure on the H20 is especially notable. Announced last year as a tailored workaround to avoid falling afoul of Washington’s updated export rules, the H20 had only recently <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/u-s-legislators-criticize-decision-to-resume-nvidia-h20-gpu-shipments-to-china-demand-new-export-rules-for-ai-hardware\">begun shipping in volume</a> to Chinese server OEMs. Given that the likes of ByteDance and Alibaba were reportedly told in mid-September to halt further H20 orders, some or all of those shipments will now undoubtedly be held up or blocked indefinitely.</p><p>These inspections are likely to hit China’s gray and refurbishment market, which has leaned on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/china-repurposes-used-nvidia-gpus\">repurposed A100 and H100 boards</a> as H20 access tightened, with underground repair shops servicing hundreds of accelerators each month. The Financial Times previously reported at least a billion dollars’ worth of high-end Nvidia processors entering the country in the three months after tighter U.S. rules, often through indirect routes. A customs sweep could directly target that pipeline.</p><p>At the same time, China’s homegrown roadmap is real but uneven. China’s decision to begin cracking down on imports might reflect a growing confidence in its domestic hardware, but while domestic accelerators are ramping up at Chinese fabs, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/chinas-chip-champions-ramp-up-production-of-ai-accelerators-at-domestic-fabs-but-hbm-and-fab-production-capacity-are-towering-bottlenecks\">bottlenecks exist in HBM supply and overall fab capacity</a>. This suggests near-term friction for data-center operators with more delays for inbound H20 RTX 6000D shipments on one side — that may well never reach them — and slower-than-hoped rollouts of homegrown silicon on the other.</p><p>The H20’s own status also remains unsettled. Nvidia has told some suppliers to pause H20-related work amid changing rules, while exploring a successor that would comply with U.S. controls. If that successor slips or ships in limited volume, the practical effect of China’s crackdown will be felt twice over, with fewer legal Nvidia pathways and a harder environment for gray-market cards.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Companies from Singapore have long been suspected of procuring restricted AI accelerators from Nvidia to ship to China, bypassing <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/us-prohibits-exports-of-nvidias-a800-and-h800-to-china-blacklists-chinese-gpu-developers\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. sanctions.</a> Although <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/underground-network-smuggles-nvidia-gpus-into-china-despite-us-sanctions-some-smugglers-even-sell-entire-servers\" target=\"_blank\">a few smuggling networks have been found</a>, establishing a direct link has been tenuous until now.</p><p>In 2024, Singapore-based company Megaspeed was led by Alice Huang (no relation to Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia), who was a little-known player in the AI or hardware industries, but who attended a party with the CEO of Nvidia at Computex 2024 after committing to buy $2 billion worth of Nvidia GPUs over the next year. Megaspeed emerged in 2023 when 7Road, a Chinese gaming and cloud-computing firm backed by state investors, created an offshore unit in Singapore. The new entity began purchasing massive quantities of restricted Nvidia AI GPUs, such as H100 and H800, which are officially not accessible to buyers from China.</p><p>A curious wrinkle is that Megaspeed did not purchase Nvidia hardware directly, but its procurements originated from Aivres Systems, a California-based arm of Inspur, a major Chinese technology company previously sanctioned by the U.S. for supplying the Chinese military with supercomputing hardware. Because Aivres operates as a U.S. company, it could lawfully purchase Nvidia products and resell them as long as they met U.S. export rules (which it did), exploiting a regulatory loophole that separated Inspur's American entity from its blacklisted parent.</p><p>Megaspeed allegedly routed these acquisitions to facilities in Indonesia and Malaysia, which belong to Speedmatrix, its subsidiary. These facilities allegedly enabled cloud access to restricted AI GPUs to entities from China, or simply re-exported them to the People's Republic, according to the <em>NYT,</em> citing U.S. officials, though no definitive proof has been made public. Singaporean police reportedly told <em>NYT</em> that Megaspeed is being investigated for breaching local laws, but didn't say which ones.</p><p>An inspection by the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security at Megaspeed's Malaysian data center in late 2024 raised further suspicion. Inspectors reportedly found Nvidia servers and GPUs still sealed in their crates, an unusual practice for AI data centers, suggesting the technology might be awaiting re-export. Following that visit, American officials raised concerns with Megaspeed's Singaporean and Malaysian counterparts and began coordinating enforcement actions. Meanwhile, reporters found Megaspeed's offices nearly empty: two staff in Singapore who did not know what their company was doing, a tiny Malaysian storefront with no engineers, and neighbors unaware of its purpose. Records still traced ownership to shell firms run from Shanghai.</p><p>By mid-2025, Megaspeed halted all hardware orders from Nvidia after regional crackdowns on AI-hardware exports. Once planning another $3.2 billion in Nvidia systems, it stopped buying in July when probes expanded and its executive, Alice Huang, quietly departed.</p><p>Nvidia said its checks found Megaspeed legally qualified and showed no signs of diversion. It added that Megaspeed was wholly owned and operated by a company based outside China and had no shareholders in China. However, former U.S. officials questioned by the <em>NYT</em> argued its links to China and sanctioned firms should have barred sales of restricted hardware to the company. Still, considering the fact that Aivres managed to procure AI GPUs from Nvidia in the U.S., it could have used a different shell company to ship the hardware outside of America to a gray zone in Asia.</p><p>Commerce Department officials are reportedly looking into Megaspeed as part of an ongoing investigation.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\" target=\"_blank\"><em>add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

                                                       <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Sony is finally spilling the beans on some of the hardware upgrades it will be bringing to its next-generation console. AMD's senior VP and general manager of computing and graphics at AMD, Jack Huynh, and Sony's PS5 Lead Architect, Mark Cerny, published a collaborative video discussing new technologies that are being worked on as part of their collaboration, Project Amethyst. Some of these technologies include massive upgrades to AI rendering and ray tracing performance. The new hardware is likely to be part of the PlayStation 6, or possibly a handheld option.</p><p>Most of the nine-minute video discussed two new technologies that the two companies are working on together: Neural Arrays and Radiance Cores. Neural Arrays represent an optimization toward the AI-accelerators housed in each compute unit of AMD's modern RDNA architectures, which will network all of the CUs together.</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1LCMzw-_dMw\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This feature will reportedly allow a GPU to process a \"large chunk of the screen in one go\". The duo didn't go into significant detail about the new technology, but on the surface, Neural Arrays appears to be an \"Infinity Fabric\" style interconnect that will connect every single compute unit together and allow each compute unit to talk to each other directly without spilling out to cache.</p><p>One interesting tidbit is that this feature appears to be targeted exclusively toward improving AI-rendering performance, despite the fact that Neural Arrays apparently connects the entirety of each compute unit together (not just the AI portions of the CU).</p><p>Radiance Cores represent a new dedicated hardware block on a GPU that will reportedly speed up ray-traced rendering significantly and make real-time path-tracing possible. Radiance Cores takes the ray transversal part of the ray tracing pipeline and takes full control of it, processing it independently of the shader cores to speed up rendering time.</p><p>Memory compression is also getting a big upgrade; AMD and Sony are moving to a new technology called Universal Compression that allows all data types to be compressed \"whenever possible\". This is a big change from the <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/ps5-pro-confirmed-new-playstation-will-cost-dollar69999-on-november-5-with-larger-gpu-and-pssr-upscaling\">PS5</a> series' outgoing compression implementation (Delta Color Compression), which can allegedly only compress certain data elements, including textures and render targets.</p><p>The introduction of these technologies, particularly Neural Arrays and Radiance Cores, shows that the next-generation Sony console (probably the PS6) will be designed to play ray-traced and path-traced games with equivalent performance to PC graphics card hardware that we have today. Cerny and Huynh also all but confirmed that the next-gen console will take full advantage of <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amds-fsr-redstone-uses-machine-learning-to-achieve-parity-with-nvidia-dlss\">FSR Redstone</a> and its suite of machine learning features.</p><p>The PS5 and PS5 Pro technically have ray-tracing capabilities, but they are noticeably worse than what Nvidia or even AMD's latest GPUs are capable of (especially relating to the vanilla PS5). If you haven't caught on by now, Project Amethyst is the codename for Sony's next-generation console, which will likely be the PS6, but it could potentially include a handheld counterpart as well, as some outlets have speculated.</p><p>Arguably, the best part is that we can expect all of these technologies to make their way into future AMD graphics cards. Jack Huynh confirmed that the Universal Compression tech will be coming to future AMD SoCs and GPUs.

Sometimes you get a pair with your printer, but if you don't, or you need a spare set, then I have an alternative source for you.</p><p>I’ve got a couple of these cheap cutters. For getting started they are superb. They are useful for 3D printing, electronics and general home maintenance tasks. Sure the metal is a little soft, but for 3D printing they are tough enough to cut through plastics.</p><p>Being flush wire cutters means that we get a clean edge to our snip. That’s useful when we need to trim some filament to slide down a bowden tube or for removing stubborn supports. Model makers and electronics hobbyists can also use these cutters. Models makers use them to trim parts from a sprue, electronics users will trim component legs and snip wires.</p><p>These are cheap and reliable. In fact they are so cheap, you may as well buy multiple pairs.</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"22258e8a-47fd-477a-8ce4-60cd1c43b3a4\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"Trim, cut and rip plastic from places where it shouldn’t be.

I first came across them when I was servicing mountain bikes in the 1990s (true story) and I found that the metal used in cheaper tools was almost like butter.<br>3D printers are generally held together by machine screws sporting an allen / hex head. You will normally get a selected set of wrenches with your printer, and these generally do a good job (unless you overtighten the screws). But having a more durable and expansive set will prepare you for future tasks.</p><p><strong>Wera Hex Key Set (covering all the key sizes)</strong></p><p>These allen wrenches / hex keys from Wera will elevate the your experience from \"cheap hex key junk\" to \"sublime\".

In the case of PLA, it cools down and lifts from the print bed in a few minutes. For my new favourite filament, PETG, it takes much longer to cool down and when I use a brim, the bed adhesion is challenging.</p><p>Scrapers are great tools, and your 3D printer will usually come with a plastic scraper, or the STL files to print your own. But what if you need something a little better?</p><p>The thin metal blades are designed to get under the print, or if the print is stuck, to gently lift the brim to break the adhesion.

I say most, because the hex bits only go up to 2.5mm and that wasn’t large enough for some of the hex screws on my Elegoo Neptune 3 Pro.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this will take 4mm bits so if you are missing your favorite bit, you can pick it up and add it to the handle.</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"4a8bcccc-8e9b-4b6e-a0a6-f2cb628fd2c0\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"Sleek, compact and with 24 double-ended bits crammed inside, the Hoto 23-in-1 precision screwdriver should be in your 3D printer toolkit.\" data-dimension48=\"Sleek, compact and with 24 double-ended bits crammed inside, the Hoto 23-in-1 precision screwdriver should be in your 3D printer toolkit.\" data-dimension25=\"$14.99\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Screwdriver-Precision-Electronics-Bracelets/dp/B08X6WNPLL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \"  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1500px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%;\"><img id=\"gxifXMSKjVvr3QEbpbq5dU\" name=\"61XaCK7rYZL._AC_SL1500_\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gxifXMSKjVvr3QEbpbq5dU.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" credit=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Sleek, compact and with 24 double-ended bits crammed inside, the Hoto 23-in-1 precision screwdriver should be in your 3D printer toolkit.<a class=\"view-deal button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/HOTO-Screwdriver-Precision-Electronics-Bracelets/dp/B08X6WNPLL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-dimension112=\"4a8bcccc-8e9b-4b6e-a0a6-f2cb628fd2c0\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"Sleek, compact and with 24 double-ended bits crammed inside, the Hoto 23-in-1 precision screwdriver should be in your 3D printer toolkit.\" data-dimension48=\"Sleek, compact and with 24 double-ended bits crammed inside, the Hoto 23-in-1 precision screwdriver should be in your 3D printer toolkit.\" data-dimension25=\"$14.99\">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id=\"i-have-the-power-to-screw-unscrew-things-with-no-effort-2\">I have the power!

I bought this screwdriver with my own money and I use it almost every day. Heck I even <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.printables.com/model/876212-electronic-screwdriver-magnetic-charger-holder\">designed a cradle</a> that hangs the screwdriver from my IKEA shelves while connected to a charger via a magnetic cable. This is a great screwdriver and well worth the money.</p><p>The S2 bits are made from a hardened steel which means they won’t chew up and lose their edge. The bits are standard 4mm size, so you can use bits from your other precision screwdriver. The Hoto precision driver only has one speed and the battery capacity is only 350mAh, which provides around 500 operations, but those two things are its only downside. When charging the unit will show a white light next to the USB C port. When it goes out you are fully charged.</p><p>The driver is made from metal and the ridges help grip the driver as you work. Button operation is easy; just press and hold to screw / unscrew. The included case is lovely, if a little bulky. I ended up <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.printables.com/model/878508-magnetic-screwdriver-bit-holder\">3D printing a magnetic stand</a> for the bits to accompany the cradle that supports the driver.</p><p>All in all, a great electric screwdriver for makers, tinkerers and those eager to service their 3D printers.</p><h2 id=\"unclog-your-3d-printer-like-a-plastic-plumber-2\">Unclog your 3D printer like a plastic plumber</h2><p>3D printers will get clogged. No matter how much money you spend, hot plastic being pushed through a 0.4mm hole is going to cause a clog someday. Dealing with a clog is fairly simple, but you need the right tools as you will be poking around the hot end while it is well and truly hot, around 200C.</p><p>Poking a clog with a thin needle works most times, but when you absolutely, positively need to blast that clog out, the Creality Clog Poke (yes, that is its name) is there to help. Instead of inserting it into the nozzle, we insert the poke into the filament path, specifically the path from the top of the extruder to the nozzle. The 1.5mm needle won’t reach the nozzle, but it will push any plastic trapped inside the extruder. Molten plastic should then pour down onto the build plate.</p><p>Using this should reduce the need to completely disassemble the extruder, and make quick work of a blockage. Of course there will be times when you need to disassemble the extruder. About a year ago I had to disassemble the extruder on my Elego Neptune 3 Pro as it had a serious clog. Some pliers and a lot of time later, I was printing again. Perhaps with this tool it wouldn’t have been such a big job?</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"f14f178f-fdb2-4cca-a0c8-b2e1bad046b3\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"Tackle a blocked nozzle from another angle with the Creality Clog Poke.

But the best part for me are the two nozzle wrenches. Designed with an L-shape, they keep your fingers away from the hot bit, and give you a little more torque to persuade the nozzle to come loose.</p><p>Even after heating the nozzle, it can become stuck, so a little extra force is needed to remove it. The problem is that the heat makes the nozzle too hot to touch. The nozzle is cupped by the wrench, so you just need to concentrate on removing it. Then, drop it on the build plate to cool off.</p><p>The extra tools are useful. In fact the brass brushes are extremely useful to clean burnt plastic from the hot end, and I used them to remove a little rust from a long lost pocket knife.</p><h2 id=\"finish-your-prints-like-a-pro-2\">Finish your prints like a pro</h2><p>Yes, you can just use a scalpel / knife to remove the brim, or neaten up the edges. But, take it from someone who sliced the top of their finger off, buy a deburring tool instead. Some 3D prints need a little post-processing. The edges may need to be cleaned up, common when using a brim for bed adhesion, or if your print squeezed down on the print bed a little too hard and caused an “elephant’s foot”. A deburring tool uses a curved blade with a ball-end. The ball traces the contours of the object, while the blade shaves off a little plastic to neaten up your work.</p><p>So what do you get for the money? Firstly, an aluminum handle which feels light and strong. Next we have lots of spare blades, which are easily replaced via a quick change system. The AFA deburring tool is more expensive than the $2 version, but it is built to last!<br>This is the deburring tool that I bought and it has been a lifesaver.</p><p>I printed some parts in PETG and left the brim option to “auto” then realised I had to cut out so much waste plastic. But there was no problem with this tool. A few minutes later I had a bin of plastic shavings and a clean print. I also learnt an important lesson, don’t trust the auto brim option.</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"b2cf73f2-fc55-4fb6-943b-48c26d295b4b\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"This is the deburring tool that I personally use and it has been stellar since day one.

So let's get some IPA and clean up our act!</p><p>I buy IPA in bulk, seriously. I use it to clean my 3D printers, tools and even my PC case, when it's not full of dust. I dispense it into dollar store spray bottles, the ones used when traveling. I mark the bottle to identify it as IPA and just grab it when I need it. Yes, 99% is overkill, heck its medical grade for first aid use, but if you really want to eke it out, get some distilled water and water down your mix to 70%. I don’t because it works well as it is. My top tip though is to not spray it when the print bed is hot. There is very little risk of fire, but it will evaporate rather quickly.</p><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"ba1f5a91-2cc8-462b-b993-ef764a1bd1d4\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"Buying in bulk and decanting into dollar store spray bottles is the smart way to get all the IPA that you need.\" data-dimension48=\"Buying in bulk and decanting into dollar store spray bottles is the smart way to get all the IPA that you need.\" data-dimension25=\"$6\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sanigo-Isopropyl-Alcohol-Technical-Unscented/dp/B0DJ3M2QHJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \"  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:694px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:216.14%;\"><img id=\"AfP2YEfLzPo8eZ9ZLffebJ\" name=\"image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AfP2YEfLzPo8eZ9ZLffebJ.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"694\" height=\"1500\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" credit=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Buying in bulk and decanting into dollar store spray bottles is the smart way to get all the IPA that you need.<a class=\"view-deal button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sanigo-Isopropyl-Alcohol-Technical-Unscented/dp/B0DJ3M2QHJ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-dimension112=\"ba1f5a91-2cc8-462b-b993-ef764a1bd1d4\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"Buying in bulk and decanting into dollar store spray bottles is the smart way to get all the IPA that you need.\" data-dimension48=\"Buying in bulk and decanting into dollar store spray bottles is the smart way to get all the IPA that you need.\" data-dimension25=\"$6\">View Deal</a></p></div><h2 id=\"an-illuminating-purchase-2\">An illuminating purchase</h2><p>How the heck did a flashlight get on the list?

It produces clean, detailed prints at very high speed. Best of all, it is exceptionally easy to use, lowering the entry barrier so that anyone can start 3D printing.</p><p>The direct drive extruder makes short work of many types of filament, including even the most challenging ones, such as TPU. The 256 x 256 x 256 build volume is generous, and automatic bed leveling makes setting up your printer a breeze. </p><p>Now add an AMS, a multi-material system that can be used to create multi-color prints, or for those who favor function over form, multi-material prints that take advantage of each filament's properties.</p><p>For under $500, the Bambu Lab A1 Combo is a great deal, and you should take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/bambu-lab-a1-review\" data-dimension112=\"8b086cc3-efc5-41cb-9491-ab0da89924bd\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"review\" data-dimension48=\"review\" data-dimension25=\"$499\">review</a> and grab yourself a bargain.<a class=\"view-deal button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Multi-Color-Precision-Full-Auto-Calibration-Compensation/dp/B0D17V4SKM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-dimension112=\"8b086cc3-efc5-41cb-9491-ab0da89924bd\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"review\" data-dimension48=\"review\" data-dimension25=\"$499\">View Deal</a></p></div><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"8fb4f1de-d4c4-4be2-b2ca-40fc57b56202\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"review\" data-dimension48=\"review\" data-dimension25=\"$1039\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Original-Removable-Beginner-Friendly-Automatic-Calibration/dp/B0FKNGJPK2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \"  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1125px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%;\"><img id=\"jsaqTm9Mt8CPsiie9hrj8P\" name=\"image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jsaqTm9Mt8CPsiie9hrj8P.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1125\" height=\"1125\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" credit=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Prusa 3D printers are the Rolls-Royce of 3D printers, and the Core One is an excellent 3D printer that we awarded the Tom's Hardware Editor's Choice in our <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/3d-printing/prusa-core-one-review\" data-dimension112=\"8fb4f1de-d4c4-4be2-b2ca-40fc57b56202\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"review\" data-dimension48=\"review\" data-dimension25=\"$1039\">review</a>.</p><p>The Core One is a Core XY 3D printer. Rather than move the print bed around (bed slinger), the print head moves around the X and Y axes. As each layer is printed, the print bed moves down (Z axis), creating the print. This gives the Prusa One incredible stability, and that produces great quality prints at high speed. Every first layer is perfect!</p><p>The build volume is 250 x 210 x 270 mm, and the enclosed design means that you can print big and with exotic filaments that are prone to warping during open-air printing. You can print in PLA, PETG, TPU, ABS, ASA, and Polycarbonate.</p><p>Send your prints over Wi-Fi via PrusaSlicer, and rest assured that they will come out great. This is a great printer for beginners and for the career maker who needs a reliable workhorse!<a class=\"view-deal button\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Original-Removable-Beginner-Friendly-Automatic-Calibration/dp/B0FKNGJPK2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-dimension112=\"8fb4f1de-d4c4-4be2-b2ca-40fc57b56202\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"review\" data-dimension48=\"review\" data-dimension25=\"$1039\">View Deal</a></p></div><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-anycubic-deals\"><span>Anycubic Deals</span></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://store.anycubic.com/products/photon-mono-m7\">Anycubic Photon Mono M7 for $279</a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.anycubic.com/products/kobra-3-combo\">Anycubic Kobra 3 Combo for $349</a></li><li><a href=\"https://store.anycubic.com/products/wash-cure-3-plus\">Anycubic Wash & Cure 3 Plus now $159</a></li></ul><div class=\"product\"><a data-dimension112=\"12e8c3a0-0d00-4839-9bec-bca4c49d2c81\" data-action=\"Deal Block\" data-label=\"full review\" data-dimension48=\"full review\" data-dimension25=\"$599\" href=\"https://store.anycubic.com/products/photon-mono-m7-max\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><figure class=\"van-image-figure \"  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1500px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:100.00%;\"><img id=\"CJjQKSfytooU5dNG56JFHm\" name=\"image\" caption=\"\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJjQKSfytooU5dNG56JFHm.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" credit=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div></figure></a><p>With its amazing speed and a huge build volume, the Anycubic Photon Mono M7 Max produces high-quality prints in just a fraction of the time it takes other machines. You can print entire armies of gaming miniatures or full-sized sculptures with excellent detail using ordinary resin. If you want to crank up the speed, switching to a thinner high-speed resin will let the machine run twice as fast.</p><p>The massive 298 x 164 x 300mm build volume is incredible for a resin (SLA) 3D printer, and the print speed is exceptional.

Key points covered in the video, embedded below, are that there are now around 20,000 objects tracked orbiting the Earth. Of these, 12,000 are working satellites, including 8,000 that form SpaceX’s Starlink constellation. In 2025, we are seeing a “couple of satellite re-entries a day,” with things only going to get worse, while several companies/nations have plans for thousands more satellites.</p><div class=\"youtube-video\" data-nosnippet ><div class=\"video-aspect-box\"><iframe data-lazy-priority=\"low\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQCkuykE6Mk\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Host Dave Adalian ruminated on the topic of overcrowded skies with Jonathan McDowell, currently staff scientist at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.</p><p>Adalian put it to McDowell that a spate of social media posts showing Starlink satellites burning in the skies shows there is a growing risk from satellite debris. The storied astrophysicist didn’t brush off the host’s concerns as unfounded and agreed, “it's getting pretty busy up there.” He measuredly explained that the risks today, especially from Starlink satellites, are low. However, McDowell called for some kind of global regulation and coordination to keep us Earth dwellers safe.</p><h2 id=\"how-crowded-is-leo-2\">How crowded is LEO?</h2><p>As noted, there are currently have about 12,000 satellites up in LEO (Low Earth Orbit), around 8,000 of which are Starlink.</p><p>Other than these, there are a growing number of satellites from Western firms like Amazon. Jeff Bezos’ rockets have put ~100 into space, with thousands more planned. Another Western firm, ESpace, is reportedly yet to get its satellite roster into double figures, but has posted filings indicating it wants several hundred thousand satellites in LEO.</p><p>Then there are nations like China, which want an independent communications system in orbit. One Chinese company has already launched over 100 satellites. It is thought China is likely to contribute tens of thousands more to the skies in due course.</p><p>In the same or similar orbit, McDowell notes there are also about “a million centimeter-sized fragments” that are not tracked.</p><h2 id=\"why-are-satellites-failing-falling-2\">Why are satellites failing / falling?</h2><p>According to the astrophysicist being interviewed, a commercial satellite will work as intended for a median of about five years. Then they are retired, and their orbits are lowered. Eventually, the atmosphere drags them in the rest of the way, before they re-enter “at an unpredictable location.” The bad thing is, they can and do sometimes drop debris over a populous area…</p><h2 id=\"kessler-syndrome-2\">Kessler Syndrome</h2><p>In the 70s, scientist Don Kessler warned that too many satellites in a similar orbit could cause a chain reaction of collisions and debris, causing further collisions. McDowell said that with all the mega constellations planned, and an unexpected big radiation event (for example), things “could get bad very quickly.” Moreover, there is a risk of this chain reaction being sparked by old space-age debris falling from higher orbits.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1200px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:80.25%;\"><img id=\"XFrNtggQHw4pxsYHVYgXQW\" name=\"satellite1\" alt=\"SpaceX Starlink satellites launching\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFrNtggQHw4pxsYHVYgXQW.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"963\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: SpaceX)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"starlink-satellites-are-probably-safer-than-some-others-2\">Starlink satellites are probably safer than some others</h2><p>As for SpaceX Starlink heavenly bodies, McDowell explained that these comms satellites are typically 30m in length (~100ft) and weigh up to a ton. You wouldn't want one of these landing in your backyard, but they are designed to completely burn up on reentry. It is possible that some small stray components/material might end up hitting Earth, though.</p><p>The astrophysicist said that you can usually tell the difference between a meteor and a satellite in the night sky, as fast-moving fireballs are usually meteors, but those moving “in a more stately way” are likely satellites breaking up. This breakup and burning takes place from about 40 miles up – 4x higher than a plane, and much faster.</p><p>This contrasts with some recent Chinese space junk atmosphere re-entry examples.

Unfortunately, it seems that the argument was lost in the South Korean government, as the institution <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.chosun.com/english/national-en/2025/10/02/FPWGFSXMLNCFPIEGWKZF3BOQ3M/\" target=\"_blank\">has completely lost</a> the sizable amount of 858 terabytes of data, with 0 bytes of backups.</p><p>The event happened on September 26 and was <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/battery-fire-at-south-koreas-state-data-center-brings-government-services-offline/\" target=\"_blank\">caused by a battery fire</a> at the National Information Resources Service datacenter in Daejeon, burning up 384 battery packs, the majority of one floor, and taking down 96 government systems. While 95 of those had backups, the G-Drive system (no relation to Google Drive), used primarily but not only by the Ministry of Personnel Management, did not.</p><p>In total, it's estimated that roughly 17% of central government officials are affected, and roughly eight years' worth of data was lost. The fire promptly brought down government email, online post office, websites, complaints and petition services, and even the national 119 emergency service. A full recovery should take about a month, as reportedly the affected teams are having trouble even figuring out which specific data was lost. As of October 4, it was estimated that only 17.8% of services were back online.</p><p>While a datacenter fire is an event that can happen anywhere at any time, it's more than a little puzzling to find that the G-Drive data was lost because, according to an unnamed source, \"[it] couldn't have a backup due to its large capacity.\"</p><p>858 terabytes is a big number for a household, but barely registers in the scale of datacenter storage, where entire petabytes are doled out like candy. This fact is even stranger, as South Korea is seen as a highly technologically advanced country, being the home of Samsung and other conglomerates known as <em>chaebol</em>.</p><p>G-Drive is a document sharing platform, similar to Google Drive. Each employee's default quota on the system was 30 GB, and users were instructed to keep their data there instead of in the office computers, as should be the policy everywhere... when there are backups. There's also a certain irony in the fact that the more vintage systems were then ones whose data survived.</p><p>While the fire itself apparently caused no casualties, one government worker overseeing the data recovery sadly <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.donga.com/en/article/all/20251004/5885938/1\" target=\"_blank\">took his own life</a> by jumping off the Central Building in Sejong's Government Complex on October 3. Four people <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/four-arrests-over-south-korea-data-center-fire/\" target=\"_blank\">have been arrested</a> in connection with the fire, reportedly under suspicion of criminal negligence.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em> to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

Usage of the latest production node could give AMD a major advantage when competing against Nvidia's upcoming Rubin GPUs and systems on their base, which are set to be made on N3.</p><p>\"We are really excited about our MI450 generation, it has 2nm technology, so the most advanced fabrication capability, it has rack scale solutions, so we are really putting all of these compute elements together,\" Lisa Su, chief executive of AMD, revealed in an interview with <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prv2hbD3erU\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Yahoo Finance</em></a>. \"The way to think about it is it takes a village to build this all. So, you know, we are of course very, you know, proud and focused.\"</p><p>AMD's current-generation CDNA 4-based Instinct MI350-series AI accelerators use compute chiplets produced by TSMC using one of its proven N3-series fabrication technologies (which entered mass production in late 2022), so it is reasonable for the company to transit to a 2nm-class manufacturing process for its next-generation GPUs for AI and HPC applications. AMD's Instinct MI450-series accelerators will be the company's first processors tailored specifically for AI and, therefore, support appropriate data formats and instructions. Perhaps, a new node will enable AMD to pack in some secret sauce into its new compute GPUs.</p><p>Indeed, N2 promises tangible — as TSMC calls them 'full node' — improvements compared to predecessors, such as a 10% to 15% performance improvement at the same power or complexity, or a 25% to 30% power reduction at the same frequency, along with a 15% increase in transistor density compared to N3E. The key advantage of the new production node will be gate-all-around (GAA) transistors that enable developers to tailor designs for maximum efficiency when using design and technology co-optimization (DTCO). Overall, by migrating to N2, AMD will obtain a broad set of benefits that include performance efficiency and transistor density.</p><p>Nvidia has already announced that its next-generation Rubin GPUs will be produced using one of TSMC's N3 technologies (presumably N3P tailored for Nvidia's needs), so AMD's Instinct MI450 will have an edge over its key rival when it comes to manufacturing process. <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-says-instinct-mi400x-gpu-is-10x-faster-than-mi300x-will-power-helios-rack-scale-system-with-epyc-venice-cpus\">AMD's Helios rack-scale solution</a> with 72 Instinct MI450 GPUs will also carry more HBM4 memory (31TB vs 21TB) and offer more memory bandwidth (1,400 TB/s vs 936 TB/s) compared to Nvidia's Rubin-based NVL144 machine. However, Nvidia's next-generation rack-scale solution will offer tangibly higher FP4 (well, NVFP4) performance compared to AMD's Helios (3,600 PFLOPS vs 2,900 PFLOPS), so it remains to be seen which of the systems will be faster and more power efficient, especially given uncertainties with UALink scale-up interconnections for the Instinct MI450-series GPUs.</p><p>One of the first customers to adopt AMD's Instinct MI450 is said to be OpenAI, which will start to get the hardware in the second half of next year, with AMD revenue ramping sharply afterward. The project will unfold over multiple phases and should generate double-digit billions in incremental sales once fully operational, according to Su.

It also walked us through the improvements and expected performance of its new Xe3 graphics architecture, which is coming to market in the form of two integrated GPU tiles for Panther Lake. For more details on the three primary configurations of Panther Lake SoCs, as well as a more general overview of Panther Lake's CPU resources, <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-takes-the-wraps-off-panther-lake-first-18a-client-processor-brings-the-best-of-lunar-lake-and-arrow-lake-together-in-one-package\" target=\"_blank\">check out our dedicated article. </a></p><p>First things first: Intel emphasized that Xe3 is not based on the Celestial architecture, even though its name conveniently maps to that codename's place in Intel's past roadmaps. Let us repeat: this is not Celestial. Intel classifies Xe3 GPUs as part of the Battlemage family because the capabilities the chip presents to software are similar to those of existing Xe2 products. Therefore, it will include Panther Lake iGPUs under the Arc B-series umbrella. The company admits this naming scheme isn't ideal, but it appears to be the least worst option for the time being.</p><p>Indeed, once you start digging into the changes Intel highlights for Xe3, you'll see that it's more of a continuous improvement of the existing Battlemage architectural lineage than an all-new design. The next \"clean\" generational leap will come with Xe3P Arc GPUs, but it's unclear when those parts will arrive. Intel was understandably mum about Xe3P products during the Panther Lake event.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-the-building-blocks\"><span>The building blocks </span></h3><p>The basic Xe3 Xe Core (henceforth Xe3 Core) keeps the same basic layout of Xe2: eight Xe Vector Engines for floating-point and integer math, eight XMX engines for acceleration of matrix math for AI applications, and one ray-tracing unit. Intel says the changes within Xe3 are meant to improve two pain points: better utilization of available resources, an ongoing project for Arc GPUs, and making the architecture more scalable, which is important for building larger and higher-performance products.</p><p>The prior Xe2 render slice included up to four Xe Cores, from which graphics processors as small as Lunar Lake's iGPU (two render slices) and as large as the Arc B580 (five render slices) were all constructed.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1276px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.27%;\"><img id=\"qFFLzto6DTYVP7dn456oML\" name=\"xe3-rs\" alt=\"The Intel Xe3 render slice\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qFFLzto6DTYVP7dn456oML.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1276\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Xe3 render slice, on the other hand, starts with six Xe Cores, and it's been used to make two iGPUs so far.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1280px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:55.78%;\"><img id=\"EvDDLWxUkLAszC9PjikXaj\" name=\"12xe3\" alt=\"The 12Xe3 iGPU for Panther Lake\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvDDLWxUkLAszC9PjikXaj.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1280\" height=\"714\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The headliner is the two-render-slice, 12 Xe3 Core part that will power gaming, content creation, and AI workloads in the highest-performance variant of the Panther Lake SoC.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1280px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:55.94%;\"><img id=\"uCdoLUbmkiNsNRpH9nHYPe\" name=\"4xe3\" alt=\"The 4Xe3 core iGPU for Panther Lake\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCdoLUbmkiNsNRpH9nHYPe.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1280\" height=\"716\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other is a four-Xe3-Core part that provides graphics functionality on lower-end Panther Lake products.</p><p>Observant readers may be wondering why, given that an Xe3 render slice starts with six Xe Cores, the smaller Xe3 GPU on Panther Lake only includes four Xe Cores. Intel has always maintained a level of fine-grained control over the size of its graphics engines (stretching well into the pre-Arc days) to meet various product demands, so even if Xe3 starts with six Xe Cores per render slice, it's no surprise that it can be scaled down.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-improvements-large-and-small\"><span>Improvements large and small</span></h3><p>Intel says each Xe3 Xe Core can keep up to 25% more threads in flight - from eight to 10 - versus its predecessor, and the core can variably allocate partitions of each Xe Vector Engine's register file per thread in order to achieve better utilization.</p><p>Variable register allocation is truly new to Xe3. Previous Arc GPUs used a coarser per-thread register allocation strategy that posed challenges for fully utilizing the core's available resources. Intel says this is a key improvement in the Xe3 architecture and says that it has \"dramatic effects on performance.\"</p><p>One of Xe3's other big structural changes — at least for an Arc iGPU — is an increase in shared local memory per Xe core. Xe3 now includes 256KB of shared local memory, up from 192KB in Xe2 on Lunar Lake and the improved Xe-LPG architecture on Meteor Lake. Intel says that workloads spilling out of this shared local memory is a major reason for performance pitfalls on older Arc iGPUs, so adding more of it is a sensible and relatively simple architectural refinement with a major performance payoff.</p><p>It's worth noting that this change simply brings Xe3 iGPUs in line with the basic resources offered by desktop Xe2 products. The Arc B580 and B5700 already had 256KB of local memory per Xe Core, so don't expect performance miracles from this increase. The fact that Intel is adding more local memory here probably shows that the size of this structure on Battlemage discrete GPUs was the right decision and one worthy of carrying through the Arc B-series graphics stack.</p><p>More big changes occur further out in the cache hierarchy. In its largest 12-Xe-Core configuration, Panther Lake's Arc GPU now sports 16MB of shared L2 cache, double that of Lunar Lake's eight-Xe-Core graphics engine. This is an absolutely massive L2 for a GPU of this size; the Arc B580, by comparison, only sports 18MB (or 12.5% more) L2 for a chip with 67% more Xe Cores to feed.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1275px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.16%;\"><img id=\"TqYWgPi2iUDYFiTvQMHize\" name=\"cache-fabric-pressure\" alt=\"A slide demonstrating the effects of L2 cache capacity on Panther Lake on-chip fabric traffic\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TqYWgPi2iUDYFiTvQMHize.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1275\" height=\"716\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Intel says a larger L2 cache reduces traffic on Panther Lake's on-package fabric that connects the graphics processor to main memory - an important consideration for an integrated graphics processor that might be contending with a CPU and NPU for access to RAM. Intel showed a chart claiming anywhere from a 17% to 36% reduction in fabric traffic compared to a product with an 8MB L2 as a baseline.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1275px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.16%;\"><img id=\"G7gBZRNp9iAn3TpvERFev6\" name=\"architectural-improvements\" alt=\"A slide showing all Xe3 architectural improvements\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G7gBZRNp9iAn3TpvERFev6.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1275\" height=\"716\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xe3 also features a number of smaller, but still important, refinements. Xe2's ray tracing engine allows for asynchronous evaluation of ray-triangle intersection, but the results of those tests have to be resolved in order. That responsibility falls to a thread sorting unit that could previously cause backups in the ray-tracing pipeline. Intel says the improved ray tracing engine in Xe3 can dynamically slow down dispatch of new rays while the sorting unit catches up to work in flight.</p><p>Intel also increased the performance of a cache called the Unified Return Buffer, or URB, which is a means of passing data between functional units on the GPU. The company equipped the Xe3 URB with a new management agent that can make partial updates to this buffer without requiring a full flush for each context switch, lowering the cost of cross-functional-unit communication.</p><p>Xe3 also includes improvements to fixed-function hardware in order to improve performance in some common graphics tasks. The company says to expect up to 2x the anisotropic filtering rate, and up to a 2x improvement in stencil test rate.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1274px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.28%;\"><img id=\"QCYqgmoa8TTKoVsnfdyiJR\" name=\"microbenchmarks\" alt=\"Intel Xe3 microbenchmarks\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QCYqgmoa8TTKoVsnfdyiJR.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1274\" height=\"717\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a range of proprietary microarchitectural benchmarks versus the Xe2 GPU on Lunar Lake, you can see that the performance of the 12 Xe3 Core GPU in some operations hasn't changed between Xe2 and Xe3, simply because the available resources per render slice haven't grown. Intel demonstrates that some other operations have scaled linearly with the 50% increase in Xe Cores from Lunar Lake to Panther Lake's 12 Xe configuration.</p><p>Operations like ray-triangle intersection tests, anisotropic filtering, mesh rendering, and scattered reads from memory, start to demonstrate microarchitectural as well as scaling improvements in Xe3; they all enjoy 2x or better speedups relative to Xe2.</p><p>For shaders that place a large amount of pressure on registers, Xe3's dynamic register allocation can deliver anywhere from 1.9x to 3.1x faster performance in Intel's internal microbenchmarks. Depth testing operations—an incredibly important and fundamental part of the modern render pipeline—enjoy anywhere from a 1.9x to an incredible 7.4x speedup.</p><p>Intel isn't talking about detailed specs like clock speeds for Xe3 GPUs just yet, but the company did provide a set of ballpark power-versus-performance plots that are typical of early looks at silicon.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1277px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.46%;\"><img id=\"z8yU5uSnPoq73fp5yySyX\" name=\"Xe3 perf\" alt=\"Intel Xe3 performance scaling\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8yU5uSnPoq73fp5yySyX.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1277\" height=\"721\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first claim shows that the 12 Xe Core GPU has a much broader range of scaling than Lunar Lake. If given a large amount of extra power over Lunar Lake, the 12 Xe Core Arc GPU can offer 50% or greater performance in exchange. If we eyeball the same power level as Lunar Lake in this chart, performance gains are much more modest, but still present.</p><p>When discussing performance-per-watt improvements, Intel instead points to the Arrow Lake-H iGPU, against which the company claims a greater than 40% improvement in efficiency for the same performance. We would certainly hope that Panther Lake provides a performance-per-watt improvement in this match-up, as the Arrow Lake-H iGPU is based on the aging Xe-LPG architecture that first made its debut in the almost two-year-old Meteor Lake and has its roots in the three-year-old Alchemist architecture.</p><p>If you directly compare Panther Lake to Lunar Lake for efficiency, Xe3 still delivers a performance-per-watt improvement, but it's smaller (probably under 20%, if we had to eyeball it). Gripes about relevant comparisons aside, what we should take away here is that the Lunar Lake iGPU (at least in its 12 Xe Core form) delivers both performance per watt improvements and a broader range of performance scaling possibilities compared to the company's past integrated GPU efforts.</p><p>What is impressive, however, is that these improvements have all come by way of architectural refinements. Intel says it hasn't changed the process technology it's using to fabricate the GPU tile (presumably relative to Arrow Lake), so these boosts to both power and performance come exclusively from the architectural improvements discussed above.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1278px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.18%;\"><img id=\"LGrNkdrjxbxHPmptnzFaPA\" name=\"xe3-frame-time\" alt=\"Cumulative frame time graphs showing much higher performance on Xe3 vs Xe2\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGrNkdrjxbxHPmptnzFaPA.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1278\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another way Intel talks about performance with Xe3 is by walking through the time it takes for a hypothetical frame to be rendered on both Lunar Lake and Panther Lake. As any graphics performance enthusiast knows, a lower frame time on average means higher frame rates. One frame isn't terribly useful as a benchmark, but Intel's trip inside the frame time journey shows several key improvements related to the microarchitectural refinements in Xe3. Overall, this same frame renders in 22.84 ms on the 12 Xe3-Core GPU, or 50% less time.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-going-hands-on-with-xe-multi-frame-generation\"><span>Going hands-on with Xe Multi Frame Generation</span></h3><p>Of course, GPUs these days aren't just a chip - they're part of an entire hardware-software stack. Intel is continuing to invest in its XeSS suite of technologies to keep pace with Nvidia and AMD. On top of upscaling and 2x framegen support in XeSS 2, an upcoming XeSS release will add AI-accelerated multi-frame generation to Intel’s arsenal.</p><p>Like Nvidia’s DLSS Multi-Frame Generation, XeSS MFG will offer 2x, 3x, and 4x modes (one, two, or three generated frames). It also won’t require game developers to update their XeSS 2 titles to explicitly support the feature.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1278px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:55.95%;\"><img id=\"3hhBHBxSDWecm9ZWf397db\" name=\"XeSS MFG\" alt=\"Intel XeSS MFG pipeline\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3hhBHBxSDWecm9ZWf397db.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1278\" height=\"715\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Any of the (small) list of titles that already support Xe Frame Generation will work with XeSS MFG through an override in the Intel Graphics Software control panel.</p><p>We had an opportunity to go hands-on with XeSS Multi Frame Generation on a Panther Lake engineering system at the Tech Tour event. Based on my limited time with the demo system, the image quality of XeMFG is impressive. I didn't see any distracting artifacts that would have given the framegen-boosted frame rate away.</p><p>However, input lag was just a bit too far over the line of tolerability for a great experience in a fast-paced shooter like the upcoming Painkiller, although I'm sure I could have tuned upscaling and quality settings to arrive at a more responsive experience.</p><p>I was somewhat frustrated by Intel’s use of baseline frame rates as a proxy for acceptable input lag with XeMFG.

Going by past Intel launch cycles, we're likely to hear more about these chips at CES 2026. Intel says \"broad market availability\" will start in January 2026.</p><p>These sorts of improvements are badly needed because, in recent years, Intel has faced a triple threat in the laptop processor market. AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple all want a piece of the lucrative premium laptop pie, and especially in the case of Qualcomm and Apple, the arrival of high-performance, highly efficient Arm cores on SoCs boasting powerful NPUs and GPUs has forced Intel to up every part of its game to stay competitive on performance and battery life.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-details-core-ultra-meteor-lake-architecture-launches-december-14\">Meteor Lake</a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unwraps-lunar-lake-architecture-up-to-68-ipc-gain-for-e-cores-16-ipc-gain-for-p-cores\">Lunar Lake</a> Core Ultra CPUs proved that relatively short battery life wasn't an inherent problem of Intel x86 products, but the highly integrated design of Lunar Lake SoCs (combining both compute and memory on a single package) meant that laptop OEMs didn't have nearly as much flexibility and control over system configurations and costs as they might get with a Meteor Lake or <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-launches-arrow-lake-core-ultra-200s-big-gains-in-productivity-and-power-efficiency-but-not-in-gaming\">Arrow Lake</a> CPU and discrete memory packages, whether in soldered or SO-DIMM flavors.</p><p>In exchange for that greater flexibility in memory configurations, Arrow Lake-H SoCs come with tradeoffs of their own. Arrow Lake systems certainly don't have bad battery life, but Lunar Lake is still the best thing going for unplugged efficiency from Intel CPUs.</p><p>Lunar Lake also includes a GPU built on Intel's latest Xe2 graphics architecture, while Arrow Lake-H CPUs use an older, larger Xe-LPG+ GPU, which has its roots in first-gen Arc Alchemist products, to deliver relatively similar performance (but likely with worse power efficiency).</p><p>Arrow Lake-H also carries over Meteor Lake's rather limited pair of Crestmont E-cores in its low-power island, even as its on-die E-cores got an upgrade to the more advanced Skymont microarchitecture that also underpins the quartet of low-power E-cores on Lunar Lake. Are you lost yet?</p><p>This dizzying mix of performance levels, power efficiency targets, architectural generations, and system configuration restrictions across Intel mobile platforms is a headache for consumers and laptop makers alike.</p><p>Enter Panther Lake, the great unifier that Intel hopes will bring the best of Lunar Lake's power efficiency improvements and Arrow Lake's performance scalability together in one common package.</p><p>Panther Lake SoCs are all built up from the same cutting-edge P-cores, E-cores, and iGPU architecture, while affording laptop makers more freedom to tailor their products to a wider range of buyers and price points.

Here’s the story so far.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-intel-s-18a-process-ramps-up\"><span>Intel's 18A process ramps up</span></h3><p>Panther Lake's compute tile is one of the first products to be fabricated on Intel's leading-edge 18A node. As a quick refresher, 18A is Intel's (and likely the industry's) first high-volume process to incorporate two major innovations meant to enable future scaling and power efficiency gains: gate-all-around (GAA) transistors, which Intel calls RibbonFETs, and a backside power delivery network, which Intel calls PowerVia.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1317px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.34%;\"><img id=\"zfueeQpXmfxkSm9yr3Zwfn\" name=\"ribbonfet\" alt=\"A slide showing details of Intel's RibbonFET transistor\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zfueeQpXmfxkSm9yr3Zwfn.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1317\" height=\"742\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Intel describes its RibbonFETs as \"the ultimate transistor,\" since their gate structure allows for what the company calls \"complete control\" over the channel. Compared to FinFETs, whose gate structure doesn't extend to the bottom of the channel and therefore has a \"weak point\" for controlling leakage current, the RibbonFET gate structure entirely wraps around the channel (as defined by the stack of silicon nanosheets at the heart of the device), minimizing undesirable leakage current when the transistor is off. Among other important characteristics, less leakage current means less energy wasted while a chip is operating.</p><p>Intel also claims that RibbonFETs are more flexible for designers than FinFETs. The number of ribbons, as well as their widths, can be adjusted to tailor the transistor's performance characteristics to the needs of a given cell.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1320px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.29%;\"><img id=\"qoSb7h5TEpfsEB7834583A\" name=\"powervia\" alt=\"A slide detailing the benefits of Intel PowerVia\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoSb7h5TEpfsEB7834583A.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1320\" height=\"743\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>PowerVia, Intel's implementation of a backside power delivery network, introduces a second novel approach to chip fabrication. As silicon processes have gotten denser and denser, efficiently routing both signal and power wires above the transistors has gotten more and more challenging as those wires compete for ever more precious real estate.</p><p>Instead of building up both power and signal wires above the transistor, the backside power delivery approach first creates the transistors and signal wiring on the front side of the wafer. In the next production step, the wafer gets flipped over, and the back side gets polished away until the transistor contacts are revealed. The power delivery metal layers are then connected directly to the transistors.</p><p>Intel says that PowerVia allows for 10% higher density and relaxed routing on the front side of the wafer. For power delivery, the back-side metal layers reduce power loss from the package to the transistor by 30%.</p><p>All in all, 18A allows for a 15% higher frequency at the same power as Intel 3 and a 1.3x density improvement compared to the same process. Designers can also choose to harness 18A's advances to deliver a 25% power reduction at the same performance level compared to Intel 3.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-cougar-cove-p-cores-and-darkmont-e-cores-evolution-not-revolution\"><span>Cougar Cove P-cores and Darkmont E-cores: evolution, not revolution</span></h3><p>Intel didn't go into fine detail on the changes it made to the Cougar Cove P-core on Panther Lake versus Lunar and Arrow Lake's <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unwraps-lunar-lake-architecture-up-to-68-ipc-gain-for-e-cores-16-ipc-gain-for-p-cores/2\">Lion Cove</a>, or Panther's Darkmont E-core versus Skymont. The improvements the company did discuss for the Cougar Cove P-core are typical refinements of an existing CPU architecture, such as an improved branch predictor and a more capacious translation lookaside buffer (TLB). As Intel says, \"we didn't go in and change the width, we didn't change the depth, we optimized.\"</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1277px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.23%;\"><img id=\"2dGyM9hFmPZrTtwdU9UURf\" name=\"CougarCove\" alt=\"An overview of the Cougar Cove P-Core on Panther Lake\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2dGyM9hFmPZrTtwdU9UURf.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1277\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At a high level, Intel says that Cougar Cove now employs an \"AI-based\" power management approach that can adjust the aggressiveness of certain functional units, such as the prefetcher, on the fly in response to the demands of diverse workloads.</p><p>Another change in Cougar Cove is improved prediction behavior in some cases of memory disambiguation. As Intel puts it, when a processor is executing a program, it will perform load and store instructions for memory accesses; sometimes those instructions are connected. Cougar Cove has improved logic to predict when a load and store are connected and use that information to schedule the load correctly. When this prediction is correct, it can result in higher IPC.</p><p>Intel also notes that the move to the 18A process gave it the ability to grow some fundamental structures in Cougar Cove, and the TLB was one of the primary beneficiaries. A bigger TLB means that more complex workloads run faster and more reliably, according to Intel.</p><p>Cougar Cove also carries forward and refines branch prediction changes introduced with Lion Cove in Lunar Lake. Lion Cove featured improved branch prediction algorithms and delivered low-latency predictions even for branches far ahead in the instruction stream. Intel says Cougar Cove incorporates lessons it learned from shipping Lion Cove silicon to improve performance. It refined some branch prediction algorithms and grew the sizes of each level in the predictor to further lower latency. Cougar Cove can also store better metadata about past prediction results to improve accuracy.</p><p>Intel says this all means the Cougar Cove branch predictor can deliver lower latency, more prediction bandwidth, and higher prediction accuracy. These improvements positively impact energy efficiency and performance— a more accurate and more responsive predictor means the CPU core spends less time doing wasteful work and more time doing useful work.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1278px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.26%;\"><img id=\"xzpemuydDTu8XnqQN8mWDm\" name=\"Darkmont\" alt=\"An overview of the improvements of the Darkmont E-Core\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xzpemuydDTu8XnqQN8mWDm.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1278\" height=\"719\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Improvements in the Darkmont E-core are also largely evolutionary versus <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-unwraps-lunar-lake-architecture-up-to-68-ipc-gain-for-e-cores-16-ipc-gain-for-p-cores/3\">Lunar Lake’s Skymont</a>. As with Cougar Cove, Darkmont can now use a dynamic algorithm to adjust the aggressiveness of its prefetcher to better balance responsiveness and power efficiency in response to the demands of varying workloads.</p><p>Like Cougar Cove, Darkmont offers improved branch prediction accuracy. It also saves power in the front end by employing loop stream detection, a technique that allows the front end of the chip to power down during certain instruction sequences. Darkmont also broadens the cases where the chip can employ nanocode sequences to execute complex instructions that traditionally would have been handled by an x86 CPU's microcode engine. Nanocode was introduced in Skymont to improve both performance and power efficiency.</p><p>As Intel puts it, the microcode sequencer is a giant ROM that comes into play when certain complex x86 instructions need to be executed. Loading from that ROM is a serial process, and it can only service one decoder at a time, meaning that other front end units will be blocked if they were also to need instruction sequences from the microcode ROM at the same time. Nanocode prevents this blocking behavior by taking some of those microcode instructions and embedding them into programmable logic arrays in each of the three front-end decoders of the E-core.</p><p>Since those PLAs are present in each of the three front-ends of the Darkmont core, Intel says the core can run instructions that formerly resided in microcode as \"parallel, out-of-order microcode-like sequences.\" Intel says Darkmont has more cases and more optimized cases where its front-ends can employ nanocode and leave the microcode sequencer alone.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-mix-and-match\"><span>Mix and match</span></h3><p>Not every part of a Panther Lake SoC uses 18A, of course. Intel uses the same \"disaggregated architecture\" concept that debuted in Meteor Lake and was refined on Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake. This approach separates different functional units of an SoC into individually fabricated \"tiles\" that are made in Intel's own fabs or at foundries like TSMC, then joined together using Intel's Foveros packaging technology.</p><p>In turn, each Panther Lake compute tile, fabricated in-house on 18A, is built up from three basic core complexes. A compute tile can (so far) include up to four Cougar Cove P-cores, up to eight Darkmont E-cores, and a separate \"low-power island\" cluster of four more Darkmont E-cores that are meant to \"confine\" suitable workloads to a lower-power compute domain for extra battery life, an idea introduced in Meteor Lake and refined further in Lunar Lake.</p><p>Meteor Lake and Arrow Lake both relied on a pair of Crestmont E-cores in this island that were limited in both power and clock speeds to maximize energy savings, but their limited performance meant that more power-hungry parts of the chip might be awakened more often if a task exceeded their limited capabilities. Lunar Lake got four Skymont E-cores in this island with their own power rail, which allowed them to be clocked higher and do more demanding work before tasks had to be shifted to the P-cores on that SoC.</p><p>As an evolution of Skymont, Panther Lake's Darkmont low-power E-cores allow more demanding tasks to stay confined to the low-power island for longer, and they can contribute to multi-threaded workloads for extra parallelism when it's needed. They're not on the main ring bus that connects the main clusters of P- and E-cores on the Panther Lake SoC, however, so they don't share the L3 cache of the larger core cluster. Instead, they have access to a power-efficient 8MB \"memory-side cache\" that's shared with all the other compute agents on the tile.</p><p>This side cache is coherent with the rest of the cache hierarchy across the chip, and coherence among all the caches on Panther Lake is managed by a home agent that communicates with separate coherency agents on each compute domain.</p><p>The 18A compute tiles also include Intel's fifth-generation NPU, seventh-generation image processing unit (IPU) for use with premium webcams in laptops, and Xe media and display engines separated from the graphics tile.</p><p>For more information on the Xe3 graphics architecture and the two iGPUs that use it on Panther Lake, as well as software and power management improvements, check out our dedicated article.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-three-s-a-crowd\"><span>Three's a crowd</span></h3><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1278px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.18%;\"><img id=\"2BLYiwD3g9xHnrt3UK82UW\" name=\"PTLtrio\" alt=\"A slide detailing the three base Panther Lake SoC configs\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2BLYiwD3g9xHnrt3UK82UW.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1278\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So far, Intel has created two different 18A compute dies that it mixes and matches with two different integrated GPUs (and possibly two different I/O tiles) to create three distinct Panther Lake SoCs, each with different cost and performance targets.</p><p>The smallest Panther Lake SoC has four P-cores paired with four low-power E-cores, just like we saw with Lunar Lake. Intel didn't disclose the full specs of its cache hierarchy, but since it lacks higher-power E-core clusters with their own L3 cache, our educated guess is this chip likely only has 12MB of cache shared across its four P-cores. It includes a small Xe3 GPU that offers up to four Xe3 graphics cores.

Intel wouldn't comment on particular Panther Lake OEM designs in the pipeline, but between its expanded compute resources, richer PCIe connectivity, and support for higher-speed memory versus its smaller sibling, this chip seems well-suited for pairing with a discrete GPU in thin and light laptops, an approach that some Intel partners took with Meteor Lake chips.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1277px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.07%;\"><img id=\"Pm22DaJe9A92kPUbddssZ4\" name=\"bigPTL\" alt=\"The largest Panther Lake SoC\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pm22DaJe9A92kPUbddssZ4.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1277\" height=\"716\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The largest Panther Lake SoC retains the same 4P+8E+4LPE CPU core configuration as the midsize SoC but adds a much larger and more powerful 12 Xe3 Core GPU to the package. Intel restricts the memory options that partners can employ with this chip, likely so that it can get adequate memory bandwidth to feed all of those GPU execution units. It can only use LPDDR5X memory and supports the fastest transfer rates of any Panther Lake product: up to 9600 MT/s.</p><p>This big chip drops back to the more limited I/O tile with eight PCIe Gen 4 and four PCIe Gen 5 lanes, which is likely an indication that it's targeted at the exploding handheld gaming market and premium thin-and-light laptops that can still game when needed. Pairing discrete GPUs with this version of Panther Lake doesn't make a ton of sense from a system design standpoint.</p><h3 class=\"article-body__section\" id=\"section-performance-projections\"><span>Performance projections</span></h3><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1276px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.27%;\"><img id=\"u7TsnZwkDMYn3QyeeCe4Lc\" name=\"PTL1T\" alt=\"Panther Lake single threaded performance projections\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u7TsnZwkDMYn3QyeeCe4Lc.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"1\" width=\"1276\" height=\"718\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"expandable\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Intel offered a high-level preview of single-threaded performance with Cougar Cove, suggesting that the new P-core can deliver 10% higher performance at similar power to Lunar and Arrow Lake, or 40% lower power at similar performance in less demanding workloads.</p><p>The multi-threaded performance story for Panther Lake is a bit muddier.

Intel says that the first Panther Lake chips will ship before the end of 2025, and that it expects broad market availability starting in January 2026. Given that timeframe, it's probably safe to say that we will hear much more about Panther Lake products at CES.</p> ]]></dc:content>\n                                                                                                                                            <link>https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-takes-the-wraps-off-panther-lake-first-18a-client-processor-brings-the-best-of-lunar-lake-and-arrow-lake-together-in-one-package</link>\n                                                                            <description>\n                            <![CDATA[ Today, Intel is giving the world its first look at Panther Lake, its first family of laptop SoCs to incorporate cutting-edge 18A silicon.

The updated rules, which take effect in December, cover not just elements like holmium, thulium, erbium, and ytterbium, but also the technical know-how around how they’re turned into magnets.</p><p>In a mirror of U.S. semiconductor export policy, Chinese officials framed the move as a national security imperative and signaled that licenses will be denied for end-uses tied to defense or semiconductors. Under the new rules, which are an <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/chinas-rare-earth-export-restrictions-threaten-global-chipmaking-supply-chains\">extension of those announced in April</a>, foreign companies will need China’s permission to export magnets that contain trace amounts of rare-earth materials sourced from China, or were produced using the country’s extraction methods. As the dominant supplier of rare earth minerals globally, China exerting more pressure on supply could have knock-on effects.</p><p>Ultimately, this policy decision poses a direct risk to the building blocks of hardware, starting with storage. High-density HDDs use neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets to drive the actuator arms that read data off spinning platters. A typical voice-coil motor depends on neodymium mixed with dysprosium or praseodymium to maintain coercivity at high temperatures. With China controlling the bulk of global processing capacity for those alloys, any licensing restrictions are likely to hit costs and delivery timelines first, and that’s before you get to the motors in fans and cooling systems.</p><p>Displays could also be hit. LED backlights and LCD panels rely on phosphor compounds doped with europium, terbium, and yttrium to produce vivid colors. Europium and terbium are both squarely in the new controls, with export licenses now required for dozens of items used in the production chain. That puts panel manufacturers, which are already under margin pressure, in the firing line again.</p><p>Even silicon isn’t safe. Cerium oxide slurries, used in wafer polishing and glass finishing, may also come under pressure if restrictions expand to cover recycling or processing gear. These aren’t headlining materials, but they play a crucial role in production flows across fabs and panel assembly lines. If licenses start dragging or pricing shifts, delays in component manufacturing are almost inevitable. Indeed, the supply of rare earth minerals is just one of the factors <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/storage/perfect-storm-of-demand-and-supply-driving-up-storage-costs\">fuelling growing concern around looming PC hardware shortages</a>.</p><p>None of this will guarantee price hikes tomorrow, but it raises the odds of sudden friction in parts of the supply chain that often go unnoticed. Magnets and phosphors aren’t exciting or sexy, but they’re everywhere and extremely difficult to replace. In April, HDD maker Western Digital launched a program to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/hdds/wd-launches-hdd-recycling-process-that-reclaims-rare-earth-elements-cuts-out-china\">recover rare-earth materials from retired drives</a>, which is an obvious attempt to safeguard against this very scenario.</p><p><em>Follow</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqLAgKIiZDQklTRmdnTWFoSUtFSFJ2YlhOb1lYSmtkMkZ5WlM1amIyMG9BQVAB\"><em> Tom's Hardware on Google News</em></a><em>, or</em><a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://google.com/preferences/source?q=\"><em> add us as a preferred source</em></a><em>, to get our up-to-date news, analysis, and reviews in your feeds.

The ultimate plan of the current administration is to boost domestic semiconductor production to more than 40% by the end of President Donald Trump's current term.</p><p>As observed by officials in Taiwan and analysts, the proposal lacks a workable definition, overstates Taiwan's influence on supply constraints, overlooks the current state of the U.S. semiconductor industry, and ignores peculiarities of the global supply chain.</p><h2 id=\"the-proposal-2\">The proposal</h2><p>Lutnick said in an interview that the U.S. government has held preliminary talks with Taipei about rebalancing chip output to ensure that half of America's consumption comes from domestic facilities. Even if successful, he acknowledged, the country would remain reliant on Taiwan but would gain the ability to act independently if a crisis arises. Lutnick links his proposal to Taiwan's security, suggesting that a stronger U.S. production base would enable America to safeguard the island more easily, as it would have the means to do so, and would not be dependent on chip supply from the country.</p><p>He rejects the idea that Taiwan's (or rather TSMC's) advanced logic dominance — the so-called Silicon Shield — inherently deters conflict. To a large degree, his remarks echo Trump's past claims that Taipei benefits from U.S. protection without adequate compensation.</p><p>The Trump administration's stance stems from a long-standing concern: Taiwan manufactures more than 90% of the world's most advanced logic chips, which all happen to be developed in the U.S., which is a vulnerability for American companies like Apple, AMD, Broadcom, Intel, or Nvidia, given the island's proximity to China.</p><p>The current U.S. government believes that if the U.S. shares the manufacturing load, it can better defend Taiwan because critical components would not be trapped offshore. In addition, the U.S. Government also tied the cooperation to continued defense commitments. Furthermore, the administration has also paired this message with economic pressure. It proposed <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/trump-announces-100-percent-semiconductor-tariffs-theres-no-charge-for-chips-built-in-the-u-s\">100% tariffs on imported semiconductors </a>but offered exemptions to companies investing in U.S. fabs, such as TSMC and Samsung, to encourage them to build capacities in the U.S. In all likelihood, the proposed 100% tariff would <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/trumps-100-percent-chip-tariffs-will-likely-hurt-smaller-manufacturers-as-major-companies-court-exemptions\">hurt smaller manufacturers</a>.</p><h2 id=\"american-semiconductor-industry-today-2\">American semiconductor industry today</h2><p>Lutnick's '50% – 50%' idea focuses on geography instead of capacity. The real issue is not that too many chips are made in Taiwan: it is that the U.S. does not have enough advanced-node capacity or packaging infrastructure to meet its own demand, particularly to make chips equipped for techologies like 5G or AI.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:2560px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"RsQrx3Du6DkXezDVZ8fVsb\" name=\"globalfoundries-fab-8-semiconductor-cleanroom-hero.png\" alt=\"GlobalFoundries\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsQrx3Du6DkXezDVZ8fVsb.png\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: GlobalFoundries)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The United States already manufactures a large number of chips domestically — Analog Devices, GlobalFoundries, Texas Instruments, SkyWater, and onsemi produce vast quantities of mature-node semiconductors used in cars, power systems, and industrial gear. These often represent the majority of chips in terms of unit count and revenue.  Meanwhile, Intel produces plenty of advanced logic chips in the USA, whereas <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/samsung-delays-usd44-billion-texas-chip-fab-sources-say-completion-halted-because-there-are-no-customers\">Samsung Foundry</a> and <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-starts-construction-its-1-6nm-and-2nm-capable-u-s-fab-fab-21-phase-3\">TSMC</a> aim to significantly expand their advanced fabs in America.</p><p>So, the U.S. already makes millions of chips, but lags in cutting-edge logic used in AI accelerators, CPUs, smartphones, and servers. Rebalancing the total chip production 50% – 50% is meaningless if the categories are mixed or not defined: the bottleneck lies in EUV-era logic and advanced packaging, not in chips produced on trailing nodes, which represent the lion's share of all chip supply.</p><p>\"The '50% – 50%' lacks a workable definition, hindering substantive discussion,\" <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/0tISwsTUofpi4R\" target=\"_blank\">wrote Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, an analyst with TF International Securities. \"For example, does it refer only to advanced nodes, or also include mature nodes or advanced packaging? Does it apply to chips used domestically within the U.S., or those required by the U.S. government and companies? Without a clear definition, meaningful discussions cannot proceed. This also helps explain why Cheng Li-Chun, Taiwan’s Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, said there have been no '50% – 50%' discussions with the U.S.\"</p><p>Taiwan views its cooperation with the United States as mutually beneficial, rather than delivering on a fixed quota. TSMC's management has expressed commitment to its U.S. sites but remains cautious about overextending resources abroad, highlighting that complex production chains cannot be duplicated overnight.</p><p>For years, the United States has been attempting to reclaim lost ground in leading-edge microelectronics. While Intel continues to produce its latest products on <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-details-18a-process-technology-boosts-performance-by-25-percent-or-lowers-power-consumption-by-36-percent\">its most advanced nodes</a> in America, its arch-rival AMD has long become a fabless semiconductor designer, and Nvidia has always been one. However, GlobalFoundries has ceased to develop leading-edge process technologies. As a result, Taiwan-based TSMC and UMC have gradually absorbed production of advanced chips, which were developed in the U.S., due to costs and logistical reasons. Since the majority of PCs and smartphones are assembled in Asia, it makes sense to make chips there as well.</p><h2 id=\"is-50-50-possible-at-all-2\">Is 50% - 50% possible at all?</h2><p>Lutnick's 50% - 50% proposal looks bold, but it remains aspirational because the gap between American and Taiwanese capabilities is vast. TSMC alone produces more advanced chips than the rest of the world combined.  Catching up would require multiple new fabs, tens of thousands of advanced tools from Europe and the U.S., in addition to tens of thousands of skilled workers that the United States <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/semiconductor-industry-faces-critical-talent-crisis-one-million-additional-skilled-workers-needed-by-2030\">currently lacks</a>.</p><p>Industry leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. labor pipeline for advanced manufacturing remains limited, which makes constructing news fabs longer and running them difficult.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1600px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"nHgDDyR8KZuRfXaU7cJgYb\" name=\"Intel-fab-feature.jpg\" alt=\"Intel D1X Mod3 fab expansion in Oregon\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nHgDDyR8KZuRfXaU7cJgYb.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TSMC's <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmc-to-spend-usd42-billion-on-expansion-in-2025-ambitious-plans-detail-nine-production-facilities\">ongoing expansion in the United States</a> already represents the largest foreign semiconductor investment in history. The plan includes six fabs for advanced nodes, two advanced packaging facilities, and one research center. The first facility in Arizona — Fab 21 phase 1 — started mass production in late 2024, while the second — Fab 21 phase 2 — was initially expected to use the N3 process by 2028, but has been accelerated to the second half of 2027 and upgraded to include N2 (and possibly A16) technology at the request of the U.S. government, according to Kuo.</p><p>The analyst expects the first three fabs to reach full utilization between 2028 and 2030. TSMC itself says that 30% of its N2/16 capacity will be located in the USA, whereas Kuo suggests that its U.S. output will account for roughly 10% to 15% of the foundry's global capacity by 2030, and once all six phases of Fab 21 are operational around 2032, the share could reach 25% to 30%. By some definitions, this level would already fulfil the intent of producing half of America's advanced-node demand domestically at TSMC's Fab 21 in Arizona alone, not to mention Intel's fabs in Arizona and Ohio as well as Samsung's fab in Texas.</p><p>Kuo argues that the real constraint on American self-reliance is not the willingness or unwillingness of chipmakers to invest in U.S. capacities, but the actual semiconductor industry ecosystem that supports chip manufacturing.</p><p>The upstream network supplying materials such as ultra-pure photoresists, underfills, and liquid monomer coatings is heavily concentrated in Japan. Companies like JSR, Namics, and Nagase currently ship to Arizona to support TSMC's Fab 21 phase 1, but as capacity grows, they would need to establish local production or logistics centers in America to avoid tariffs and add flexibility. Building such infrastructure will take years and may not be commercially attractive straight away, given the relatively small demand outside Asia as of today.</p><p>Neither Intel, nor TSMC, nor Samsung has been able to persuade JSR to build a photoresist or CMP factory outside of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, or the U.S., where it serves plenty of customers.</p><p>However, if GlobalFoundries, Intel, Micron, Samsung, and TSMC build the necessary EUV-based capacity in the U.S., JSR may be more inclined to build its own plant on American soil. At the end of the day, the global photoresist market is expected to grow to <a data-analytics-id=\"inline-link\" href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/photoresist-market-184731291.html\" target=\"_blank\">$5.3 billion</a> by 2028, and the U.S. may stand to represent a significant share.</p><p>This dependence on Japanese materials undercuts the assumption that relocating fabs automatically guarantees security. If geopolitical tensions were to disrupt East Asian trade routes, it is unclear whether Japanese firms could continue supplying chemicals to American customers. Thus, moving chip fabrication to the United States without parallel supply-chain localization would just shift vulnerabilities from one region to another.</p><p>The same applies to equipment vendors from Europe and the Netherlands, whose lithography tools remain irreplaceable. Semiconductor resilience depends on the entire global ecosystem:  from raw materials to chipmaking equipment and packaging facilities, not just the geographical placement of wafer fabs.</p><h2 id=\"does-it-make-financial-sense-2\">Does it make financial sense?</h2><p>Perhaps a fundamental question is whether it even makes sense to produce half of chips for the U.S. in America, considering the fact that they are more expensive than chips made in Asia.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"ncBURJMeiru4ME55B6NCEJ\" name=\"micron-fab-cleanroom-wafer-semiconductor-fab-foundry-hero.jpg\" alt=\"Micron\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncBURJMeiru4ME55B6NCEJ.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Micron)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a cost standpoint, producing half of the chips used in the U.S. on domestic soil is inefficient. Even chips made on TSMC's proven N4/N4P/N5/N5P technologies in the U.S. are said to carry a 30% higher markup than the same chips produced in Taiwan, and while companies like AMD, Apple, and Nvidia can absorb that extra cost, not all companies are that rich.</p><p>Furthermore, Asian hubs benefit from dense industrial ecosystems that span from raw materials to fab tool suppliers, enabling fast maintenance and low logistics costs. New U.S. fabs must recreate that web from scratch, and their output will take years to match that of long-established facilities abroad.</p><p>Overall, end-users in America will have to pay more for chips produced in the U.S. The difference might seem small per component, but it scales significantly across industries. Everything that relies on silicon — cars, medical devices, PCs, smartphones — absorbs a fraction of the added cost, and becomes more expensive. The price inflation is something that remains to be seen, but ultimately, Americans will have to pay for the onshoring of semiconductor production.</p><p>Of course, the logic changes when viewed through the lens of security and resilience. The United States consumes roughly 25% - 33% of the world's semiconductor supply. But it manufactures only about 10% - 12%, and its leading-edge capacity is limited. Meanwhile, Taiwan alone accounts for approximately 90% of leading-edge logic output. Any disruption — whether from conflict, blockade, or earthquake — would affect everything from cloud infrastructure of AWS and Microsoft Azure, to defense electronics.</p><p>Truth be told, not many sensitive microelectronics are produced outside the U.S., but the economic harm caused by disruptions may be comparable to actual military harm. Therefore, the proposed '50% to 50%' plan may be considered an insurance policy that guarantees the U.S. and its allies' economic and military continuity, if Asian production faltered.</p><p>As a bonus, each fab attracts satellite suppliers, boosts local innovation, and rebuilds technical skills that generate far greater downstream value. However, though the immediate financial return looks weak, the long-term industrial payoff may be substantial. Making half of America's chips domestically may be inefficient, but strategically important.</p><h2 id=\"political-symbolism-2\">Political symbolism</h2><p>The implications of Lutnick's proposal extend beyond economics, defense, and supply chains. For the Trump administration, the political symbolism of semiconductor self-reliance is a big deal. Expanding domestic chip production aligns with his economic nationalism and industrial revival, and big announcements by Intel, Samsung, and TSMC enable the government to talk about tangible progress toward that goal.</p><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1648px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"xe7gNx4J3YH2AaLE7Uz3ia\" name=\"intel-arizona-construction-1-16x9.jpg.rendition.intel.web.1648.927.jpg\" alt=\"Intel fab in Arizona.\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xe7gNx4J3YH2AaLE7Uz3ia.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1648\" height=\"927\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The proposed total commitment of $165 billion from TSMC, and substantial plans from other chipmakers reinforce that narrative, even if many commitments were made when Joe Biden was in the White House, and full capacity remains years away.</p><p>Meanwhile, trade talks between Washington and Taipei continue, and future tariff structures for companies getting chips in Taiwan and supplying them to the U.S. will depend on those negotiations.</p><p>Achieving a balance in semiconductor supply will depend on tackling bottlenecks that span across regulators, workforce development, and supplier localization. TSMC's U.S. build-out is already advancing faster than expected, and by the early 2030s, American fabs could meet a significant portion of local demand.</p><p>However, transforming the global semiconductor supply chain into a model, equipped with multiple major vertically-integrated semiconductor manufacturing hubs, led by America and Taiwan, would require changes that are outside the U.S. government's control.</p><h2 id=\"what-s-next-2\">What's next?</h2><figure class=\"van-image-figure  inline-layout\" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style=\"max-width:1920px;\"><p class=\"vanilla-image-block\" style=\"padding-top:56.25%;\"><img id=\"b4HsYuG3gahvT8EcqKeJUf\" name=\"ntel-fab-semiconductor-chip-foundry-hero.jpg\" alt=\"Intel\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4HsYuG3gahvT8EcqKeJUf.jpg\" mos=\"\" align=\"middle\" fullscreen=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" attribution=\"\" endorsement=\"\" class=\"\"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop=\"caption description\" class=\" inline-layout\"><span class=\"credit\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">(Image credit: Intel)</span></figcaption></figure><p>True strategic autonomy for the U.S. will require more than just advanced logic fabs.

Developers can now generate well-structured code from plain language prompts, saving hours of manual effort. These tools learn from vast codebases, offering context-aware recommendations that enhance productivity and reduce errors. Rather than starting from scratch, engineers can prototype quickly, iterate faster and focus on solving increasingly complex problems.</p><p>As code generation tools grow in popularity, they raise questions about the future size and structure of engineering teams. Earlier this year, Garry Tan, CEO of startup accelerator Y Combinator, noted that about one-quarter of its current clients use AI to write 95% or more of their software.<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/15/y-combinator-startups-are-fastest-growing-in-fund-history-because-of-ai.html\"> <u>In an interview with CNBC</u></a>, Tan said: “What that means for founders is that you don’t need a team of 50 or 100 engineers, you don’t have to raise as much. The capital goes much longer.”</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/ai-coding-software-engineers.html\"><u>AI-powered coding</u></a> may offer a fast solution for businesses under budget pressure — but its long-term effects on the field and labor pool cannot be ignored.</p><h2>As AI-powered coding rises, human expertise may diminish</h2><p><b>\n</b>In the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/why-99-of-companies-fail-at-ai-integration-and-how-to-join-the-1-that\">era of AI</a>, the traditional journey to coding expertise that has long supported senior developers may be at risk. Easy access to large language models (LLMs) enables junior coders to quickly identify issues in code. While this speeds up software development, it can distance developers from their own work, delaying the growth of core problem-solving skills. As a result, they may avoid the focused, sometimes uncomfortable hours required to build expertise and progress on the path to becoming successful senior developers.</p><p>Consider <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-can-now-process-entire-software-projects-in-single-request-anthropic-says\">Anthropic’s Claude Code</a>, a terminal-based assistant built on the Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, which automates bug detection and resolution, test creation and code refactoring. Using natural language commands, it reduces repetitive manual work and boosts productivity.</p><p>Microsoft has also released two open-source frameworks — <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-retires-autogen-and-debuts-agent-framework-to-unify-and-govern\">AutoGen and Semantic Kernel</a> — to support the development of agentic AI systems. AutoGen enables asynchronous messaging, modular components, and distributed agent collaboration to build complex workflows with minimal human input. Semantic Kernel is an SDK that integrates LLMs with languages like C#, Python and Java, letting developers build AI agents to automate tasks and manage enterprise applications.</p><p>The increasing availability of these tools from Anthropic, Microsoft and others may reduce opportunities for coders to refine and deepen their skills. Rather than “banging their heads against the wall” to debug a few lines or select a library to unlock new features, junior developers may simply turn to AI for an assist. This means senior coders with problem-solving skills honed over decades may become an endangered species.</p><p>Overreliance on AI for writing code risks weakening developers’ hands-on experience and understanding of key programming concepts. Without regular practice, they may struggle to independently debug, optimize or design systems. Ultimately, this erosion of skill can undermine critical thinking, creativity and adaptability — qualities that are essential not just for coding, but for assessing the quality and logic of AI-generated solutions.</p><h2>AI as mentor: Turning code automation into hands-on learning</h2><p>While concerns about AI diminishing human developer skills are valid, businesses shouldn’t dismiss AI-supported coding. They just need to think carefully about when and how to deploy AI tools in development. These tools can be more than productivity boosters; they can act as interactive mentors, guiding coders in real time with explanations, alternatives and best practices.</p><p>When u<!-- -->sed as a training tool, AI can reinforce learning by showing coders why code is broken and how to fix it—rather than simply applying a solution. For example, a junior developer using Claude Code might receive immediate feedback on inefficient syntax or logic errors, along with suggestions linked to detailed explanations. This enables active learning, not passive correction. It’s a win-win: Accelerating project timelines without doing all the work for junior coders.</p><p>Additionally, coding frameworks can support experimentation by letting developers prototype agent workflows or integrate LLMs without needing expert-level knowledge upfront. By observing how AI builds and refines code, junior developers who actively engage with these tools can internalize patterns, architectural decisions and debugging strategies — mirroring the traditional learning process of trial and error, code reviews and mentorship.</p><p>However, AI coding assistants shouldn’t replace real mentorship or pair programming. Pull requests and formal code reviews remain essential for guiding newer, less experienced team members. We are nowhere near the point at which AI can single-handedly upskill a junior developer.</p><p>Companies and educators can build structured development programs around these tools that emphasize code comprehension to ensure AI is used as a training partner rather than a crutch. This encourages coders to question AI outputs and requires manual refactoring exercises. In this way, AI becomes less of a replacement for human ingenuity and more of a catalyst for accelerated, experiential learning.</p><h2>Bridging the gap between automation and education</h2><p>When utilized with intention, AI doesn’t just write code; it teaches coding, blending automation with education to prepare developers for a future where deep understanding and adaptability remain indispensable.</p><p>By embracing AI as a mentor, as a programming partner and as a team of developers we can direct to the problem at hand, we can bridge the gap between effective automation and education. We can empower developers to grow alongside the tools they use. We can ensure that, as AI evolves, so too does the human skill set, fostering a generation of coders who are both efficient and deeply knowledgeable.</p><p><i>Richard Sonnenblick is chief data scientist at </i><a href=\"https://www.planview.com/\"><i>Planview</i></a><i>. </i></p>]]></description>\n            <author>planview@matternow.com (Richard Sonnenblick, Planview)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>DataDecisionMakers</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/6O2FgBkLOdYG0bQrbbceee/70c01c9a6f6498e1888781c6ec759dd8/Junior_coders.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[When dirt meets data: ScottsMiracle-Gro saved $150M using AI]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/when-dirt-meets-data-scottsmiracle-gro</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">3gseMvS6Xrp7pjDmyrX6ng</guid>\n            <pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>How a semiconductor veteran turned over a century of horticultural wisdom into AI-led competitive advantage </b></p><p>For decades, a ritual played out across ScottsMiracle-Gro’s media facilities. Every few weeks, workers walked acres of towering compost and wood chip piles with nothing more than measuring sticks. They wrapped rulers around each mound, estimated height, and did what company President Nate Baxter now describes as “sixth-grade geometry to figure out volume.”</p><p>Today, drones glide over those same plants with mechanical precision. Vision systems calculate volumes in real time. The move from measuring sticks to artificial intelligence signals more than efficiency. It is the visible proof of one of corporate America’s most unlikely technology stories.</p><h2><b>The AI revolution finds an unexpected leader</b></h2><p>Enterprise AI has been led by predictable players.

Consumer packaged goods companies that handle physical products like fertilizer and soil were not expected to lead.</p><p>Yet ScottsMiracle-Gro has realized more than half of a targeted $150 million in supply chain savings. It reports a 90 percent improvement in customer service response times. Its predictive models enable weekly reallocation of marketing resources across regional markets.</p><p><b>A Silicon Valley veteran bets on soil science</b></p><p>Baxter’s path to ScottsMiracle-Gro (SMG) reads like a calculated pivot, not a corporate rescue. After two decades in semiconductor manufacturing at Intel and Tokyo Electron, he knew how to apply advanced technology to complex operations.</p><p>“I sort of initially said, ‘Why would I do this? I’m running a tech company. It’s an industry I’ve been in for 25 years,’” Baxter recalls of his reaction when ScottsMiracle-Gro CEO Jim Hagedorn approached him in 2023. The company was reeling from a collapsed $1.2 billion hydroponics investment and facing what he describes as “pressure from a leverage standpoint.”</p><p>His wife challenged him with a direct prompt. If you are not learning or putting yourself in uncomfortable situations, you should change that.</p><p>Baxter saw clear parallels between semiconductor manufacturing and SMG’s operations. Both require precision, quality control, and the optimization of complex systems. He also saw untapped potential in SMG’s domain knowledge. One hundred fifty years of horticultural expertise, regulatory know-how, and customer insight had never been fully digitized.</p><p>“It became apparent to me whether it was on the backend with data analytics, business process transformation, and obviously now with AI being front and center of the consumer experience, a lot of opportunities are there,” he explains.</p><h2><b>The declaration that changed everything</b></h2><p>The pivot began at an all-hands meeting. “I just said, you know, guys, we’re a tech company. You just don’t know it yet,” Baxter recalls. “There’s so much opportunity here to drive this company to where it needs to go.”</p><p>The first challenge was organizational. SMG had evolved into functional silos. IT, supply chain, and brand teams ran independent systems with little coordination. Drawing on his experience with complex technology organizations, Baxter restructured the consumer business into three business units. General managers became accountable not just for financial results but also for technology implementation within their domains.</p><p>“I came in and said, we’re going to create new business units,” he explains. “The buck stops with you and I’m holding you accountable not only for the business results, for the quality of the creative and marketing, but for the implementation of technology.”</p><p>To support the new structure, SMG set up centers of excellence for digital capabilities, insights and analytics, and creative functions. The hybrid design placed centralized expertise behind distributed accountability.</p><h2><b>Mining corporate memory for AI gold</b></h2><p>Turning legacy knowledge into machine-ready intelligence required what Fausto Fleites, VP of Data Intelligence, calls “archaeological work.” The team excavated decades of business logic embedded in legacy SAP systems and converted filing cabinets of research into AI-ready datasets. Fleites, a Cuban immigrant with a doctorate from FIU who led Florida’s public hurricane loss model before roles at Sears and Cemex, understood the stakes.</p><p>“The costly part of the migration was the business reporting layer we have in SAP Business Warehouse,” Fleites explains. “You need to uncover business logic created in many cases over decades.”</p><p>SMG chose Databricks as its unified data platform. The team had Apache Spark expertise. Databricks offered strong SAP integration and aligned with a preference for open-source technologies that minimize vendor lock-in.</p><p>The breakthrough came through systematic knowledge management. SMG built an AI bot using Google’s Gemini large language model to catalog and clean internal repositories. The system identified duplicates, grouped content by topic, and restructured information for AI consumption. The effort reduced knowledge articles by 30 percent while increasing their utility.</p><p>“We used Gemini LLMs to actually categorize them into topics, find similar documents,” Fleites explains. A hybrid approach that combined modern AI with techniques like cosine similarity became the foundation for later applications.</p><h2><b>Building AI systems that actually understand fertilizer</b></h2><p>Early trials with off-the-shelf AI exposed a real risk. General-purpose models confused products designed for killing weeds with those for preventing them. That mistake can ruin a lawn.</p><p>“Different products, if you use one in the wrong place, would actually have a very negative outcome,” Fleites notes. “But those are kind of synonyms in certain contexts to the LLM. So they were recommending the wrong products.”</p><p>The solution was a new architecture. SMG created what Fleites calls a “hierarchy of agents.” A supervisor agent routes queries to specialized worker agents organized by brand. Each agent draws on deep product knowledge encoded from a 400-page internal training manual.</p><p>The system also changes the conversation. When users ask for recommendations, the agents start with questions about location, goals, and lawn conditions. They narrow possibilities step by step before offering suggestions. The stack integrates with APIs for product availability and state-specific regulatory compliance.</p><p><b>From drones to demand forecasting across the enterprise</b></p><p>The transformation runs across the company. Drones measure inventory piles. Demand forecasting models analyze more than 60 factors, including weather patterns, consumer sentiment, and macroeconomic indicators.</p><p>These predictions enable faster moves. When drought struck Texas, the models supported a shift in promotional spending to regions with favorable weather. The reallocation helped drive positive quarterly results.</p><p>“We not only have the ability to move marketing and promotion dollars around, but we’ve even gotten to the point where if it’s going to be a big weekend in the Northeast, we’ll shift our field sales resources from other regions up there,” Baxter explains.</p><p>Consumer Services changed as well. AI agents now process incoming emails through Salesforce, draft responses based on the knowledge base, and flag them for brief human review. Draft times dropped from ten minutes to seconds and response quality improved.</p><p>The company emphasizes explainable AI. Using SHAP, SMG built dashboards that decompose each forecast and show how weather, promotions, or media spending contribute to predictions.</p><p>“Typically, if you open a prediction to a business person and you don’t say why, they’ll say, ‘I don’t believe you,’” Fleites explains. Transparency made it possible to move resource allocation from quarterly to weekly cycles.</p><h2><b>Competing like a startup</b></h2><p>SMG’s results challenge assumptions about AI readiness in traditional industries. The advantage does not come from owning the most sophisticated models. It comes from combining general-purpose AI with unique, structured domain knowledge.</p><p>“LLMs are going to be a commodity,” Fleites observes. “The strategic differentiator is what is the additional level of [internal] knowledge we can fit to them.”</p><p>Partnerships are central. SMG works with Google Vertex AI for foundational models, Sierra.ai for production-ready conversational agents, and Kindwise for computer vision. The ecosystem approach lets a small internal team recruited from Meta, Google, and AI startups deliver outsized impact without building everything from scratch.</p><p>Talent follows impact. Conventional wisdom says traditional companies cannot compete with Meta salaries or Google stock. SMG offered something different. It offered the chance to build transformative AI applications with immediate business impact.</p><p>“When we have these interviews, what we propose to them is basically the ability to have real value with the latest knowledge in these spaces,” Fleites explains. “A lot of people feel motivated to come to us” because much of big tech AI work, despite the hype, “doesn’t really have an impact.”</p><p>Team design mirrors that philosophy. “My direct reports are leaders and not only manage people, but are technically savvy,” Fleites notes. “We always are constantly switching hands between developing or maintaining a solution versus strategy versus managing people.” He still writes code weekly. The small team of 15 to 20 AI and engineering professionals stays lean by contracting out implementation while keeping “the know-how and the direction and the architecture” in-house.</p><h2><b>When innovation meets immovable objects</b></h2><p>Not every pilot succeeded. SMG tested semi-autonomous forklifts in a 1.3 million square foot distribution facility. Remote drivers in the Philippines controlled up to five vehicles at once with strong safety records.</p><p>“The technology was actually really great,” Baxter acknowledges. The vehicles could not lift enough weight for SMG’s heavy products. The company paused implementation.</p><p>“Not everything we’ve tried has gone smoothly,” Baxter admits. “But I think another important point is you have to focus on a few critical ones and you have to know when something isn’t going to work and readjust.”</p><p>The lesson tracks with semiconductor discipline. Investments must show measurable returns within set timeframes. Regulatory complexity adds difficulty. Products must comply with EPA rules and a patchwork of state restrictions, which AI systems must navigate correctly.</p><h2><b>The gardening sommelier and agent-to-agent futures</b></h2><p>The roadmap reflects a long-term view. SMG plans a “gardening sommelier” mobile app in 2026 that identifies plants, weeds, and lawn problems from photos and provides instant guidance. A beta already helps field sales teams answer complex product questions by querying the 400-page knowledge base.</p><p>The company is exploring agent-to-agent communication so its specialized AI can interface with retail partners’ systems. A customer who asks a Walmart chatbot for lawn advice could trigger an SMG query that returns accurate, regulation-compliant recommendations.</p><p>SMG has launched AI-powered search on its website, replacing keyword systems with conversational engines based on the internal stack. The future vision pairs predictive models with conversational agents so the system can reach out when conditions suggest a customer may need help.</p><h2><b>What traditional industries can learn</b></h2><p>ScottsMiracle-Gro&#x27;s transformation offers a clear playbook for enterprises. The advantage doesn&#x27;t come from deploying the most sophisticated models. Instead, it comes from combining AI with proprietary domain knowledge that competitors can&#x27;t easily replicate.</p><p>By making general managers responsible for both business results and technology implementation, SMG ensured AI wasn&#x27;t just an IT initiative but a business imperative. The 150 years of horticultural expertise only became valuable when it was digitized, structured, and made accessible to AI systems.</p><p>Legacy companies competing for AI engineers can&#x27;t match Silicon Valley compensation packages. But they can offer something tech giants often can&#x27;t: immediate, measurable impact. When engineers see their weather forecasting models directly influence quarterly results or their agent architecture prevent customers from ruining their lawns, the work carries weight that another incremental improvement to an ad algorithm never will.</p><p>“We have a right to win,” Baxter says. “We have 150 years of this experience.” That experience is now data, and data is the company’s competitive edge. ScottsMiracle-Gro didn’t outspend its rivals or chase the newest AI model. It turned knowledge into an operating system for growth. For a company built on soil, its biggest breakthrough might be cultivating data.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>james@thomason.io (James Thomason)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/7d0hJ4qtWTk5GaypvPfHJY/53aa8c26a39b5f10e16b3073dd73a388/videoframe_878.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Together AI's ATLAS adaptive speculator delivers 400% inference speedup by learning from workloads in real-time]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/together-ais-atlas-adaptive-speculator-delivers-400-inference-speedup-by</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6mM7lVKT3gElikm19oiLGu</guid>\n            <pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Enterprises expanding AI deployments are hitting an invisible performance wall. The culprit? Static speculators that can&#x27;t keep up with shifting workloads.</p><p>Speculators are smaller AI models that work alongside large language models during inference. They draft multiple tokens ahead, which the main model then verifies in parallel. This technique (called speculative decoding) has become essential for enterprises trying to reduce inference costs and latency. Instead of generating tokens one at a time, the system can accept multiple tokens at once, dramatically improving throughput.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.together.ai/\"><u>Together AI</u></a> today announced research and a new system called ATLAS (AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System) that aims to help enterprises overcome the challenge of static speculators. The technique provides a self-learning inference optimization capability that can help to deliver up to 400% faster inference performance than a baseline level of performance available in existing inference technologies such as vLLM.. The system addresses a critical problem: as AI workloads evolve, inference speeds degrade, even with specialized speculators in place.</p><p>The company which<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-startup-together-raises-funding-for-open-source-ai-and-cloud-platform\"> <u>got its start</u></a> in 2023, has been focused on<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/together-ai-promises-faster-inference-and-lower-costs-with-enterprise-ai-platform-for-private-cloud\"> <u>optimizing inference</u></a> on its enterprise AI platform. Earlier this year the company<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/together-ais-305m-bet-reasoning-models-like-deepseek-r1-are-increasing-not-decreasing-gpu-demand\"> <u>raised $305 million</u></a> as customer adoption and demand has grown.</p><p>&quot;Companies we work with generally, as they scale up, they see shifting workloads, and then they don&#x27;t see as much speedup from speculative execution as before,&quot; Tri Dao, chief scientist at Together AI, told VentureBeat in an exclusive interview. &quot;These speculators generally don&#x27;t work well when their workload domain starts to shift.&quot;</p><h2>The workload drift problem no one talks about</h2><p>Most speculators in production today are &quot;static&quot; models. They&#x27;re trained once on a fixed dataset representing expected workloads, then deployed without any ability to adapt. Companies like Meta and Mistral ship pre-trained speculators alongside their main models. Inference platforms like vLLM use these static speculators to boost throughput without changing output quality.</p><p>But there&#x27;s a catch. When an enterprise&#x27;s AI usage evolves the static speculator&#x27;s accuracy plummets.</p><p>&quot;If you&#x27;re a company producing coding agents, and most of your developers have been writing in Python, all of a sudden some of them switch to writing Rust or C, then you see the speed starts to go down,&quot; Dao explained. &quot;The speculator has a mismatch between what it was trained on versus what the actual workload is.&quot;</p><p>This workload drift represents a hidden tax on scaling AI. Enterprises either accept degraded performance or invest in retraining custom speculators. That process captures only a snapshot in time and quickly becomes outdated.</p><h2>How adaptive speculators work: A dual-model approach</h2><p>ATLAS uses a dual-speculator architecture that combines stability with adaptation:</p><p><b>The static speculator</b> - A heavyweight model trained on broad data provides consistent baseline performance. It serves as a &quot;speed floor.&quot;</p><p><b>The adaptive speculator</b> - A lightweight model learns continuously from live traffic. It specializes on-the-fly to emerging domains and usage patterns.</p><p><b>The confidence-aware controller</b> - An orchestration layer dynamically chooses which speculator to use. It adjusts the speculation &quot;lookahead&quot; based on confidence scores.</p><p>&quot;Before the adaptive speculator learns anything, we still have the static speculator to help provide the speed boost in the beginning,&quot; Ben Athiwaratkun, staff AI scientist at Together AI explained to VentureBeat. &quot;Once the adaptive speculator becomes more confident, then the speed grows over time.&quot;</p><p>The technical innovation lies in balancing acceptance rate (how often the target model agrees with drafted tokens) and draft latency. As the adaptive model learns from traffic patterns, the controller relies more on the lightweight speculator and extends lookahead. This compounds performance gains.</p><p>Users don&#x27;t need to tune any parameters. &quot;On the user side, users don&#x27;t have to turn any knobs,&quot; Dao said. &quot;On our side, we have turned these knobs for users to adjust in a configuration that gets good speedup.&quot;</p><h2>Performance that rivals custom silicon</h2><p>Together AI&#x27;s testing shows ATLAS reaching 500 tokens per second on DeepSeek-V3.1 when fully adapted. More impressively, those numbers on Nvidia B200 GPUs match or exceed specialized inference chips like<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/groq-just-made-hugging-face-way-faster-and-its-coming-for-aws-and-google\"> <u>Groq&#x27;s</u></a> custom hardware.</p><p>&quot;The software and algorithmic improvement is able to close the gap with really specialized hardware,&quot; Dao said. &quot;We were seeing 500 tokens per second on these huge models that are even faster than some of the customized chips.&quot;</p><p>The 400% speedup that the company claims for inference represents the cumulative effect of Together&#x27;s Turbo optimization suite. FP4 quantization delivers 80% speedup over FP8 baseline. The static Turbo Speculator adds another 80-100% gain. The adaptive system layers on top. Each optimization compounds the benefits of the others.</p><p>Compared to standard inference engines like<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-snowflakes-open-source-text-to-sql-and-arctic-inference-models-solve-enterprise-ais-two-biggest-deployment-headaches\"> <u>vLLM</u></a> or Nvidia&#x27;s TensorRT-LLM, the improvement is substantial. Together AI benchmarks against the stronger baseline between the two for each workload before applying speculative optimizations.</p><h2>The memory-compute tradeoff explained</h2><p>The performance gains stem from exploiting a fundamental inefficiency in modern inference: wasted compute capacity.</p><p>Dao explained that typically during inference, much of the compute power is not fully utilized.</p><p>&quot;During inference, which is actually the dominant workload nowadays, you&#x27;re mostly using the memory subsystem,&quot; he said.</p><p>Speculative decoding trades idle compute for reduced memory access. When a model generates one token at a time, it&#x27;s memory-bound. The GPU sits idle while waiting for memory. But when the speculator proposes five tokens and the target model verifies them simultaneously, compute utilization spikes while memory access remains roughly constant.</p><p>&quot;The total amount of compute to generate five tokens is the same, but you only had to access memory once, instead of five times,&quot; Dao said.</p><h2>Think of it as intelligent caching for AI</h2><p>For infrastructure teams familiar with traditional database optimization, adaptive speculators function like an intelligent caching layer, but with a crucial difference.</p><p>Traditional caching systems like Redis or memcached require exact matches. You store the exact same query result and retrieve it when that specific query runs again. Adaptive speculators work differently.</p><p>&quot;You can view it as an intelligent way of caching, not storing exactly, but figuring out some patterns that you see,&quot; Dao explained. &quot;Broadly, we&#x27;re observing that you&#x27;re working with similar code, or working with similar, you know, controlling compute in a similar way. We can then predict what the big model is going to say. We just get better and better at predicting that.&quot;</p><p>Rather than storing exact responses, the system learns patterns in how the model generates tokens. It recognizes that if you&#x27;re editing Python files in a specific codebase, certain token sequences become more likely. The speculator adapts to those patterns, improving its predictions over time without requiring identical inputs.</p><h2>Use cases: RL training and evolving workloads</h2><p>Two enterprise scenarios particularly benefit from adaptive speculators:</p><p><b>Reinforcement learning training</b>: Static speculators quickly fall out of alignment as the policy evolves during training. ATLAS adapts continuously to the shifting policy distribution.</p><p><b>Evolving workloads</b>: As enterprises discover new AI use cases, workload composition shifts. &quot;Maybe they started using AI for chatbots, but then they realized, hey, it can write code, so they start shifting to code,&quot; Dao said. &quot;Or they realize these AIs can actually call tools and control computers and do accounting and things like that.&quot;</p><p>In a vibe-coding session, the adaptive system can specialize for the specific codebase being edited. These are files not seen during training. This further increases acceptance rates and decoding speed.</p><h2>What it means for enterprises and the inference ecosystem</h2><p>ATLAS is available now on Together AI&#x27;s dedicated endpoints as part of the platform at no additional cost. The company&#x27;s 800,000-plus developers (up from 450,000 in February) have access to the optimization.</p><p>But the broader implications extend beyond one vendor&#x27;s product. The shift from static to adaptive optimization represents a fundamental rethinking of how inference platforms should work. As enterprises deploy AI across multiple domains, the industry will need to move beyond one-time trained models toward systems that learn and improve continuously.</p><p>Together AI has historically released some of its research techniques as open source and collaborated with projects like vLLM. While the fully integrated ATLAS system is proprietary, some of the underlying techniques may eventually influence the broader inference ecosystem. </p><p>For enterprises looking to lead in AI, the message is clear: adaptive algorithms on commodity hardware can match custom silicon at a fraction of the cost. As this approach matures across the industry, software optimization increasingly trumps specialized hardware.</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/QKYmkzNToGEJHgfWYSkzb/8dca1ce8a9cecbd949cb5dabb0e4a54b/ATLAS-ai-inference-smk.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpg\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Will updating your AI agents help or hamper their performance?

Enterprises are hard pressed to keep up with the massive pace of change, let alone understand how to adapt to it — which of these new models should they adopt, if any, to power their workflows and the custom AI agents they&#x27;re building to carry them out? </p><p>Help has arrived: <b>AI applications observability startup </b><a href=\"https://www.raindrop.ai/\"><b>Raindrop</b></a><b> has launched Experiments</b>, a new analytics feature that the company describes as the first A/B testing suite designed specifically for enterprise AI agents — allowing companies to see and compare how updating agents to new underlying models, or changing their instructions and tool access, will impact their performance with real end users. </p><p>The release extends Raindrop’s existing observability tools, giving developers and teams a way to see how their agents behave and evolve in real-world conditions.</p><p>With Experiments, teams can track how changes — such as a new tool, prompt, model update, or full pipeline refactor — affect AI performance across millions of user interactions. The new feature is available now for users on Raindrop’s Pro subscription plan ($350 monthly) at <a href=\"https://www.raindrop.ai\">raindrop.ai</a>. </p><div></div><h3><b>A Data-Driven Lens on Agent Development</b></h3><p>Raindrop co-founder and chief technology officer <b>Ben Hylak</b> noted in a product announcement video (above) that Experiments helps teams see “how literally anything changed,” including tool usage, user intents, and issue rates, and to explore differences by demographic factors such as language. The goal is to make model iteration more transparent and measurable.</p><p>The Experiments interface presents results visually, showing when an experiment performs better or worse than its baseline. Increases in negative signals might indicate higher task failure or partial code output, while improvements in positive signals could reflect more complete responses or better user experiences.</p><p>By making this data easy to interpret, Raindrop encourages AI teams to approach agent iteration with the same rigor as modern software deployment—tracking outcomes, sharing insights, and addressing regressions before they compound.</p><h3><b>Background: From AI Observability to Experimentation</b></h3><p>Raindrop’s launch of Experiments builds on the company’s foundation as one of the first <b>AI-native observability platforms</b>, designed to help enterprises monitor and understand how their generative AI systems behave in production. </p><p>As <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/is-your-ai-app-pissing-off-users-or-going-off-script-raindrop-emerges-with-ai-native-observability-platform-to-monitor-performance\">VentureBeat reported earlier this year</a>, the company — originally known as Dawn AI — emerged to address what Hylak<b>, </b>a former Apple human interface designer, called the “black box problem” of AI performance, helping teams catch failures “as they happen and explain to enterprises what went wrong and why.&quot; </p><p>At the time, Hylak described how “AI products fail constantly—in ways both hilarious and terrifying,” noting that unlike traditional software, which throws clear exceptions, “AI products fail silently.” Raindrop’s original platform focused on detecting those silent failures by analyzing signals such as user feedback, task failures, refusals, and other conversational anomalies across millions of daily events.</p><p>The company’s co-founders—  Hylak, <b>Alexis Gauba</b>, and <b>Zubin Singh Koticha </b>— built Raindrop after encountering firsthand the difficulty of debugging AI systems in production. </p><p>“We started by building AI products, not infrastructure,” Hylak told <i>VentureBeat</i>. “But pretty quickly, we saw that to grow anything serious, we needed tooling to understand AI behavior—and that tooling didn’t exist.”</p><p>With Experiments, Raindrop extends that same mission from <b>detecting failures</b> to <b>measuring improvements</b>. The new tool transforms observability data into actionable comparisons, letting enterprises test whether changes to their models, prompts, or pipelines actually make their AI agents better—or just different.</p><h3><b>Solving the “Evals Pass, Agents Fail” Problem</b></h3><p>Traditional evaluation frameworks, while useful for benchmarking, rarely capture the unpredictable behavior of AI agents operating in dynamic environments. </p><p>As Raindrop co-founder <b>Alexis Gauba</b> explained in her <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alexisgauba_were-excited-to-announce-raindrop-experiments-ugcPost-7382156367463100417-s2kF/\">LinkedIn announcement</a>, “Traditional evals don’t really answer this question. They’re great unit tests, but you can’t predict your user’s actions and your agent is running for hours, calling hundreds of tools.”</p><p><b>Gauba said the company consistently heard a common frustration from teams: “Evals pass, agents fail.”</b></p><p>Experiments is meant to close that gap by showing <i>what actually changes</i> when developers ship updates to their systems. </p><p>The tool enables side-by-side comparisons of models, tools, intents, or properties, surfacing measurable differences in behavior and performance.</p><h3><b>Designed for Real-World AI Behavior</b></h3><p>In the announcement video, Raindrop described Experiments as a way to “compare anything and measure how your agent’s behavior actually changed in production across millions of real interactions.”</p><p>The platform helps users spot issues such as task failure spikes, forgetting, or new tools that trigger unexpected errors. </p><p>It can also be used in reverse — starting from a known problem, such as an “agent stuck in a loop,” and tracing back to which model, tool, or flag is driving it. </p><p>From there, developers can dive into detailed traces to find the root cause and ship a fix quickly.</p><p>Each experiment provides a visual breakdown of metrics like tool usage frequency, error rates, conversation duration, and response length. </p><p>Users can click on any comparison to access the underlying event data, giving them a clear view of how agent behavior changed over time. Shared links make it easy to collaborate with teammates or report findings.</p><h3><b>Integration, Scalability, and Accuracy</b></h3><p>According to Hylak, Experiments integrates directly with “the feature flag platforms companies know and love (like Statsig!)” and is designed to work seamlessly with existing telemetry and analytics pipelines. </p><p>For companies without those integrations, it can still compare performance over time—such as yesterday versus today—without additional setup.</p><p>Hylak said teams typically need around 2,000 users per day to produce statistically meaningful results. </p><p>To ensure the accuracy of comparisons, Experiments monitors for sample size adequacy and alerts users if a test lacks enough data to draw valid conclusions.</p><p>“We obsess over making sure metrics like Task Failure and User Frustration are metrics that you’d wake up an on-call engineer for,” Hylak explained. He added that teams can drill into the specific conversations or events that drive those metrics, ensuring transparency behind every aggregate number.</p><h3><b>Security and Data Protection</b></h3><p>Raindrop operates as a cloud-hosted platform but also offers on-premise personally identifiable information (PII) redaction for enterprises that need additional control. </p><p>Hylak said the company is SOC 2 compliant and has launched a <b>PII Guard</b> feature that uses AI to automatically remove sensitive information from stored data. “We take protecting customer data very seriously,” he emphasized.</p><h3><b>Pricing and Plans</b></h3><p>Experiments is part of Raindrop’s <b>Pro plan</b>, which costs $350 per month or $0.0007 per interaction. The Pro tier also includes deep research tools, topic clustering, custom issue tracking, and semantic search capabilities.</p><p>Raindrop’s <b>Starter plan </b>— $65 per month or $0.001 per interaction — offers core analytics including issue detection, user feedback signals, Slack alerts, and user tracking.

In this phase, they learn grammar, facts, and basic associations.</p><p>In the later post-training phase, models usually learn complex reasoning abilities such as <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-technique-helps-llms-rein-in-cot-lengths-optimizing-reasoning-without-exploding-compute-costs\"><u>chain-of-thought</u></a> (CoT) where a model lays out its reasoning step-by-step. This stage often involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-reinforcement-learning-with-human-feedback-is-unlocking-the-power-of-generative-ai\"><u>reinforcement learning from human feedback</u></a> (RLHF), which require specialized, curated datasets.</p><p>The paper’s authors argue this sequential process does not match human comprehension, which is “not a linear token-by-token process, but rather a parallel integration of input with prior knowledge.” Existing pre-training methods lack this mechanism, hindering a model&#x27;s ability to develop deep reasoning from the start.</p><h3><b>How reinforcement learning pre-training works</b></h3><p>RLP reframes this process by treating CoT generation as an action the model takes before predicting the next token. At each step, the model first generates an internal &quot;thought&quot; or reasoning chain. It then predicts the next word in the text, using the original context augmented with its new thought.</p><p>The model receives a reward based on how much its thought improved the accuracy of its prediction compared to a baseline that didn&#x27;t generate a thought (pure next-token prediction). This reward signal is calculated automatically based on the change in probability, eliminating the need for external verifiers or human-labeled data. </p><p>The reward is positive only when the generated thought helps the model better predict the next token. By rewarding thoughts based on their predictive benefit, RLP effectively teaches the model how to think usefully on the same massive, unstructured datasets used for standard pre-training. </p><p>This continuous feedback loop allows the model to learn when a simple predictive guess is sufficient and when it needs to engage in deeper reasoning. As the researchers put it, “RLP is designed to shape thinking in base models by <b>rewarding only those thoughts that measurably help next-token prediction.”</b></p><p>This foundational approach, however, doesn&#x27;t make later fine-tuning stages obsolete. According to Bryan Catanzaro, VP of applied deep learning research at Nvidia and a co-author of the paper, RLP is designed to complement, not replace, these crucial steps. &quot;RLP isn’t meant to replace the later post-training stages like supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback,&quot; Catanzaro told VentureBeat. &quot;Those stages remain crucial for refining model behavior... It’s really designed to amplify the effectiveness of those later phases by giving the model a head start.&quot;</p><h3><b>RLP in action</b></h3><p>In experiments with <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/alibaba-launches-open-source-qwen3-model-that-surpasses-openai-o1-and-deepseek-r1\"><u>Qwen3-1.7B</u></a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/nvidia-releases-a-new-small-open-model-nemotron-nano-9b-v2-with-toggle-on-off-reasoning\"><u>Nemotron-Nano-12B</u></a>, Nvidia’s team tested RLP across a suite of math and science reasoning benchmarks. The results show that<b> models enhanced with RLP consistently outperformed their conventionally trained counterparts, with particularly strong gains in reasoning-heavy tasks. </b></p><p>For an enterprise, this improved reasoning could translate to more reliable outputs in multi-step workflows like financial analysis or legal document summarization.</p><p>&quot;RLP encourages the model during pretraining to think before it predicts, helping the model internalize a more coherent reasoning style,&quot; said Catanzaro. &quot;This could help reduce subtle logical errors, especially in longer workflows.” </p><p>While stressing that RLP-trained models will still need the usual guardrails such as verification layers, human oversight, and consistency checks, Catanzaro said that “RLP gives you a stronger baseline.&quot;</p><p>Importantly, the benefits of RLP compound instead of disappearing during subsequent fine-tuning stages (catastrophic forgetting is a common problem in LLM training, where later training stages cause the model to forget its previously learned skills and knowledge). The RLP-trained model achieved an overall score that was 7-8% higher than baselines after an identical post-training regimen. The researchers conclude that RLP “establishes robust reasoning foundations that are not washed out by downstream alignment but instead compound with post-training.”</p><p>The efficiency of the technique is a key finding. On the Qwen3-1.7B model, RLP improved performance by 17% over standard continuous pre-training and also beat a similar technique called Reinforcement Pretraining via prefix-matching rewards (RPT). This advantage held even when the baseline model was trained with 35 times more data to match the computational cost, confirming the gains come from the method itself, not just more processing.</p><p>Furthermore, RLP demonstrates impressive scalability and versatility, successfully extracting a reasoning signal from general-purpose web data—not just curated datasets. When applied to the hybrid Mamba-Transformer model Nemotron-Nano-12B, <b>RLP achieved a 35% relative improvement over a heavily trained baseline</b> while using just a tiny fraction of the data.</p><p>While these results point toward a more efficient path for building powerful models, Catanzaro frames the innovation as a fundamental shift in the learning process itself, rather than an immediate solution to high training costs. </p><p>&quot;This research is exciting because it offers a shift in how models absorb information during pretraining leading to a smarter learning process,&quot; he explained. &quot;It wouldn’t replace large-scale pretraining, but offer another creative method in building the best possible models.&quot;</p><h3><b>A new foundation for AI training</b></h3><p>Ultimately, RLP points toward a future where pre-training is no longer a monolithic process of next-token prediction. Instead, the next generation of models could be built on a hybrid of objectives, creating AI that learns to think more robustly from day one. Catanzaro offers a powerful analogy to frame this shift:</p><p>&quot;Next-token prediction teaches a model what the world looks like; reinforcement-style objectives like RLP can teach it how to think about what it’s seeing,&quot; he said. &quot;The combination of these two objectives could help models develop deeper, more structured thinking much earlier in training... Tools like RLP can build on top of that foundation, making learning more active, curious, and even more efficient.&quot;</p><p>There is still a lot to learn about the dynamics of reinforcement learning in the pre-training phase, but what seems clear is that “introducing exploration earlier in training opens a new axis for scaling — not just in size, but in how models learn to reason,” Catanzaro said.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>bendee983@gmail.com (Ben Dickson)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/2PTqNZnnwoy3Jnl9Nb0jwP/bceecea29350a1a5646c728208c5baac/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_a_robot_thinking_neon_colors_bc248938-48f9-44e0-8bd0-3a2fd7b9f913.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Echelon's AI agents take aim at Accenture and Deloitte consulting models]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/echelons-ai-agents-take-aim-at-accenture-and-deloitte-consulting-models</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">rcupMZb6jRrX4fgMtkqHp</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/\"><u>Echelon</u></a>, an artificial intelligence startup that automates enterprise software implementations, emerged from stealth mode today with $4.75 million in seed funding led by <a href=\"https://baincapitalventures.com/\"><u>Bain Capital Ventures</u></a>, targeting a fundamental shift in how companies deploy and maintain critical business systems.</p><p>The San Francisco-based company has developed AI agents specifically trained to handle end-to-end <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a> implementations — complex enterprise software deployments that traditionally require months of work by offshore consulting teams and cost companies millions of dollars annually.</p><p>&quot;The biggest barrier to digital transformation isn&#x27;t technology — it&#x27;s the time it takes to implement it,&quot; said Rahul Kayala, Echelon&#x27;s founder and CEO, who previously worked at AI-powered IT company <a href=\"https://www.moveworks.com/\"><u>Moveworks</u></a>. &quot;AI agents are eliminating that constraint entirely, allowing enterprises to experiment, iterate, and deploy platform changes with unprecedented speed.&quot;</p><p>The announcement signals a potential disruption to the<a href=\"https://www.ciodive.com/news/global-ai-spending-trillions-cloud-infrastructure-software-gartner/760303/\"><u> $1.5 trillion global IT services market</u></a>, where companies like <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/\"><u>Accenture</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en.html\"><u>Deloitte</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.capgemini.com/us-en/\"><u>Capgemini</u></a> have long dominated through labor-intensive consulting models that Echelon argues are becoming obsolete in the age of artificial intelligence.</p><h2><b>Why ServiceNow deployments take months and cost millions</b></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a>, a cloud-based platform used by enterprises to manage IT services, human resources, and business workflows, has become critical infrastructure for large organizations. However, implementing and customizing the platform typically requires specialized expertise that most companies lack internally.</p><p>The complexity stems from ServiceNow&#x27;s vast customization capabilities. Organizations often need hundreds of &quot;<a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/blog/service-catalog-migration\"><u>catalog items</u></a>&quot; — digital forms and workflows for employee requests — each requiring specific configurations, approval processes, and integrations with existing systems. According to Echelon&#x27;s research, these implementations frequently stretch far beyond planned timelines due to technical complexity and communication bottlenecks between business stakeholders and development teams.</p><p>&quot;What starts out simple often turns into weeks of effort once the actual work begins,&quot; the company noted in its <a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/blog/service-catalog-migration\"><u>analysis of common implementation challenges</u></a>. &quot;A basic request form turns out to be five requests stuffed into one. We had catalog items with 50+ variables, 10 or more UI policies, all connected. Update one field, and something else would break.&quot;</p><p>The traditional solution involves hiring offshore development teams or expensive consultants, creating what Echelon describes as a problematic cycle: &quot;One question here, one delay there, and suddenly you&#x27;re weeks behind.&quot;</p><h2><b>How AI agents replace expensive offshore consulting teams</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s approach replaces human consultants with AI agents trained by elite <a href=\"https://www.servicenow.com/\"><u>ServiceNow</u></a> experts from top consulting firms. These agents can analyze business requirements, ask clarifying questions in real-time, and automatically generate complete ServiceNow configurations including forms, workflows, testing scenarios, and documentation.</p><p>The technology delivers a significant advancement from general-purpose AI tools. Rather than providing generic code suggestions, Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s specific architecture, best practices, and common integration patterns. They can identify gaps in requirements and propose solutions that align with enterprise governance standards.</p><p>&quot;Instead of routing every piece of input through five people, the business process owner directly uploaded their requirements,&quot; Kayala explained, describing a recent customer implementation. &quot;The AI developer analyzes it and asks follow-up questions like: &#x27;I see a process flow with 3 branches, but only 2 triggers. Should there be a 3rd?&#x27; The kinds of things a seasoned developer would ask. With AI, these questions came instantly.&quot;</p><p>Early customers report dramatic time savings. One financial services company saw a service catalog migration project that was projected to take six months <a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/\"><u>completed in six weeks</u></a> using Echelon&#x27;s AI agents.</p><h2><b>What makes Echelon&#x27;s AI different from coding assistants</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s technology addresses several technical challenges that have prevented broader AI adoption in enterprise software implementation. The agents are trained not just on ServiceNow&#x27;s technical capabilities but on the accumulated expertise of senior consultants who understand complex enterprise requirements, governance frameworks, and integration patterns.</p><p>This approach differs from general-purpose AI coding assistants like <a href=\"https://github.com/features/copilot\"><u>GitHub Copilot</u></a>, which provide syntax suggestions but lack domain-specific expertise. Echelon&#x27;s agents understand ServiceNow&#x27;s data models, security frameworks, and upgrade considerations—knowledge typically acquired through years of consulting experience.</p><p>The company&#x27;s training methodology involves elite ServiceNow experts from consulting firms like <a href=\"https://www.accenture.com/\"><u>Accenture</u></a> and specialized ServiceNow partner <a href=\"https://www.thirdera.com/\"><u>Thirdera</u></a>. This embedded expertise enables the AI to handle complex requirements and edge cases that typically require senior consultant intervention.</p><p>The real challenge isn&#x27;t teaching AI to write code — it&#x27;s capturing the intuitive expertise that separates junior developers from seasoned architects. Senior ServiceNow consultants instinctively know which customizations will break during upgrades and how simple requests spiral into complex integration problems. This institutional knowledge creates a far more defensible moat than general-purpose coding assistants can offer.</p><h2><b>The $1.5 trillion consulting market faces disruption</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s emergence reflects broader trends reshaping the enterprise software market. As companies accelerate digital transformation initiatives, the traditional consulting model increasingly appears inadequate for the speed and scale required.</p><p>ServiceNow itself has grown rapidly, reporting over <a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/now/revenue/\"><u>$10.98 billion in annual revenue in 2024</u></a>, and $12.06 billion for the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, as organizations continue to digitize more business processes. However, this growth has created a persistent talent shortage, with demand for skilled ServiceNow professionals — particularly those with AI expertise — significantly outpacing supply.</p><p>The startup&#x27;s approach could fundamentally alter the economics of enterprise software implementation. Traditional consulting engagements often involve large teams working for months, with costs scaling linearly with project complexity. AI agents, by contrast, can handle multiple projects simultaneously and apply learned knowledge across customers.</p><p>Rak Garg, the Bain Capital Ventures partner who led Echelon&#x27;s funding round, sees this as part of a larger shift toward AI-powered professional services. &quot;We see the same trend with other BCV companies like <a href=\"https://www.prophetsecurity.ai/\"><u>Prophet Security</u></a>, which automates security operations, and <a href=\"https://baincapitalventures.com/insight/crosby-is-redefining-legal-work-with-ai-powered-contract-automation/\"><u>Crosby</u></a>, which automates legal services for startups. AI is quickly becoming the delivery layer across multiple functions.&quot;</p><h2><b>Scaling beyond ServiceNow while maintaining enterprise reliability</b></h2><p>Despite early success, Echelon faces significant challenges in scaling its approach. Enterprise customers prioritize reliability above speed, and any AI-generated configurations must meet strict security and compliance requirements.</p><p>&quot;Inertia is the biggest risk,&quot; Garg acknowledged. &quot;IT systems shouldn&#x27;t ever go down, and companies lose thousands of man-hours of productivity with every outage. Proving reliability at scale, and building on repeatable results will be critical for Echelon.&quot;</p><p>The company plans to expand beyond ServiceNow to other enterprise platforms including <a href=\"https://www.sap.com/index.html\"><u>SAP</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/\"><u>Salesforce</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.workday.com/en-us/homepage.html\"><u>Workday</u></a> — each creating substantial additional market opportunities. However, each platform requires developing new domain expertise and training models on platform-specific best practices.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.echelonai.com/\"><u>Echelon</u></a> also faces potential competition from established consulting firms that are developing their own AI capabilities. However, Garg views these firms as potential partners rather than competitors, noting that many have already approached Echelon about collaboration opportunities.</p><p>&quot;They know that AI is shifting their business model in real-time,&quot; he said. &quot;Customers are placing immense pricing pressure on larger firms and asking hard questions, and these firms can use Echelon agents to accelerate their projects.&quot;</p><h2><b>How AI agents could reshape all professional services</b></h2><p>Echelon&#x27;s funding and emergence from stealth marks a significant milestone in the application of AI to professional services. Unlike consumer AI applications that primarily enhance individual productivity, enterprise AI agents like Echelon&#x27;s directly replace skilled labor at scale.</p><p>The company&#x27;s approach — training AI systems on expert knowledge rather than just technical documentation — could serve as a model for automating other complex professional services. Legal research, financial analysis, and technical consulting all involve similar patterns of applying specialized expertise to unique customer requirements.</p><p>For enterprise customers, the promise extends beyond cost savings to strategic agility. Organizations that can rapidly implement and modify business processes gain competitive advantages in markets where customer expectations and regulatory requirements change frequently.</p><p>As Kayala noted, &quot;This unlocks a completely different approach to business agility and competitive advantage.&quot;</p><p>The implications extend far beyond ServiceNow implementations. If AI agents can master the intricacies of enterprise software deployment—one of the most complex and relationship-dependent areas of professional services — few knowledge work domains may remain immune to automation.</p><p>The question isn&#x27;t whether AI will transform professional services, but how quickly human expertise can be converted into autonomous digital workers that never sleep, never leave for competitors, and get smarter with every project they complete.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Software</category>\n            <category>Enterprise</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/6Wx0cy48ounMBeal2k0YPo/61ea707f3d72649cd7670e2cc4e809b6/nuneybits_Vector_art_of_AI_robot_coding_9f59b4e8-0719-4d4f-8bf3-025933b4c3f3.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[The most important OpenAI announcement you probably missed at DevDay 2025]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-most-important-openai-announcement-you-probably-missed-at-devday-2025</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5vuObQXLYhA0fkYU6uaFO9</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>OpenAI’s annual developer conference on Monday was a spectacle of ambitious AI product launches, from an <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\"><u>app store for ChatGPT</u></a> to a stunning <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\"><u>video-generation API</u></a> that brought creative concepts to life. But for the enterprises and technical leaders watching closely, the most consequential announcement was the quiet <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/codex-now-generally-available/\"><u>general availability of Codex</u></a>, the company&#x27;s AI software engineer. This release signals a profound shift in how software—and by extension, modern business—is built.</p><p>While other announcements captured the public’s imagination, the production-ready release of <a href=\"https://openai.com/codex/\"><u>Codex</u></a>, supercharged by a <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/\"><u>new specialized model</u></a> and a <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk\"><u>suite of enterprise-grade tools</u></a>, is the engine behind OpenAI’s entire vision. It is the tool that builds the tools, the proven agent in a world buzzing with agentic potential, and the clearest articulation of the company&#x27;s strategy to win the enterprise.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/codex-now-generally-available/\"><u>general availability of Codex</u></a> moves it from a &quot;research preview&quot; to a fully supported product, complete with a new <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk\"><u>software development kit (SDK)</u></a>, a <a href=\"https://developers.openai.com/codex/integrations/slack\"><u>Slack integration</u></a>, and administrative controls for security and monitoring.This transition declares that Codex is ready for mission-critical work inside the world’s largest companies.</p><p>&quot;We think this is the best time in history to be a builder; it has never been faster to go from idea to product,&quot; said OpenAI CEO Sam Altman during the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming\"><u>opening keynote</u></a> presentation. &quot;Software used to take months or years to build. You saw that it can take minutes now to build with AI.&quot; </p><p>That acceleration is not theoretical. It&#x27;s a reality born from OpenAI’s own internal use — a massive &quot;dogfooding&quot; effort that serves as the ultimate case study for enterprise customers.</p><h2>Inside GPT-5-Codex: The AI model that codes autonomously for hours and drives 70% productivity gains</h2><p>At the heart of the Codex upgrade is <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/features/codex?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch_brand&amp;utm_campaign=GOOG_B_SEM_GBR_Core_TEM_BAU_ACQ_PER_BRD_ALL_NAMER_US_EN_080625&amp;utm_term=openai%20codex&amp;utm_content=187611721873&amp;utm_ad=776422173331&amp;utm_match=p&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=23071604080&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA-I0E5cl2krVAgcAc2VJzRhsB5CLd&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwup3HBhAAEiwA7euZupI6JVfC5p76PsLMGm1i2XCDyp7ERZnjrRPbaodVfs6hE2MM_g4_zhoCzE4QAvD_BwE\"><u>GPT-5-Codex</u></a>, a version of OpenAI&#x27;s latest flagship model that has been &quot;purposely trained for Codex and agentic coding.&quot; The new model is designed to function as an autonomous teammate, moving far beyond simple code autocompletion.</p><p>&quot;I personally like to think about it as a little bit like a human teammate,&quot; explained Tibo Sottiaux, an OpenAI engineer, during a technical session on Codex. &quot;You can pair a program with it on your computer, you can delegate to it, or as you&#x27;ll see, you can give it a job without explicit prompting.&quot;</p><p>This new model enables &quot;<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-upgrades-to-codex/\"><u>adaptive thinking</u></a>,&quot; allowing it to dynamically adjust the time and computational effort spent on a task based on its complexity.For simple requests, it&#x27;s fast and efficient, but for complex refactoring projects, it can work for hours.</p><p>One engineer during the technical session noted, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the GPT-5-Codex model work for over seven hours productively... on a marathon session.&quot; This capability to handle long-running, complex tasks is a significant leap beyond the simple, single-shot interactions that define most AI coding assistants.</p><p>The results inside OpenAI have been dramatic. The company reported that 92% of its technical staff now uses Codex daily, and those engineers complete 70% more pull requests (a measure of code contribution) each week. Usage has surged tenfold since August. </p><p>&quot;When we as a team see the stats, it feels great,&quot; Sottiaux shared. &quot;But even better is being at lunch with someone who then goes &#x27;Hey I use Codex all the time. Here&#x27;s a cool thing that I do with it. Do you want to hear about it?&#x27;&quot; </p><h2>How OpenAI uses Codex to build its own AI products and catch hundreds of bugs daily</h2><p>Perhaps the most compelling argument for Codex’s importance is that it is the foundational layer upon which OpenAI’s other flashy announcements were built. During the <a href=\"https://devday.openai.com/\"><u>DevDay event</u></a>, the company showcased custom-built arcade games and a dynamic, AI-powered website for the conference itself, all developed using <a href=\"https://openai.com/codex/\"><u>Codex</u></a>.</p><p>In one session, engineers demonstrated how they built &quot;Storyboard,&quot; a custom creative tool for the film industry, in just 48 hours during an internal hackathon. &quot;We decided to test Codex, our coding agent... we would send tasks to Codex in between meetings. We really easily reviewed and merged PRs into production, which Codex even allowed us to do from our phones,&quot; said Allison August, a solutions engineering leader at OpenAI. </p><p>This reveals a critical insight: the rapid innovation showcased at DevDay is a direct result of the productivity flywheel created by <a href=\"https://openai.com/codex/\"><u>Codex</u></a>. The AI is a core part of the manufacturing process for all other AI products.</p><p>A key enterprise-focused feature is the new, more robust code review capability. OpenAI said it &quot;purposely trained GPT-5-Codex to be great at ultra thorough code review,&quot; enabling it to explore dependencies and validate a programmer&#x27;s intent against the actual implementation to find high-quality bugs.Internally, nearly every pull request at OpenAI is now reviewed by Codex, catching hundreds of issues daily before they reach a human reviewer.</p><p>&quot;It saves you time, you ship with more confidence,&quot; Sottiaux said. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing worse than finding a bug after we actually ship the feature.&quot; </p><h2>Why enterprise software teams are choosing Codex over GitHub Copilot for mission-critical development</h2><p>The maturation of <a href=\"https://openai.com/codex/\"><u>Codex</u></a> is central to OpenAI’s broader strategy to conquer the enterprise market, a move essential to justifying its massive valuation and unprecedented compute expenditures. During a press conference, CEO Sam Altman confirmed the strategic shift.</p><p>&quot;The models are there now, and you should expect a huge focus from us on really winning enterprises with amazing products, starting here,&quot; Altman said during a private press conference. </p><p>OpenAI President and Co-founder Greg Brockman immediately added, &quot;And you can see it already with Codex, which I think has been just an incredible success and has really grown super fast.&quot; </p><p>For technical decision-makers, the message is clear.

Zendesk is poised to generate about $200 million in AI-related revenue this year, double than some of its largest competitors, while investing $400 million dollars in R&amp;D. Much of that research is focused on upgrading the Zendesk <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/articles/relate-2025-resolution-platform/\">Resolution Platform</a>, a complete AI-first solution for customer service, employee service, and contact center teams, announced at <a href=\"https://www.zendeskrelate.com/event/de0d1117-2555-4f59-a2a7-8eda8083d5a4/zendesk-relate-2025\">Relate</a> this past March.</p><p>During AI Summit, Chief Executive Officer Tom Eggemeier, along with members of the Zendesk team, took to the stage to announce several major advancements, including voice AI agents, video calling, and screen sharing for Zendesk Contact Center, and improved IT asset management, as well as the introduction of next-generation analytics, in the wake of its <a href=\"https://www.zendesk.com/newsroom/articles/hyperarc-acquisition/\">acquisition of HyperArc</a>.</p><p>&quot;We have built the only platform that is purpose-built for service and purpose-built for AI,&quot; Eggemeier said. &quot;That focus is why we lead in AI for all types of service. And it is why we can deliver what no one else can for every service need you have in your organization.&quot;</p><h3><b>New capabilities across use cases and companies</b></h3><p>At its core, the Resolution Platform powers autonomous AI agents that solve complex issues in real time, leveraging leading LLMs like GPT-5, developed in collaboration with OpenAI, and supporting Model Context Protocol (MCP) to instantly access data, which streamlines workflows and improves autonomous problem-solving. </p><p>&quot;Since our launch in March, we’ve been building fast, focused on making AI agents smarter, more flexible, and ready for even more channels,&quot; said Shashi Upadhyay, president of product, engineering, and AI at Zendesk. &quot;And now, these AI agents are getting even better. They work across messaging, email, and now voice. They are getting smarter; able to handle multiple intents in a single message, detecting, remembering, and resolving many issues at once.&quot;</p><p>The only platform with native built-in QA, resolutions are automatically scored down to the conversation level, so teams can track resolution quality at scale. For startups, these insights are critical. They not only show what worked, but what needs fixing before it costs them time, reputation, or growth, and importantly, fit within a startup budget. That’s because Zendesk is the only company that charges only for successful resolutions, which are verified through the industry’s longest validation window, with two layers of quality checks.</p><h3><b>Making the product CX admin a hero </b></h3><p>Zendesk demonstrated the platform’s new features by highlighting a hypothetical wearable device company’s product launch. Service leaders at every stop along the product launch journey — from design to manufacturing — manage emerging issues with the support of the upgraded Resolution Platform.</p><p>For a global manufacturer that builds complex, state-of-the-art wearable tech, the pressure starts the moment a new product hits the market, tickets start pouring in, and a red-flagged backlog piles up. </p><p>&quot;It is not a product issue, it is a resolution bottleneck,&quot; Upadhyay said. But, he added, &quot;What once took days can now be resolved instantly.&quot; </p><p>The new Zendesk Admin Copilot is designed specifically to assist human agents, helping them spot what is not working, what to do next, and carry out changes quickly. It flags operational issues, like missing intent tags, broken internal processes, or routing conflicts that delay resolution. Copilot explains what is happening in plain language, recommends specific fixes, and with the admin’s approval, can make the changes itself. It&#x27;s grounded in live Zendesk data, like tickets, triggers, and knowledge, so every recommendation is specific, current, and based on how the service operation actually runs. </p><p>Once the admin identifies the issue and implements a fix, the next step is ensuring everyone has access to the right knowledge to support it. For many organizations, that information lives outside of Zendesk. The newly launched Knowledge Connectors allows admins to pull in relevant content, like configuration guides or policy details, without needing to migrate anything so both human and AI agents have access to real-time instructions tied to the exact product version. </p><p>The admin also creates a smarter feedback loop with the new Action Builder, which automatically tags, summarizes, and sends notifications to the product team through Microsoft Teams. </p><p>And finally, Zendesk HyperArc will bring customers insights that combine AI and human analysis in a clear, narrative-driven view of what is happening and why, instead of siloed dashboards or static reports.</p><p>&quot;With these innovations in place, change at the manufacturing plant cascades quickly, tickets are routed cleanly, support agents know what to say, engineering sees real signals instead of scattered anecdotes, and customers who just want the product to work get fast, reliable resolutions,&quot; Upadhyay said. &quot;The CX Admin becomes the quiet hero of the manufacturer’s story.&quot;</p><h3><b>Solutions for the retail CX leader</b></h3><p>As a CX or contact center leader for a retail company, when a must-have wearable drops, how do you deliver service for your new hit product that feels personal and consistent when your team is stretched across multiple countries, channels, and customer expectations at once? </p><p>&quot;Intelligent automation doesn’t just streamline operations — it enhances the customer experience across borders and channels,&quot; said Lisa Kant, senior vice president of marketing at Zendesk. </p><p>Zendesk’s Voice AI Agents are fully autonomous AI agents designed to understand natural speech, take action, and resolve issues without needing to escalate. They can verify identity, track orders, update deliveries, and answer setup questions in multiple languages, while keeping the brand experience consistent. Meanwhile, Video Calling lets a live agent spin up a video session, confirm the device is working, and walk the customer through setup or troubleshooting. </p><p>And because a help center is a critical part of delivering great service, especially when scaling fast across multiple countries and languages, Zendesk built Knowledge Builder, an AI-powered tool that helps teams build and maintain their help center content automatically. It analyzes real customer conversations and turns them into localized help articles for trending issues.</p><h3><b>Giving IT leaders a strong edge </b></h3><p>When a company adopts that new product, it becomes critical to resolve issues fast, to ensure employee productivity stays strong. Available with early access in November, Zendesk&#x27;s new employee service offering, IT Asset Management (ITAM), natively integrates service and asset data together into the Zendesk service desk to help IT move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive service. </p><p>Now, when a vague “tablet not working” ticket comes in, Zendesk ITAM surfaces the device details right inside the ticket, so IT knows exactly what they are dealing with. Zendesk Copilot uses that same asset data to recommend model-specific troubleshooting steps. And with Knowledge Connectors, those steps can be pulled directly from SharePoint or Confluence without migration. If the fix does not work, the IT specialist confirms in seconds that the device is under warranty and issues a replacement without any back-and-forth. </p><p>With real-time visibility across every hardware asset, the IT leader can spot patterns before they become a flood of tickets, or failures at the point of care, so IT resolves issues faster and prevents problems before they happen. </p><p>&quot;With Zendesk, IT is not just reacting to issues — it is setting the standard for how proactive employee service is delivered,&quot; Upadhyay said.</p><p><i>For more on the latest Zendesk updates and improvements, and to watch a conversation with Zendesk&#x27;s special guest, co-founder of LinkedIn, Reid Hoffman, and more, </i><a href=\"https://virtualevents.zendeskai-summit.com/series/ai-summit-2025-video-hub/landing_page?utm_source=press&amp;utm_medium=crosspromo&amp;utm_campaign=ai_summit_press_Global_2025Q4\"><i>watch the full videos here</i></a><i>.

And AI companies are seeing an opportunity to bring more and more <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/habib-at-vb-transform-writers-vision-for-full-stack-ai\"><u>AI services into one platform</u></a>, even integrating into where employees do their work. </p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a>’s ChatGPT, although still a separate window, is gradually <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-announces-apps-sdk-allowing-chatgpt-to-launch-and-run-third-party\"><u>introducing more integrations</u></a> into its platform. Rivals like <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><u>Google</u></a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/\"><u>Amazon Web Services</u></a> believe they can compete with new platforms directly aiming at enterprise users who want a more streamlined AI experience. And these two new platforms are the latest volley in the race to bring enterprise AI users into one central place for their AI needs. </p><p>Google and AWS are separately introducing new platforms designed for full-stack agent workflow, hoping to usher in a world where users don’t need to open other windows to access agents. </p><p>Google unveiled Gemini Enterprise, a platform that Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said “brings the best of Google AI to every employee.” Meanwhile, AWS announced Quick Suite, a series of services intended to exist as a browser extension for enterprises to call on agents. </p><p>Both these platforms aim to keep enterprise employees working within one ecosystem, keeping the needed context in more local storage. </p><h2>Quick Suite</h2><p>AWS, through Bedrock, allowed enterprises to build applications and agents, test them, and then deploy them in a single space. However, Bedrock remains a backend tool. AWS is banking that organizations will want a better way to access those agents without leaving their workspace. </p><p>Quick Suite will be AWS’s front-facing agentic application for enterprises. It will also be a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox and accessible on Microsoft Outlook, Word and Slack. </p><p>AWS vice president for Agentic AI Swami Sivasubramanian said Quick Suite is the company’s way of “entering a new era of work,” in that it gives employees access to AI applications they like with privacy considerations and context from their enterprise data. </p><p>Quick Suite connects with Adobe Analytics, SharePoint, Snowflake, Google Drive, OneDrive, Outlook, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Slack, Databricks, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon S3. Through MCP servers, users can also access information from Atlassian, Asana, Box, Canva, PagerDuty, Workato or Zapier. </p><p>The platform consists of several services users can toggle to:</p><ul><li><p>An agent builder accessible through a chat assistant </p></li><li><p>Quick Sight to analyze and visualize data</p></li><li><p>Quick Research, which can find information and build out research reports. Users can choose to limit the search to internal or uploaded documents only or to access the internet</p></li><li><p>Quick Flows to allow people to build routine tasks through simple prompts</p></li><li><p>Quick Automate for more complicated workflows, where the model can begin coordinating agents and data sharing to complete tasks</p></li></ul><p>AWS said it orchestrates through several foundation models to power Quick Suite’s services. </p><h2>Gemini Enterprise</h2><p>Google had already begun offering enterprise AI solutions, often in fragmented products. Its newest offering, Gemini Enterprise, brings together the company’s AI offerings in a single place. Products like <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-is-redefining-enterprise-ai-economics-with-open-source-gemini-cli-that-will-be-free-for-the-majority-of-developers\"><u>Gemini CLI</u></a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-vids-ai-video-creation-app-in-workspace\"><u>Google Vids</u></a> will be integrated and accessible through Gemini Enterprise. </p><p>“By bringing all of these components together through a single interface, Gemini Enterprise transforms how teams work,” Kurian said in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EY5WMNkFENqnue0EVGpiVQTAHVWMcTzk6UboUDdn-w8/preview?tab=t.0#bookmark=id.6pr39wahvxe1\"><u>a blog post</u></a>.</p><p>It is powered by Gemini models and connects to an enterprise’s data sources. Gemini always connected to Google’s Workspace services, such as Docs and Drive, but Gemini Enterprise can now grab information from Microsoft 365 or other platforms like Salesforce. </p><p>The idea behind Gemini Enterprise is to offer “a no-code workbench” for any user to surface information and orchestrate agents for automation. The platform includes pre-built agents for deep research and insights, but customers can also bring in their own or third-party agents. </p><p>Administrators can manage these agents and workflows through a visual governance framework within Gemini Enterprise. </p><p>Google said some customers have already begun using Gemini Enterprise, including Macquarie Bank, legal AI provider Harvey and Banco BV. </p><p>Google told VentureBeat that other platforms, like Vertex AI, remain separate products. Pricing for Gemini Enterprise, both the standard and pulse editions, start at $30 per seat per month. A new pricing tier, Gemini Business, costs $21/seat per month for a year. </p><h2>Uninterrupted work in one place</h2><p>In many ways, enterprise AI was always going to move to this more <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/unleashing-the-potential-of-ai-the-power-of-an-end-to-end-environment-for-innovation\"><u>full-stack, end-to-end environment</u></a> where people access all AI tools in one place. After all, fragmented offerings and lost context turn off many employees who already have a lot on their plates. </p><p>Removing the friction of moving windows and possibly losing context to what you’re working on could save people a lot more time, and make the idea of using an AI agent or chatbot more appealing. This was the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-launches-chatgpt-desktop-integrations-rivaling-copilot\"><u>reasoning behind OpenAI’s decision</u></a> to create a desktop app for ChatGPT and why we see so many product announcements around integrations. </p><p>But now, competitors have to offer more differentiated platforms or they risk being labeled as copycats of products most people already use. I felt the same during a Quick Suite demo, thinking it felt like ChatGPT. </p><p>The battle to be the one full-stack platform for the enterprise is just beginning. And as more AI tools and agents become more useful for employees, there will be more demand to make calling up these services as simple as a tap from their preferred workspace. </p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/9w5D1Pdi01jrnTmHGWnBE/a95c3ffe6198418598ec508d069e8bbc/crimedy7_illustration_of_a_robot_coding_a_program_--ar_169_--_7dafd9d4-817a-4c5c-abbe-fb9112e639c7_1.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Capturing the trillion dollar opportunity with autonomous professional services]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/capturing-the-trillion-dollar-opportunity-with-autonomous-professional</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">4C0osKxSCL8JIlr4cneeZu</guid>\n            <pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p><i>Presented by Certinia</i></p><hr/><p>Every professional services leader knows the feeling: a pipeline full of promising deals, but a bench that’s already stretched thin. </p><p>That’s because growth has always been tied to a finite supply of consultants with finite availability to work on projects. Even with strong market demand, most firms only capture 10-20% of their potential pipeline because they simply can’t staff the work fast enough. Professional Services Automation (PSA) software emerged to help optimize operations, but the core model has remained the same.</p><p>Thankfully, that limitation is about to change. The proliferation of AI agents is sparking a new model — <i>Autonomous PSA</i> — blending human expertise with a digital workforce, all managed by a central orchestration engine. The result is a system that allows firms to capture 70-90% of demand instead of leaving it on the table. </p><h3>Why professional services has the biggest transformation opportunity with agentic AI</h3><p>Many industries will be transformed by AI agents, but perhaps none more than professional services. Understanding why requires us to explore the difference between current-state automation and future-state autonomy.</p><p>Traditional automation follows pre-set rules: <i>When X happens, do Y.</i> It&#x27;s a logical workflow. Autonomy, on the other hand, is goal-oriented: <i>The goal is Z. Analyze the data, select and deploy the best resources, and execute the necessary steps to achieve Z.</i> It’s the difference between executing a workflow, and executing a full-on strategy.</p><p>This distinction is key because the core operation of a professional services business is a complex strategy. Unlike a sales team managing a linear pipeline or a support team clearing a reactive queue, a services firm is constantly solving a multi-dimensional problem. The &quot;product&quot; isn&#x27;t a license or a physical item; it&#x27;s the expertise of its people, working on a diverse set of tasks, typically delivered over discrete units of time.</p><p>That means the business model of a services organization contains layers of operational complexity that product-based businesses inherently get to avoid. The manual effort and guesswork involved often lead to conservative bidding on new business, underutilized experts, and reactive staffing that can put project margins and timelines at risk. Added up, this complexity represents a trillion-dollar opportunity cost for the global services economy.</p><h3>The orchestration engine that makes autonomous PSA possible</h3><p>“Autonomous PSA” describes an intelligent system designed to manage and orchestrate a blended team of human experts and their AI agent counterparts. It works by integrating a digital workforce of AI agents directly into your service delivery operations, providing a nearly limitless supply of labor for repeatable tasks, all governed by a single engine. It&#x27;s a fundamental shift from a model constrained by human supply to one amplified by digital scale.</p><p>There is one enterprise software ecosystem uniquely positioned to make Autonomous PSA possible: Salesforce. Autonomous PSA emerges from the combination of three of its core technologies:</p><p><b>The Salesforce platform as the foundation: </b>Everything will start with a single source of truth. The Salesforce platform provides the unified data fabric for every aspect of the customer relationship. This foundation extends across the entire platform, giving the autonomous engine the complete data context it needs to function. </p><p><b>Agentforce as the AI engine:</b> Agentforce represents the industry’s most secure, trusted layer for building and deploying AI agents that provide digital labor. It gives organizations the power to execute complex tasks at scale, transforming AI capabilities from concept to a tangible part of the future resource pool. </p><p><b>Salesforce-native Professional Services Automation software as the orchestration brain:</b> The data foundation and AI engine need a command center. A Salesforce-native solution for Professional Services Automation like <a href=\"https://www.certinia.com/solutions/?utm_source=salesforceben&amp;utm_campaign=brand-aware-demand-gen_nam_ent_tofu&amp;utm_content=exec-leadership\">Certinia</a> acts as the orchestration brain that defines the goals, rules, and workflows for the agents, deploying them alongside human resources to optimize project outcomes from sale to delivery.</p><p>The keystone of this new model is the orchestration brain, akin to a control tower for the hybrid human-AI agent workforce. It’s a system built to manage an elastic supply of resources, instantly scaling delivery by pairing consultants with digital agents. Instead of scrambling with spreadsheets, staffing becomes a real-time, AI-driven allocation based on skills, availability, and project needs.</p><div></div><p>The combination creates a unified platform that gives the orchestration engine the context it needs for smarter, faster decision-making across the entire project lifecycle.</p><p>For executives, the impact is direct. Now empowered to overcome human capacity limits, PSOs can expand pipeline capture from a mere 10–20% to as high as 70–90%. This growth is also more profitable, as margins improve when lower-value work is offloaded to digital labor, allowing people to focus on high-value delivery. Furthermore, project timelines are accelerated, with 24/7 AI capacity shortening schedules and speeding time-to-value. </p><p>Crucially, this speed and efficiency do not come at the expense of quality; human oversight remains embedded in every engagement, ensuring client trust is maintained through strong governance.</p><h3>Preparing your organization for autonomous PSA</h3><p>Adapting to Autonomous Professional Services requires leadership and foresight. For organizations ready to start, the journey begins with three key steps:</p><p><b>Re-architect your workforce model.</b> The traditional pyramid workforce hierarchy is shifting to a diamond structure with AI agents handling the base of repeatable work. This will create new roles like orchestration analysts and agent supervisors to manage this blended workforce. Your first move is to audit your delivery processes and identify the high-volume, low-complexity tasks primed for this new digital workforce.</p><p><b>Invest in a native orchestration engine.</b> An autonomous system needs a central brain. This is your PSA solution, and it must be native to your CRM platform to access real-time data across sales, service, and finance. If your project, resource, and financial data live in different systems, your priority is to unify them on a single platform to create the foundation for intelligent decision-making.</p><p><b>Experiment, then scale.</b> Don&#x27;t try to transform everything at once. Start by automating a single, high-friction process, like project creation from a closed-won opportunity or initial budget drafting. Proving value on a small scale builds the business case and the operational muscle for a systematic expansion across your entire services lifecycle.</p><h3>Model behind the trillion-dollar ppportunity </h3><p>Our analysis from over 2000 global professional services organizations indicates that firms today leave most of their pipeline untouched. With human capacity alone, they typically capture only 10–20% of qualified demand. By blending digital labor into the mix, that capacity can rise to 70–90%. The difference—what we call ΔR—is massive. For a large professional services organization (PSO) with a $6B pipeline, that shift alone unlocks about $3.6B in incremental revenue.</p><p>And that is just the starting point. Once you add amplifiers like faster delivery (acceleration), lower delivery cost (margin gains), and access to niche expertise (skill-gap coverage), the impact multiplies. In our model, those amplifiers nearly triple the base gain, raising the total opportunity to $10 Billion per firm. Scale that across 100 of the world’s largest PSOs, and you arrive at the trillion-dollar prize.</p><h3>Seize the full market potential</h3><p>The idea presented here represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the economics of professional services. Firms that adopt Autonomous PSA will capture a greater share of demand, deliver faster outcomes, and free their experts to focus on what matters most: client success.</p><p>The era of Autonomous Professional Services has begun. The orchestration engine is the key. How quickly will your organization seize the opportunity?</p><p><i><b>The full framework and analytical model are detailed in this new white paper, </b></i><a href=\"https://www.certinia.com/blog/how-autonomous-psa-will-unlock-a-trillion-dollar-market-opportunity/?utm_source=venturebeat&amp;utm_campaign=people-and-work_nam_ent_tofu&amp;utm_content=pr\"><b><i>Unlocking a Trillion Dollar Opportunity for Professional Services with Autonomous PSA</i></b></a><i><b>.

That paints a very different picture from recent academic forecasts suggesting widespread AI project stagnation.</p><p>As one of the world’s largest crowdsourced software review platforms, G2’s dataset reflects real-world adoption trends — which show that AI agents are proving far more durable and “sticky” than early generative AI pilots.</p><p>“Our report’s really pointing out that agentic is a different beast when it comes to AI with respect to failure or success,” Tim Sanders, G2’s head of research, told VentureBeat. </p><h2>Handing off to AI in customer service, BI, software development</h2><p>Sanders points out that the now oft-referenced <a href=\"https://mlq.ai/media/quarterly_decks/v0.1_State_of_AI_in_Business_2025_Report.pdf\"><u>MIT study</u></a>, released in July, only considered gen AI custom projects, Sanders argues, and many media outlets generalized that to AI failing 95% of the time. He points out that university researchers analyzed public announcements, rather than closed-loop data. If companies didn’t announce a P&amp;L impact, their projects were considered a failure — even if they really weren’t. </p><p>G2’s <a href=\"https://www.g2.com/agents\"><u>2025 AI Agents Insights Report</u></a>, by contrast, surveyed more than 1,300 B2B decision-makers, finding that: </p><ul><li><p>57% of companies have agents in production and 70% say agents are “core to operations”;</p></li><li><p>83% of are satisfied with agent performance;</p></li><li><p>Enterprises are now investing an average of $1 million-plus annually, with 1 in 4 spending $5 million-plus; </p></li><li><p>9 out of 10 plan to increase that investment over the next 12 months; </p></li><li><p>Organizations have seen 40% cost savings, 23% faster workflows, and 1 in 3 report 50%-plus speed gains, particularly in marketing and saless;</p></li><li><p>Nearly 90% of study participants reported higher employee satisfaction in departments where agents were deployed.</p></li></ul><p>The leading use cases for AI agents? Customer service, business intelligence (BI) and software development. </p><p>Interestingly, G2 found a “surprising number” (about 1 in 3) of what Sanders calls ‘let it rip’ organizations. </p><p>“They basically allowed the agent to do a task and then they would either roll it back immediately if it was a bad action, or do QA so that they could retract the bad actions very, very quickly,” he explained. </p><p>At the same time, though, agent programs with a human in the loop were twice as likely to deliver cost savings — 75% or more — than fully autonomous agent strategies.</p><p>This reflects what Sanders called a “dead heat” between ‘let it rip’ organizations and ‘leave some human gates’ organizations. “There&#x27;s going to be a human in the loop years from now,” he said. “Over half of our respondents told us there&#x27;s more human oversight than we expected.” </p><p>However, nearly half of IT buyers are comfortable with granting agents full autonomy in low-risk workflows such as data remediation or data pipeline management. Meanwhile, think of BI and research as prep work, Sanders said; agents gather information in the background to prepare humans to make last passes and final decisions. </p><p>A classic example of this is a mortgage loan, Sanders noted: Agents do everything right up until the human analyzes their findings and yay or nays the loan. </p><p>If there are mistakes, they&#x27;re in the background. “It just doesn&#x27;t publish on your behalf and put your name on it,” said Sanders. “So as a result, you trust it more. You use it more.” </p><p>When it comes to specific deployment methods, Salesforce&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/\">Agentforce</a> “is winning” over ready-made agents and in-house builds, taking up 38% of all market share, Sanders reported. However, many organizations seem to be going hybrid with a goal to eventually stand up in-house tools. </p><p>Then, because they want a trusted source of data, “they&#x27;re going to crystallize around Microsoft, ServiceNow, Salesforce, companies with a real system of record,” he predicted. </p><h2>AI agents aren&#x27;t deadline-driven</h2><p>Why are agents (in some instances at least) so much better than humans? Sanders pointed to a concept called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson&#x27;s_law\"><u>Parkinson&#x27;s Law</u></a>, which states that ‘work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.’</p><p>“Individual productivity doesn&#x27;t lead to organizational productivity because humans are only really driven by deadlines,” said Sanders. When organizations looked at gen AI projects, they didn’t move the goal posts; the deadlines didn’t change. </p><p>“The only way that you fix that is to either move the goal post up or deal with non-humans, because non-humans aren&#x27;t subject to Parkinson&#x27;s Law,” he said, pointing out that they’re not afflicted with “the human procrastination syndrome.”</p><p>Agents don&#x27;t take breaks. They don&#x27;t get distracted. “They just grind so you don&#x27;t have to change the deadlines,” said Sanders. </p><p>“If you focus on faster and faster QA cycles that may even be automated, you fix your agents faster than you fix your humans.” </p><h2>Start with business problems, understand that trust is a slow build</h2><p>Still, Sanders sees AI following the cloud when it comes to trust: He remembers in 2007 when everyone was quick to deploy cloud tools; then by 2009 or 2010, “there was kind of a trough of trust.” </p><p>Mix this in with security concerns: 39% of all respondents to G2’s survey said they’d experienced a <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/security/ai-sharpens-threat-detection-but-could-it-dull-human-analyst-skills\"><u>security incident</u></a> since deploying AI; 25% of the time, it was severe. Sanders emphasized that companies must think about measuring in milliseconds how quickly an agent can be retrained to never repeat a bad action again. </p><p>Always include IT operations in AI deployments, he advised. They know what went wrong with gen AI and robotic process automation (RPA) and can get to the bottom of explainability, which leads to a lot more trust. </p><p>On the flip side, though: Don&#x27;t blindly trust vendors. In fact, only half of respondents said they did; Sanders noted that the No. 1 trust signal is agent explainability. “In qualitative interviews, we were told over and over again, if you [a vendor] can&#x27;t explain it, you can&#x27;t deploy it and manage it.” </p><p>It’s also critical to begin with the business problem and work backwards, he advised: Don&#x27;t buy agents, then look for a proof of concept. If leaders apply agents to the biggest pain points, internal users will be more forgiving when incidents occur, and more willing to iterate, therefore building up their skillsets. </p><p>“People still don&#x27;t trust the cloud, they definitely don&#x27;t trust gen AI, they might not trust agents until they experience it, and then the game changes,” said Sanders. “Trust arrives on a mule — you don’t just get forgiveness.”</p>]]></description>\n            <author>taryn.plumb@venturebeat.com (Taryn Plumb)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5mIuAF6rRa5YJq9dkzNaRb/3bb2774412459aecbe9e0718901209d7/u7277289442_AI_agents_and_human_workers_sit_side-by-side_at_com_4680144f-3cfb-4bf3-9663-98adb31cb8e2.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[New memory framework builds AI agents that can handle the real world's unpredictability]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/new-memory-framework-builds-ai-agents-that-can-handle-the-real-worlds</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">jcjVxRqmMIQjE2CvG6nmR</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 23:35:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Researchers at the <a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\"><u>University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign</u></a> and <a href=\"https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai-research/\"><u>Google Cloud AI Research</u></a> have developed a framework that enables large language model (LLM) agents to organize their experiences into a memory bank, helping them get better at complex tasks over time.</p><p>The framework, called <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25140\"><u>ReasoningBank</u></a>, distills “generalizable reasoning strategies” from an agent’s successful and failed attempts to solve problems. The agent then uses this memory during inference to avoid repeating past mistakes and make better decisions as it faces new problems. The researchers show that when combined with <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/how-test-time-scaling-unlocks-hidden-reasoning-abilities-in-small-language-models-and-allows-them-to-outperform-llms\"><u>test-time scaling techniques</u></a>, where an agent makes multiple attempts at a problem, ReasoningBank significantly improves the performance and efficiency of LLM agents.</p><p>Their findings show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms classic memory mechanisms across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, offering a practical path toward building more adaptive and reliable AI agents for enterprise applications.</p><h2>The challenge of LLM agent memory</h2><p>As LLM agents are deployed in applications that run for long periods, they encounter a continuous stream of tasks. One of the key limitations of current LLM agents is their failure to learn from this accumulated experience. By approaching each task in isolation, they inevitably repeat past mistakes, discard valuable insights from related problems, and fail to develop skills that would make them more capable over time.</p><p>The solution to this limitation is to give agents some kind of memory. Previous efforts to give agents memory have focused on storing past interactions for reuse by organizing information in various forms from plain text to structured graphs. However, these approaches often fall short. Many use raw interaction logs or only store successful task examples. This means they can&#x27;t distill higher-level, transferable reasoning patterns and, crucially, they don’t extract and use the valuable information from the agent’s failures. As the researchers note in their paper, “existing memory designs often remain limited to passive record-keeping rather than providing actionable, generalizable guidance for future decisions.”</p><h2>How ReasoningBank works</h2><p>ReasoningBank is a memory framework designed to overcome these limitations. Its central idea is to distill useful strategies and reasoning hints from past experiences into structured memory items that can be stored and reused.</p><p>According to Jun Yan, a Research Scientist at Google and co-author of the paper, this marks a fundamental shift in how agents operate. &quot;Traditional agents operate statically—each task is processed in isolation,&quot; Yan explained. &quot;ReasoningBank changes this by turning every task experience (successful or failed) into structured, reusable reasoning memory. As a result, the agent doesn’t start from scratch with each customer; it recalls and adapts proven strategies from similar past cases.&quot;</p><p>The framework processes both successful and failed experiences and turns them into a collection of useful strategies and preventive lessons. The agent judges success and failure through <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-self-taught-evaluator-enables-llms-to-create-their-own-training-data\"><u>LLM-as-a-judge schemes</u></a> to obviate the need for human labeling.</p><p>Yan provides a practical example of this process in action. An agent tasked with finding Sony headphones might fail because its broad search query returns over 4,000 irrelevant products. &quot;ReasoningBank will first try to figure out why this approach failed,&quot; Yan said. &quot;It will then distill strategies such as ‘optimize search query’ and ‘confine products with category filtering.’ Those strategies will be extremely useful to get future similar tasks successfully done.&quot;</p><p>The process operates in a closed loop. When an agent faces a new task, it uses an embedding-based search to retrieve relevant memories from ReasoningBank to guide its actions. These memories are inserted into the agent’s system prompt, providing context for its decision-making. Once the task is completed, the framework creates new memory items to extract insights from successes and failures. This new knowledge is then analyzed, distilled, and merged into the ReasoningBank, allowing the agent to continuously evolve and improve its capabilities.</p><h2>Supercharging memory with scaling</h2><p>The researchers found a powerful synergy between memory and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/deepmind-new-inference-time-scaling-technique-improves-planning-accuracy-in-llms\"><u>test-time scaling</u></a>. Classic test-time scaling involves generating multiple independent answers to the same question, but the researchers argue that this “vanilla form is suboptimal because it does not leverage inherent contrastive signal that arises from redundant exploration on the same problem.”</p><p>To address this, they propose Memory-aware Test-Time Scaling (MaTTS), which integrates scaling with ReasoningBank. MaTTS comes in two forms. In “parallel scaling,” the system generates multiple trajectories for the same query, then compares and contrasts them to identify consistent reasoning patterns. In sequential scaling, the agent iteratively refines its reasoning within a single attempt, with the intermediate notes and corrections also serving as valuable memory signals.</p><p>This creates a virtuous cycle: the existing memory in ReasoningBank steers the agent toward more promising solutions, while the diverse experiences generated through scaling enable the agent to create higher-quality memories to store in ReasoningBank. </p><p>“This positive feedback loop positions memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension for agents,” the researchers write.</p><h2>ReasoningBank in action</h2><p>The researchers tested their framework on <a href=\"https://webarena.dev/\"><u>WebArena </u></a>(web browsing) and <a href=\"https://www.swebench.com/\"><u>SWE-Bench-Verified</u></a> (software engineering) benchmarks, using models like Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet. They compared ReasoningBank against baselines including memory-free agents and agents using trajectory-based or workflow-based memory frameworks.</p><p>The results show that ReasoningBank consistently outperforms these baselines across all datasets and LLM backbones. On WebArena, it improved the overall success rate by up to 8.3 percentage points compared to a memory-free agent. It also generalized better on more difficult, cross-domain tasks, while reducing the number of interaction steps needed to complete tasks. When combined with MaTTS, both parallel and sequential scaling further boosted performance, consistently outperforming standard test-time scaling.</p><p>This efficiency gain has a direct impact on operational costs. Yan points to a case where a memory-free agent took eight trial-and-error steps just to find the right product filter on a website. &quot;Those trial and error costs could be avoided by leveraging relevant insights from ReasoningBank,&quot; he noted. &quot;In this case, we save almost twice the operational costs,&quot; which also improves the user experience by resolving issues faster.</p><p>For enterprises, ReasoningBank can help develop cost-effective agents that can learn from experience and adapt over time in complex workflows and areas like software development, customer support, and data analysis. As the paper concludes, “Our findings suggest a practical pathway toward building adaptive and lifelong-learning agents.”</p><p>Yan confirmed that their findings point toward a future of truly compositional intelligence. For example, a coding agent could learn discrete skills like API integration and database management from separate tasks. &quot;Over time, these modular skills... become building blocks the agent can flexibly recombine to solve more complex tasks,&quot; he said, suggesting a future where agents can autonomously assemble their knowledge to manage entire workflows with minimal human oversight.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>bendee983@gmail.com (Ben Dickson)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/39zNK5TPsGY3tZEmUTjk69/dd9b6dccec081ae2be6dea6d03bac8a1/Robot_arranging_memory.jpg\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/jpg\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[To scale agentic AI, Notion tore down its tech stack and started fresh]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/to-scale-agentic-ai-notion-tore-down-its-tech-stack-and-started-fresh</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">5MqQ3qRMIwDmlYOr8NeKk4</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 21:08:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Many organizations would be hesitant to overhaul their tech stack and start from scratch. \n\nNot <a href=\"https://www.notion.com/\">Notion</a>. \n\nFor the 3.0 version of its productivity software (released in September), the company didn’t hesitate to rebuild from the ground up; they recognized that it was necessary, in fact, to support agentic AI at enterprise scale.\n\nWhereas traditional AI-powered workflows involve explicit, step-by-step instructions based on few-shot learning, AI agents powered by advanced reasoning models are thoughtful about tool definition, can identify and comprehend what tools they have at their disposal and plan next steps. \n\n“Rather than trying to retrofit into what we were building, we wanted to play to the strengths of reasoning models,” Sarah Sachs, Notion’s head of AI modeling, told VentureBeat. “We&#x27;ve rebuilt a new architecture because workflows are different from agents.”</p><h2>Re-orchestrating so models can work autonomously</h2><p><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/notion-bets-big-on-integrated-llms-adds-gpt-4-1-and-claude-3-7-to-platform\">Notion</a> has been adopted by 94% of Forbes AI 50 companies, has 100 million total users and counts among its customers OpenAI, Cursor, Figma, Ramp and Vercel. \n\nIn a rapidly evolving AI landscape, the company identified the need to move beyond simpler, task-based workflows to goal-oriented reasoning systems that allow agents to autonomously select, orchestrate, and execute tools across connected environments. </p><p>Very quickly, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/teaching-the-model-designing-llm-feedback-loops-that-get-smarter-over-time\">reasoning models</a> have become “far better” at learning to use tools and follow chain-of-thought (CoT) instructions, Sachs noted. This allows them to be “far more independent” and make multiple decisions within one agentic workflow. “We rebuilt our AI system to play to that,&quot; she said. \n\nFrom an engineering perspective, this meant replacing rigid prompt-based flows with a unified orchestration model, Sachs explained. This core model is supported by modular sub-agents that search Notion and the web, query and add to databases and edit content. \n\nEach agent uses tools contextually; for instance, they can decide whether to search Notion itself, or another platform like Slack. The model will perform successive searches until the relevant information is found. It can then, for instance, convert notes into proposals, create follow-up messages, track tasks, and spot and make updates in knowledge bases. \n\nIn Notion 2.0, the team focused on having AI perform specific tasks, which required them to “think exhaustively” about how to prompt the model, Sachs noted. However, with version 3.0, users can assign tasks to agents, and agents can actually take action and perform multiple tasks concurrently.  \n\n“We reorchestrated it to be self-selecting on the tools, rather than few-shotting, which is explicitly prompting how to go through all these different scenarios,” Sachs explained. The aim is to ensure everything interfaces with AI and that “anything you can do, your Notion agent can do.”</p><h2>Bifurcating to isolate hallucinations</h2><p>Notion’s philosophy of “better, faster, cheaper,” drives a continuous iteration cycle that balances latency and accuracy through fine-tuned vector embeddings and elastic search optimization. Sachs’ team employs a rigorous evaluation framework that combines deterministic tests, vernacular optimization, human-annotated data and LLMs-as-a-judge, with model-based scoring identifying discrepancies and inaccuracies. \n\n“By bifurcating the evaluation, we&#x27;re able to identify where the problems come from, and that helps us isolate unnecessary hallucinations,” Sachs explained. Further, making the architecture itself simpler means it’s easier to make changes as models and techniques evolve. \n\n“We optimize latency and parallel thinking as much as possible,” which leads to “way better accuracy,” Sachs noted. Models are grounded in data from the web and the Notion connected workspace. \n\nUltimately, Sachs reported, the investment in rebuilding its architecture has already provided Notion returns in terms of capability and faster rate of change. \n\nShe added, “We are fully open to rebuilding it again, when the next breakthrough happens, if we have to.”</p><h2>Understanding contextual latency</h2><p>When building and fine-tuning models, it’s important to understand that latency is subjective: AI must provide the most relevant information, not necessarily the most, at the cost of speed. \n\n“You&#x27;d be surprised at the different ways customers are willing to wait for things and not wait for things,” Sachs said. It makes for an interesting experiment: How slow can you go before people abandon the model?\n\nWith pure navigational search, for instance, users may not be as patient; they want answers near-immediately. “If you ask, ‘What&#x27;s two plus two,’ you don&#x27;t want to wait for your agent to be searching everywhere in Slack and JIRA,” Sachs pointed out. \n\nBut the longer the time it&#x27;s given, the more exhaustive a reasoning agent can be. For instance, Notion can perform <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-anti-chatgpt-thomson-reuters-multi-agent-system-slashes-20-hour-tasks-to\">20 minutes of autonomous work</a> across hundreds of websites, files and other materials. In these instances, users are more willing to wait, Sachs explained; they allow the model to execute in the background while they attend to other tasks. \n\n“It&#x27;s a product question,” said Sachs. “How do we set user expectations from the UI? How do we ascertain user expectations on latency?”</p><h2>Notion is its biggest user</h2><p>Notion understands the importance of using its own product — in fact, its employees are among its biggest power users. \n\nSachs explained that teams have active sandboxes that generate training and evaluation data, as well as a “really active” thumbs-up-thumbs-down user feedback loop. Users aren’t shy about saying what they think should be improved or features they’d like to see. \n\nSachs emphasized that when a user thumbs down an interaction, they are explicitly giving permission to a human annotator to analyze that interaction in a way that de-anonymizes them as much as possible. \n\n“We are using our own tool as a company all day, every day, and so we get really fast feedback loops,” said Sachs. “We’re really dogfooding our own product.” \n\nThat said, it’s their own product they’re building, Sachs noted, so they understand that they may have goggles on when it comes to quality and functionality. To balance this out, Notion has trusted &quot;very AI-savvy&quot; design partners who are granted early access to new capabilities and provide important feedback. \n\nSachs emphasized that this is just as important as internal prototyping. \n\n“We&#x27;re all about experimenting in the open, I think you get much richer feedback,” said Sachs. “Because at the end of the day, if we just look at how Notion uses Notion, we&#x27;re not really giving the best experience to our customers.” \n\nJust as importantly, continuous internal testing allows teams to evaluate progressions and make sure models aren&#x27;t regressing (when accuracy and performance degrades over time). &quot;Everything you&#x27;re doing stays faithful,&quot; Sachs explained. &quot;You know that your latency is within bounds.&quot; </p><p>Many companies make the mistake of focusing too intensely on retroactively-focused evans; this makes it difficult for them to understand how or where they&#x27;re improving, Sachs pointed out. Notion considers evals as a &quot;litmus test&quot; of development and forward-looking progression and evals of observability and regression proofing. \n\n“I think a big mistake a lot of companies make is conflating the two,” said Sachs. “We use them for both purposes; we think about them really differently.”</p><h2>Takeaways from Notion&#x27;s journey</h2><p>For enterprises, Notion can serve as a blueprint for how to responsibly and dynamically operationalize agentic AI in a connected, permissioned enterprise workspace. \n\nSach’s takeaways for other tech leaders: </p><ul><li><p>Don’t be afraid to rebuild when foundational capabilities change; Notion fully re-engineered its architecture to align with reasoning-based models.</p></li><li><p>Treat latency as contextual: Optimize per use case, rather than universally. </p></li><li><p>Ground all outputs in trustworthy, curated enterprise data to ensure accuracy and trust. \n\nShe advised: “Be willing to make the hard decisions. Be willing to sit at the top of the frontier, so to speak, on what you&#x27;re developing to build the best product you can for your customers.” </p></li></ul><p></p>]]></description>\n            <author>taryn.plumb@venturebeat.com (Taryn Plumb)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4UhFQT7cP4EsW10hrJr6Tj/c13730af61d302ca31c26f54c8253fca/Notion.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Here’s what Jony Ive and Sam Altman revealed about their secretive AI hardware project at OpenAI’s Dev Day]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/heres-what-jony-ive-and-sam-altman-revealed-about-their-secretive-ai</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">1YKwWfuOGMo8qJEUtmcu3z</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:40:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>In a packed theater at Fort Mason, after a whirlwind keynote of product announcements, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> CEO Sam Altman sat down with Sir Jony Ive, the legendary designer behind Apple&#x27;s most iconic products. The conversation, held exclusively for the 1,500 developers in attendance and not part of the public livestream, offered the clearest glimpse yet into the philosophy and ambition behind their secretive collaboration to build a new &quot;family&quot; of AI-powered devices.</p><p>The partnership, solidified by OpenAI&#x27;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/technology/openai-jony-ive-deal.html\"><u>staggering $6.5 billion acquisition</u></a> of Ive&#x27;s hardware startup Io in May, has been the subject of intense speculation.While concrete product details remained under wraps, the discussion pivoted away from specifications and toward a profound, almost therapeutic mission: to fix our broken relationship with technology.</p><p>For nearly 45 minutes, Ive, in his signature thoughtful cadence, articulated a vision that feels like both a continuation of and a repentance for his life&#x27;s work. The man who designed the iPhone, a device that arguably defined the modern era of personal computing, is now on a quest to cure the very anxieties it helped create.</p><h2>Jony Ive&#x27;s post-Apple mission, clarified by ChatGPT</h2><p>The collaboration, Ive explained, was years in the making, but it was the launch of ChatGPT that provided a sudden, clarifying purpose for his post-Apple design collective, <a href=\"https://www.lovefrom.com/\"><u>LoveFrom</u></a>.</p><p>&quot;With the launch of ChatGPT, it felt like our purpose for the last six years became clear,&quot; Ive said. &quot;We were starting to develop some ideas for an interface based on the capability of the technology these guys were developing... I&#x27;ve never in my career come across anything vaguely like the affordance, like the capability that we&#x27;re now starting to sense.&quot;</p><p>This capability, he argued, demands a fundamental rethinking of the devices we use, which he described as &quot;legacy products&quot; from a bygone era. The core motivation, he stressed, is not about corporate agendas but about a sense of duty to humanity.</p><p>&quot;The reason we&#x27;re doing this is we love our species and we want to be useful,&quot; Ive said. &quot;We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given.&quot;</p><h2>An &#x27;obscene understatement&#x27;: Jony Ive&#x27;s quest to cure our tech anxiety</h2><p>The most striking theme of the conversation was Ive&#x27;s candid critique of the current state of technology — the very ecosystem he was instrumental in building. He described our current dynamic with our devices as deeply flawed, a problem he now sees AI as the solution to, not an extension of.</p><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t think we have an easy relationship with our technology at the moment,&quot; Ive began, before adding, &quot;When I said we have an uncomfortable relationship with our technology, I mean, that&#x27;s the most obscene understatement.&quot;</p><p>Instead of chasing productivity, the primary goal for this new family of devices is emotional well-being. It&#x27;s a radical departure from the efficiency-obsessed ethos that dominates Silicon Valley.</p><p>When asked about his ambitions for the new devices, Ive prioritized emotional well-being over simple productivity. &quot;I know I should care about productivity, and I do,&quot; he said, but his ultimate goal is that the tools &quot;make us happy and fulfilled, and more peaceful and less anxious, and less disconnected.&quot;</p><p>He framed it as a chance to reject the current, fraught relationship people have with their technology. &quot;We have a chance to... absolutely change the situation that we find ourselves in,&quot; he stated. &quot;We don&#x27;t accept this has to be the norm.&quot;</p><h2>Buried in brilliance: why &#x27;15 to 20 compelling ideas&#x27; have become Ive&#x27;s biggest challenge</h2><p>While the vision is clear, the path is fraught with challenges. Reports have surfaced about <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58b078be-e0ab-492f-9dbf-c2fe67298dd3\"><u>technical hurdles and philosophical debates</u></a> delaying the project. Ive himself gave voice to this struggle, admitting the sheer pace of AI&#x27;s progress has been overwhelming. The rapid advancement has generated a torrent of possibilities, making the crucial act of focusing incredibly difficult.</p><p>&quot;The momentum is so extraordinary... it has led us to generate 15 to 20 really compelling product ideas. And the challenge is trying to focus,&quot; Ive confessed.&quot;I used to be good at that, and I&#x27;ve lost some confidence, because the choices are, it&#x27;ll be easy if you really knew there were three good ones... it&#x27;s just not like that.&quot;</p><p>This admission provides context to reports that the team is grappling with unresolved issues around the device&#x27;s &quot;personality&quot; and computing infrastructure. The goal, according to one source, is to create an AI companion that is &quot;accessible but not intrusive,&quot; avoiding the pitfalls of a &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58b078be-e0ab-492f-9dbf-c2fe67298dd3\"><u>weird AI girlfriend</u></a>.&quot;</p><h2>Beyond the screen: Ive&#x27;s design philosophy for an &#x27;inevitable&#x27; AI device</h2><p>While no devices were shown, the conversation and prior reports offer clues.

The results were described in a research paper published on open access website arxiv.org, entitled &quot;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04871v1\"><i>Less is More: Recursive Reasoning with Tiny Networks</i></a>.&quot;</p><p>&quot;The idea that one must rely on massive foundational models trained for millions of dollars by some big corporation in order to solve hard tasks is a trap,&quot; wrote Jolicoeur-Martineau on the <a href=\"https://x.com/jm_alexia/status/1975561300890812793\">social network X</a>. &quot;Currently, there is too much focus on exploiting LLMs rather than devising and expanding new lines of direction.&quot;</p><div></div><p>Jolicoeur-Martineau also added: &quot;With recursive reasoning, it turns out that &#x27;less is more&#x27;. <b>A tiny model pretrained from scratch, recursing on itself and updating its answers over time, can achieve a lot without breaking the bank.&quot;</b></p><p>TRM&#x27;s code is available now on <a href=\"https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels\">Github</a> under an enterprise-friendly, commercially viable MIT License — meaning anyone from researchers to companies can take, modify it, and deploy it for their own purposes, even commercial applications.</p><h3><b>One Big Caveat</b></h3><p>However, readers should be aware that TRM was designed specifically to perform well on structured, visual, grid-based problems like Sudoku, mazes, and puzzles on the <a href=\"https://arcprize.org/arc-agi\">ARC (Abstract and Reasoning Corpus)-AGI benchmark</a>, the latter which offers tasks that should be easy for humans but difficult for AI models, such sorting colors on a grid based on a prior, but not identical, solution. </p><h3><b>From Hierarchy to Simplicity</b></h3><p>The TRM architecture represents a radical simplification. </p><p>It builds upon a technique called <b>Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM)</b> introduced earlier this year, which showed that small networks could tackle logical puzzles like Sudoku and mazes. </p><p>HRM relied on two cooperating networks—one operating at high frequency, the other at low—supported by biologically inspired arguments and mathematical justifications involving fixed-point theorems. Jolicoeur-Martineau found this unnecessarily complicated.</p><p>TRM strips these elements away. Instead of two networks, it uses a <b>single two-layer model</b> that recursively refines its own predictions. </p><p>The model begins with an embedded question and an initial answer, represented by variables <b>x</b>, <b>y</b>, and <b>z</b>. Through a series of reasoning steps, it updates its internal latent representation <b>z</b> and refines the answer <b>y</b> until it converges on a stable output. Each iteration corrects potential errors from the previous step, yielding a self-improving reasoning process without extra hierarchy or mathematical overhead.</p><h3><b>How Recursion Replaces Scale</b></h3><p>The core idea behind TRM is that <i>recursion can substitute for depth and size.</i></p><p>By iteratively reasoning over its own output, the network effectively simulates a much deeper architecture without the associated memory or computational cost. This recursive cycle, run over as many as sixteen supervision steps, allows the model to make progressively better predictions — similar in spirit to how large language models use multi-step “chain-of-thought” reasoning, but achieved here with a compact, feed-forward design.</p><p>The simplicity pays off in both efficiency and generalization. The model uses fewer layers, no fixed-point approximations, and no dual-network hierarchy. A lightweight <b>halting mechanism</b> decides when to stop refining, preventing wasted computation while maintaining accuracy.</p><h3><b>Performance That Punches Above Its Weight</b></h3><p>Despite its small footprint, TRM delivers benchmark results that rival or exceed models millions of times larger. In testing, the model achieved:</p><ul><li><p><b>87.4% accuracy</b> on <b>Sudoku-Extreme</b> (up from 55% for HRM)</p></li><li><p><b>85% accuracy</b> on <b>Maze-Hard</b> puzzles</p></li><li><p><b>45% accuracy</b> on <b>ARC-AGI-1</b></p></li><li><p><b>8% accuracy</b> on <b>ARC-AGI-2</b></p></li></ul><p>These results surpass or closely match performance from several high-end large language models, including <b>DeepSeek R1</b>, <b>Gemini 2.5 Pro</b>, and <b>o3-mini</b>, despite TRM using less than 0.01% of their parameters.</p><p>Such results suggest that recursive reasoning, not scale, may be the key to handling abstract and combinatorial reasoning problems — domains where even top-tier generative models often stumble.</p><h3><b>Design Philosophy: Less Is More</b></h3><p>TRM’s success stems from deliberate minimalism. Jolicoeur-Martineau found that reducing complexity led to better generalization. </p><p>When the researcher increased layer count or model size, performance declined due to overfitting on small datasets. </p><p>By contrast, the two-layer structure, combined with recursive depth and <b>deep supervision</b>, achieved optimal results.</p><p>The model also performed better when self-attention was replaced with a <b>simpler multilayer perceptron</b> on tasks with small, fixed contexts like Sudoku. </p><p>For larger grids, such as ARC puzzles, self-attention remained valuable. These findings underline that model architecture should match data structure and scale rather than default to maximal capacity.</p><h3><b>Training Small, Thinking Big</b></h3><p>TRM is now officially available as <b>open source under an MIT license</b> on <a href=\"https://github.com/SamsungSAILMontreal/TinyRecursiveModels\">GitHub</a>.</p><p>The repository includes full training and evaluation scripts, dataset builders for Sudoku, Maze, and ARC-AGI, and reference configurations for reproducing the published results. </p><p>It also documents compute requirements ranging from a single NVIDIA L40S GPU for Sudoku training to multi-GPU H100 setups for ARC-AGI experiments.</p><p>The open release confirms that TRM is designed specifically for <b>structured, grid-based reasoning tasks</b> rather than general-purpose language modeling. </p><p>Each benchmark — Sudoku-Extreme, Maze-Hard, and ARC-AGI — uses small, well-defined input–output grids, aligning with the model’s recursive supervision process. </p><p>Training involves substantial data augmentation (such as color permutations and geometric transformations), underscoring that TRM’s efficiency lies in its parameter size rather than total compute demand.</p><p>The model’s simplicity and transparency make it more accessible to researchers outside of large corporate labs. Its codebase builds directly on the earlier Hierarchical Reasoning Model framework but removes HRM’s biological analogies, multiple network hierarchies, and fixed-point dependencies. </p><p>In doing so, TRM offers a reproducible baseline for exploring recursive reasoning in small models — a counterpoint to the dominant “scale is all you need” philosophy.</p><h3><b>Community Reaction</b></h3><p>The release of TRM and its open-source codebase prompted an immediate debate among AI researchers and practitioners on X. While many praised the achievement, others questioned how broadly its methods could generalize.</p><p>Supporters hailed TRM as proof that small models can outperform giants, calling it “<a href=\"https://x.com/VraserX/status/1975668454763209169\">10,000× smaller yet smarter</a>” and a potential step toward architectures that think rather than merely scale. </p><p>Critics countered that TRM’s domain is narrow — focused on <b>bounded, grid-based puzzles</b> — and that its compute savings come mainly from size, not total runtime. </p><p>Researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/ynmncha/status/1975699469607010731\">Yunmin Cha</a> noted that TRM’s training depends on heavy augmentation and recursive passes, “more compute, same model.” </p><p>Cancer geneticist and data scientist<a href=\"https://x.com/LovedayChey/status/1975907723150590019\"> Chey Loveday</a> stressed that TRM is a <i>solver</i>, not a chat model or text generator: it excels at structured reasoning but not open-ended language.</p><p>Machine learning researcher <a href=\"https://x.com/rasbt/status/1975922614389408022\">Sebastian Raschka</a> positioned TRM as an important simplification of HRM rather than a new form of general intelligence. </p><p>He described its process as “a two-step loop that updates an internal reasoning state, then refines the answer.”</p><p>Several researchers, including <a href=\"https://x.com/augustinabele/status/1975927654353445022\">Augustin Nabele</a>, agreed that the model’s strength lies in its clear reasoning structure but noted that future work would need to show transfer to less-constrained problem types.</p><p>The consensus emerging online is that TRM may be narrow, but its message is broad: careful recursion, not constant expansion, could drive the next wave of reasoning research.</p><h3><b>Looking Ahead</b></h3><p>While TRM currently applies to supervised reasoning tasks, its recursive framework opens several future directions. Jolicoeur-Martineau has suggested exploring <b>generative or multi-answer variants</b>, where the model could produce multiple possible solutions rather than a single deterministic one. </p><p>Another open question involves scaling laws for recursion — determining how far the “less is more” principle can extend as model complexity or data size grows.</p><p>Ultimately, the study offers both a practical tool and a conceptual reminder: progress in AI need not depend on ever-larger models. Sometimes, teaching a small network to think carefully — and recursively — can be more powerful than making a large one think once.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4Y3jccClBvI8kQZ6vIONvV/6e12602d0648cdc7e769b10d531f649e/cfr0z3n_watercolor_evocative_storybook_artwork_of_a_giant_robot_3432736a-32c4-46e0-af0f-9e87b1fd4208.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[AI21’s Jamba reasoning 3B redefines what 'small' means in LLMs — 250K context on a laptop]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai21s-jamba-reasoning-3b-redefines-what-small-means-in-llms-250k-context-on</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">oQCPe46scDHsh38EtDgIh</guid>\n            <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>The latest addition to the small model wave for enterprises comes from <a href=\"https://www.ai21.com/\"><u>AI21 Labs</u></a>, which is betting that bringing models to devices will free up traffic in data centers. </p><p>AI21’s Jamba Reasoning 3B, a “tiny” open-source model that can run extended reasoning, code generation and respond based on ground truth. Jamba Reasoning 3B handles more than 250,000 tokens and can run inference on edge devices. </p><p>The company said Jamba Reasoning 3B works on devices such as laptops and mobile phones. </p><p>Ori Goshen, co-CEO of AI21, told VentureBeat that the company sees more enterprise use cases for small models, mainly because moving most inference to devices frees up data centers.  </p><p>“What we&#x27;re seeing right now in the industry is an economics issue where there are very expensive data center build-outs, and the revenue that is generated from the data centers versus the depreciation rate of all their chips shows the math doesn&#x27;t add up,” Goshen said. </p><p>He added that in the future “the industry by and large would be hybrid in the sense that some of the computation will be on devices locally and other inference will move to GPUs.”</p><h2>Tested on a MacBook</h2><p>\nJamba Reasoning 3B combines the Mamba architecture and Transformers to allow it to run a 250K token window on devices. AI21 said it can do 2-4x faster inference speeds. Goshen said the Mamba architecture significantly contributed to the model’s speed. </p><p>Jamba Reasoning 3B’s hybrid architecture also allows it to reduce memory requirements, thereby reducing its computing needs. </p><p>AI21 tested the model on a standard MacBook Pro and found that it can process 35 tokens per second. </p><p>Goshen said the model works best for tasks involving function calling, policy-grounded generation and tool routing. He said that simple requests, such as asking for information about a forthcoming meeting and asking the model to create an agenda for it, could be done on devices. The more complex reasoning tasks can be saved for GPU clusters. </p><h2>Small models in enterprise</h2><p>Enterprises have been interested in using a mix of small models, some of which are specifically designed for their industry and some that are condensed versions of LLMs. </p><p>In September, <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\"><u>Meta</u></a> released <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/metas-new-small-reasoning-model-shows-industry-shift-toward-tiny-ai-for\"><u>MobileLLM-R1, a family of reasoning models</u></a> ranging from 140M to 950M parameters. These models are designed for math, coding and scientific reasoning rather than chat applications. MobileLLM-R1 can run on compute-constrained devices. </p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/\"><u>Google</u></a>’s <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-open-source-gemma-3-model-with-128k-context-window\"><u>Gemma</u></a> was one of the first small models to come to the market, designed to run on portable devices like laptops and mobile phones. Gemma has since <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-unveils-ultra-small-and-efficient-open-source-ai-model-gemma-3-270m-that-can-run-on-smartphones\"><u>been expanded</u></a>. </p><p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.myfico.com/\"><u>FICO</u></a> have also begun building their own models. <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ficos-answer-to-ai-risk-a-foundation-model-that-scores-every-output-for\"><u>FICO launched</u></a> its FICO Focused Language and FICO Focused Sequence small models that will only answer finance-specific questions. </p><p>Goshen said the big difference their model offers is that it’s even smaller than most models and yet it can run reasoning tasks without sacrificing speed. </p><h2>Benchmark testing </h2><p>In benchmark testing, Jamba Reasoning 3B demonstrated strong performance compared to other small models, including <a href=\"https://chat.qwen.ai/\"><u>Qwen</u></a> 4B, <a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\"><u>Meta</u></a>’s Llama 3.2B-3B, and Phi-4-Mini from <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/\"><u>Microsoft</u></a>. </p><p>It outperformed all models on the IFBench test and Humanity’s Last Exam, although it came in second to Qwen 4 on MMLU-Pro. </p><p>Goshen said another advantage of small models like Jamba Reasoning 3B is that they are highly steerable and provide better privacy options to enterprises because the inference is not sent to a server elsewhere. </p><p>“I do believe there’s a world where you can optimize for the needs and the experience of the customer, and the models that will be kept on devices are a large part of it,” he said. </p><p>\n\n\n\n\n</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5oeaGc6bdeKn9zv5ZBduGS/f5fd953849eaf0b642bec868df68b07e/crimedy7_illustration_of_dozens_of_small_robots_working_on_a__4b54aeff-0eaf-4af3-abfa-c8fe2d943247_2.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[OpenAI Dev Day 2025: ChatGPT becomes the new app store — and hardware is coming]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-dev-day-2025-chatgpt-becomes-the-new-app-store-and-hardware-is-coming</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">6na0pAdxl9xh4fN39O1ww5</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:30:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>In a packed hall at Fort Mason Center in San Francisco, against a backdrop of the Golden Gate Bridge, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\"><u>OpenAI</u></a> CEO Sam Altman laid out a bold vision to remake the digital world. The company that brought generative AI to the mainstream with a simple chatbot is now building the foundations for its next act: a comprehensive computing platform designed to move beyond the screen and browser, with legendary designer Jony Ive enlisted to help shape its physical form.</p><p>At its <a href=\"https://openai.com/devday/\"><u>third annual DevDay</u></a>, OpenAI unveiled a suite of tools that signals a strategic pivot from a model provider to a full-fledged ecosystem. The message was clear: the era of simply asking an AI questions is over. The future is about commanding AI to perform complex tasks, build software autonomously, and live inside every application, a transition Altman framed as moving from &quot;systems that you can ask anything to, to systems that you can ask to do anything for you.&quot; </p><p>The day’s announcements were a three-pronged assault on the status quo, targeting how users interact with software, how developers build it, and how businesses deploy intelligent agents. But it was the sessions held behind closed doors, away from the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/hS1YqcewH0c?si=mFE2rRx3QrK7z6NF\"><u>public livestream</u></a>, that revealed the true scope of OpenAI’s ambition — a future that includes new hardware, a relentless pursuit of computational power, and a philosophical quest to redefine our relationship with technology.</p><h3><b>From chatbot to operating system: The new &#x27;App Store&#x27;</b></h3><p>The centerpiece of the public-facing keynote was the transformation of <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a> itself. With the new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-apps-in-chatgpt/\"><u>Apps SDK</u></a>, OpenAI is turning its wildly popular chatbot into a dynamic, interactive platform, effectively an operating system where developers can build and distribute their own applications.</p><p>“Today, we&#x27;re going to open up ChatGPT for developers to build real apps inside of ChatGPT,” Altman announced during the keynote presentation to applause. “This will enable a new generation of apps that are interactive, adaptive and personalized, that you can chat with.”</p><p>Live demonstrations showcased apps from partners like <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\"><u>Coursera</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\"><u>Canva</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/\"><u>Zillow</u></a> running seamlessly within a chat conversation. A user could watch a machine learning lecture, ask <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a> to explain a concept in real-time, and then use Canva to generate a poster based on the conversation, all without leaving the chat interface. The apps can render rich, interactive UIs, even going full-screen to offer a complete experience, like exploring a Zillow map of homes.</p><p>For developers, this represents a powerful new distribution channel. “When you build with the Apps SDK, your apps can reach hundreds of millions of chat users,” Altman said, highlighting a direct path to a massive user base that has grown to over <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-announces-apps-sdk-allowing-chatgpt-to-launch-and-run-third-party\"><u>800 million weekly active users</u></a>. </p><p>In a private press conference later, Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT, elaborated on the grander vision. &quot;We never meant to build a chatbot,&quot; he stated. &quot;When we set out to make ChatGPT, we meant to build a super assistant and we got a little sidetracked. And one of the tragedies of getting a little sidetracked is that we built a great chatbot, but we are the first ones to say that not all software needs to be a chatbot, not all interaction with the commercial world needs to be a chatbot.&quot;</p><p>Turley emphasized that while OpenAI is excited about natural language interfaces, &quot;the interface really needs to evolve, which is why you see so much UI in the demos today. In fact, you can even go full screen and chat is in the background.&quot; He described a future where users might &quot;start your day in ChatGPT, just because it kind of has become the de facto entry point into the commercial web and into a lot of software,&quot; but clarified that &quot;our incentive is not to keep you in. Our product is to allow other people to build amazing businesses on top and to evolve the form factor of software.&quot;</p><h3><b>The rise of the agents: Building the &#x27;do anything&#x27; AI</b></h3><p>If apps are about bringing the world into ChatGPT, the new &quot;<a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/\"><u>Agent Kit</u></a>&quot; is about sending AI out into the world to get things done. OpenAI is providing a complete &quot;set of building blocks... to help you take agents from prototype to production,&quot; Altman explained in his keynote. </p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-agentkit/\"><u>Agent Kit</u></a> is an integrated development environment for creating autonomous AI workers. It features a visual canvas to design complex workflows, an embeddable chat interface (&quot;Chat Kit&quot;) for deploying agents in any app, and a sophisticated evaluation suite to measure and improve performance.</p><p>A compelling demo from financial operations platform <a href=\"https://ramp.com/\"><u>Ramp</u></a> showed how Agent Kit was used to build a procurement agent. An employee could simply type, &quot;I need five more ChatGPT business seats,&quot; and the agent would parse the request, check it against company expense policies, find vendor details, and prepare a virtual credit card for the purchase — a process that once took weeks now completed in minutes. </p><p>This push into agents is a direct response to a growing enterprise need to move beyond AI as a simple information retrieval tool and toward AI as a productivity engine that automates complex business processes. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI&#x27;s COO, noted that for enterprise adoption, &quot;you needed this kind of shift to more agentic AI that could actually do things for you, versus just respond with text outputs.&quot; </p><h3><b>The future of code and the Jony Ive bBombshell</b></h3><p>Perhaps the most profound shift is occurring in software development itself. <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/codex-now-generally-available/\"><u>Codex</u></a>, OpenAI&#x27;s AI coding agent, has graduated from a research preview to a full-fledged product, now powered by a specialized version of the new GPT-5 model. It is, as one speaker put it, &quot;a teammate that understands your context.&quot; </p><p>The capabilities are staggering. Developers can now assign <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/codex-now-generally-available/\"><u>Codex</u></a> tasks directly from <a href=\"https://slack.com/\"><u>Slack</u></a>, and the agent can autonomously write code, create pull requests, and even review other engineers&#x27; work on <a href=\"https://github.com/\"><u>GitHub</u></a>. A live demo showed Codex taking a simple photo of a whiteboard sketch and turning it into a fully functional, beautifully designed mobile app screen. Another demo showed an app that could &quot;self-evolve,&quot; reprogramming itself in real-time based on a user&#x27;s natural language request. </p><p>But the day&#x27;s biggest surprise came in a closing fireside chat, which was not livestreamed, between <a href=\"https://openai.com/sam-and-jony/\"><u>Altman and Jony Ive</u></a>, the iconic former chief design officer of Apple. The two revealed they have been collaborating for three years on a new family of AI-centric hardware.</p><p>Ive, whose design philosophy shaped the iPhone, iMac, and Apple Watch, said his creative team’s purpose &quot;became clear&quot; with the launch of ChatGPT. He argued that our current relationship with technology is broken and that AI presents an opportunity for a fundamental reset.</p><p>“I think it would be absurd to assume that you could have technology that is this breathtaking, delivered to us through legacy products, products that are decades old,” Ive said. “I see it as a chance to use this most remarkable capability to full-on address a lot of the overwhelm and despair that people feel right now.”</p><p>While details of the devices remain secret, Ive spoke of his motivation in deeply human terms. “We love our species, and we want to be useful. We think that humanity deserves much better than humanity generally is given,” he said. He emphasized the importance of &quot;care&quot; in the design process, stating, &quot;We sense when people have cared... you sense carelessness. You sense when somebody does not care about you, they care about money and schedule.&quot; </p><p>This collaboration confirms that OpenAI&#x27;s ambitions are not confined to the cloud; it is actively exploring the physical interface through which humanity will interact with its powerful new intelligence.</p><h3><b>The Unquenchable Thirst for Compute</b></h3><p>Underpinning this entire platform strategy is a single, overwhelming constraint: the availability of computing power. In both the private press conference and the un-streamed Developer State of the Union, OpenAI’s leadership returned to this theme again and again.</p><p>“The degree to which we are all constrained by compute... Everyone is just so constrained on being able to offer the services at the scale required to get the revenue that at this point, we&#x27;re quite confident we can push it pretty far,” Altman told reporters. He added that even with massive new hardware partnerships with AMD and others, &quot;we&#x27;ll be saying the same thing again. We&#x27;re so convinced... There&#x27;s so much more demand.&quot; </p><p>This explains the company’s aggressive, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/companies-pouring-billions-advance-ai-infrastructure-2025-10-06/\"><u>multi-billion-dollar investment in infrastructure</u></a>. When asked about profitability, Altman was candid that the company is in a phase of &quot;investment and growth.&quot; He invoked a famous quote from Walt Disney, paraphrasing, &quot;We make more money so we can make more movies.&quot; For OpenAI, the &quot;movies&quot; are ever-more-powerful AI models.</p><p>Greg Brockman, OpenAI’s President, put the ultimate goal in stark economic terms during the Developer State of the Union. &quot;AI is going to become, probably in the not too distant future, the fundamental driver of economic growth,&quot; he said. &quot;Asking ‘How much compute do you want?’ is a little bit like asking how much workforce do you want? The answer is, you can always get more out of more.&quot; </p><p>As the day concluded and developers mingled at the reception, the scale of OpenAI&#x27;s project came into focus. Fueled by new models like the powerful <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-pro\"><u>GPT-5 Pro</u></a> and the stunning <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/sora-2/\"><u>Sora 2</u></a> video generator, the company is no longer just building AI. It is building the world where AI will live — a world of intelligent apps, autonomous agents, and new physical devices, betting that in the near future, intelligence itself will be the ultimate platform.</p><p>\n</p>]]></description>\n            <author>michael.nunez@venturebeat.com (Michael Nuñez)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <category>Programming &amp; Development</category>\n            <category>Dev</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5SsXpDqbiyZvm7DJbht3pv/765b6ae01f75c4e84f15e6f9f026bdf2/nuneybits_A_developer_working_on_a_retro_computer_on_gradient_b_a06360d7-aa20-4d82-949f-48730f690988.webp\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/webp\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Google's AI can now surf the web for you, click on buttons, and fill out forms with Gemini 2.5 Computer Use]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/googles-ai-can-now-surf-the-web-for-you-click-on-buttons-and-fill-out-forms</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">16FWPi5oxebzZiw3Q7EeGN</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 22:20:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>Some of the largest providers of large language models (LLMs) have sought to move beyond multimodal chatbots — extending their models out into &quot;agents&quot; that can actually take more actions on behalf of the user across websites. Recall <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-unveils-chatgpt-agent-that-gives-chatgpt-its-own-computer-to-autonomously-use-your-email-and-web-apps-download-and-create-files-for-you\">OpenAI&#x27;s ChatGPT Agent </a>(formerly known as &quot;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-openais-operator-an-ai-agent-that-uses-the-web-to-book-you-dinner-reservations-order-tickets-compile-grocery-lists-and-more\">Operator</a>&quot;) and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropic-new-ai-can-use-computers-like-a-human-redefining-automation-for-enterprises\">Anthropic&#x27;s Computer Use</a>, both released over the last two years. </p><p>Now, Google is getting into that same game as well. Today, the search giant&#x27;s<b> DeepMind AI lab subsidiary unveiled a new, fine-tuned and custom-trained version of its powerful Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM</b> known as &quot;<a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=\">Gemini 2.5 Pro Computer Use</a>,&quot; which can<b> use a virtual browser to surf the web on your behalf, retrieve information, fill out forms, and even take actions on websites</b> — all from a user&#x27;s single text prompt.</p><p>&quot;These are early days, but the model’s ability to interact with the web – like scrolling, filling forms + navigating dropdowns – is an <b>important next step in building general-purpose agents,&quot; </b>said <b>Google CEO Sundar Pichai,</b> as part of a <a href=\"https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1975668337364590913\">longer statement on the social network, X.</a></p><div></div><p>The model is not available for consumers directly from Google, though.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"https://x.com/browserbasehq/status/1975649022112374913\">Google partnered </a>with another company, <a href=\"https://www.browserbase.com/\">Browserbase</a>, founded by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/T8D9jfNEs9M?si=uaz2eHbvFByP0HBu\">former Twilio engineer Paul Klein in early 2024</a>, which offers virtual &quot;headless&quot; web browser specifically for use by AI agents and applications. (A &quot;headless&quot; browser is one that doesn&#x27;t require a graphical user interface, or GUI, to navigate the web, though in this case and others, Browserbase does show a graphical representation for the user). </p><p>Users can demo the new Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model directly on Browserbase <a href=\"https://gemini.browserbase.com/\">here</a> and even compare it side-by-side with the older, rival offerings from OpenAI and Anthropic in a new &quot;<a href=\"https://arena.browserbase.com/\">Browser Arena</a>&quot; launched by the startup (though only one additional model can be selected alongside Gemini at a time).</p><p>For AI builders and developers, it&#x27;s being made as a raw, albeit propreitary LLM <!-- -->through the <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use\"><b>Gemini API in Google AI Studio</b></a> for <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/ai/gemini?hl=en\">rapid prototyping</a>, and Google Cloud&#x27;s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/computer-use\"><b>Vertex AI</b></a> model selector and applications building platform. </p><p>The new offering builds on the capabilities of<b> Gemini 2.5 Pro</b>, <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/google-releases-most-intelligent-model-to-date-gemini-2-5-pro\">released back in March 2025</a> but which has been updated significantly several times since then, with a specific focus on enabling AI agents to perform direct interactions with user interfaces, including browsers and mobile applications.</p><p>Overall, it appears <!-- -->Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is designed to let developers create agents that can complete interface-driven tasks autonomously — such as clicking, typing, scrolling, filling out forms, and navigating behind login screens. </p><p>Rather than relying solely on APIs or structured inputs, this model allows AI systems to interact with software visually and functionally, much like a human would.</p><h3><b>Brief User Hands-On Tests</b></h3><p>In my brief, unscientific initial hands-on tests on the Browserbase website, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully navigate to Taylor Swift&#x27;s official website as instructed and provided me a summary of what was being sold or promoted at the top — a special edition of her newest album, &quot;The Life of A Showgirl.&quot;</p><p>In another test, I asked Gemini 2.5 Computer Use to search Amazon for highly rated and well-reviewed solar lights I could stake into my back yard, and I was delighted to watch as it successfully completed a Google Search Captcha designed to weed out non-human users (&quot;Select all the boxes with a motorcycle.&quot;) It did so in a matter of seconds.</p><p>However, once it got through there, it stalled and was unable to complete the task, despite serving up a &quot;task competed&quot; message. </p><p>I should also note here that while the <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-unveils-chatgpt-agent-that-gives-chatgpt-its-own-computer-to-autonomously-use-your-email-and-web-apps-download-and-create-files-for-you\">ChatGPT agent from OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/claude-deepens-its-enterprise-push-with-document-generation-taking-the-ai\">Anthropic&#x27;s Claude</a> can create and edit local files — such as PowerPoint presentations, spreadsheets, or text documents — on the user’s behalf, Gemini 2.5 Computer Use does not currently offer direct file system access or native file creation capabilities. </p><p>Instead, it is designed to control and navigate web and mobile user interfaces through actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling. Its output is limited to suggested UI actions or chatbot-style text responses; any structured output like a document or file must be handled separately by the developer, often through custom code or third-party integrations.</p><h3><b>Performance Benchmarks</b></h3><p>Google says Gemini 2.5 Computer Use  has demonstrated leading results in multiple interface control benchmarks, particularly when compared to other major AI systems including Claude Sonnet and OpenAI’s agent-based models. </p><p>Evaluations were conducted via Browserbase and Google’s own testing.</p><p>Some highlights include:</p><ul><li><p><b>Online-Mind2Web (Browserbase):</b> 65.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 61.0% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 44.3% (OpenAI Agent)</p></li><li><p><b>WebVoyager (Browserbase):</b> 79.9% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 69.4% (Claude Sonnet 4) and 61.0% (OpenAI Agent)</p></li><li><p><b>AndroidWorld (DeepMind):</b> 69.7% for Gemini 2.5 vs. 62.1% (Claude Sonnet 4); OpenAI&#x27;s model could not be measured due to lack of access</p></li><li><p><b>OSWorld:</b> Currently not supported by Gemini 2.5; top competitor result was 61.4%</p></li></ul><p>In addition to strong accuracy, Google reports that the model operates at lower latency than other browser control solutions — a key factor in production use cases like UI automation and testing.</p><h3><b>How It Works</b></h3><p>Agents powered by the Computer Use model operate within an interaction loop. They receive:</p><ul><li><p>A user task prompt</p></li><li><p>A screenshot of the interface</p></li><li><p>A history of past actions</p></li></ul><p>The model analyzes this input and produces a recommended UI action, such as clicking a button or typing into a field. </p><p>If needed, it can request confirmation from the end user for riskier tasks, such as making a purchase.</p><p>Once the action is executed, the interface state is updated and a new screenshot is sent back to the model. The loop continues until the task is completed or halted due to an error or a safety decision.</p><p>The model uses a specialized tool called <code>computer_use</code>, and it can be integrated into custom environments using tools like <b>Playwright</b> or via the <b>Browserbase</b> demo sandbox.</p><h3><b>Use Cases and Adoption</b></h3><p>According to Google, teams internally and externally have already started using the model across several domains:</p><ul><li><p><b>Google’s payments platform team</b> reports that Gemini 2.5 Computer Use successfully recovers over 60% of failed test executions, reducing a major source of engineering inefficiencies.</p></li><li><p><b>Autotab</b>, a third-party AI agent platform, said the model outperformed others on complex data parsing tasks, boosting performance by up to 18% in their hardest evaluations.</p></li><li><p><b>Poke.com</b>, a proactive AI assistant provider, noted that the Gemini model often operates <b>50% faster</b> than competing solutions during interface interactions.</p></li></ul><p>The model is also being used in Google’s own product development efforts, including in <b>Project Mariner</b>, the <b>Firebase Testing Agent</b>, and <b>AI Mode in Search</b>.</p><h3><b>Safety Measures</b></h3><p>Because this model directly controls software interfaces, Google emphasizes a multi-layered approach to safety:</p><ul><li><p>A <b>per-step safety service</b> inspects every proposed action before execution.</p></li><li><p>Developers can define <b>system-level instructions</b> to block or require confirmation for specific actions.</p></li><li><p>The model includes built-in safeguards to avoid actions that might compromise security or violate Google’s prohibited use policies.</p></li></ul><p>For example, if the model encounters a CAPTCHA, it will generate an action to click the checkbox but flag it as requiring user confirmation, ensuring the system does not proceed without human oversight.</p><h3><b>Technical Capabilities</b></h3><p>The model supports a wide array of built-in UI actions such as:</p><ul><li><p><code>click_at</code>, <code>type_text_at</code>, <code>scroll_document</code>, <code>drag_and_drop</code>, and more</p></li><li><p>User-defined functions can be added to extend its reach to mobile or custom environments</p></li><li><p>Screen coordinates are normalized (0–1000 scale) and translated back to pixel dimensions during execution</p></li></ul><p>It accepts <b>image and text</b> input and outputs <b>text responses</b> or <b>function calls</b> to perform tasks. The recommended screen resolution for optimal results is <b>1440x900</b>, though it can work with other sizes.</p><h3><b>API Pricing Remains Almost Identical to Gemini 2.5 Pro</b></h3><p>The pricing for <b>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use</b> aligns closely with the standard Gemini 2.5 Pro model. Both follow the same per-token billing structure: input tokens are priced at <b>$1.25 per one million tokens</b> for prompts under 200,000 tokens, and <b>$2.50 per million tokens</b> for prompts longer than that. </p><p>Output tokens follow a similar split, priced at <b>$10.00 per million</b> for smaller responses and <b>$15.00</b> for larger ones.</p><p>Where the models diverge is in availability and additional features. </p><p><b>Gemini 2.5 Pro includes a free tier </b>that allows developers to use the model at no cost, with no explicit token cap published, though usage may be subject to rate limits or quota constraints depending on the platform (e.g. Google AI Studio). </p><p>This free access includes both input and output tokens. Once developers exceed their allotted quota or switch to the paid tier, standard per-token pricing applies.</p><p>In contrast, <b>Gemini 2.5 Computer Use is available exclusively through the paid tier.</b> There is <b>no free access</b> currently offered for this model, and all usage incurs token-based charges from the outset.</p><p>Feature-wise, Gemini 2.5 Pro supports optional capabilities like context caching (starting at $0.31 per million tokens) and grounding with Google Search (free for up to 1,500 requests per day, then $35 per 1,000 additional requests). These are not available for Computer Use at this time.</p><p>Another distinction is in data handling: output from the Computer Use model is not used to improve Google products in the paid tier, while free-tier usage of Gemini 2.5 Pro contributes to model improvement unless explicitly opted out.</p><p>Overall, developers can expect similar token-based costs across both models, but they should consider tier access, included capabilities, and data use policies when deciding which model fits their needs.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/5s9EWAUfhOBtT7gJSTJBtI/2fd316df548ef4c0fb40f47c53118ace/cfr0z3n_ultra_minimalist_clean_line_bold_simple_shapes_Google_c_628f064a-d4fe-4c36-9014-3c31c5160b0f__1_.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[Has this stealth startup finally cracked the code on enterprise AI agent reliability?

Yet even as large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude learn to reason, explain, and code, one critical category of interaction remains largely unsolved — reliably completing tasks for people <i>outside of chat</i>. </p><p>Even the<b> best AI models score only in the </b><a href=\"https://artificialanalysis.ai/evaluations/terminalbench-hard\"><b>30th percentile on Terminal-Bench Hard,</b></a> a third-party benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of AI agents on completing a variety of browser-based tasks, far below the reliability demanded by most enterprises and users. And task-specific benchmarks <a href=\"https://hal.cs.princeton.edu/taubench_airline\">like TAU-Bench airline,</a> which measures the <b>reliability of AI agents on finding and booking flights</b> on behalf of a user, also don&#x27;t have much higher pass rates, with <b>only 56% for the top performing agents and models</b> (Claude 3.7 Sonnet) — meaning the agent fails nearly half the time. </p><p>New York City-based <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/\"><b>Augmented Intelligence (AUI) Inc.</b></a>, co-founded by <b>Ohad Elhelo</b> and <b>Ori Cohen</b>, believes it has finally come with a solution to boost AI agent reliability to a level where most enterprises can trust they will do as instructed, reliably. </p><p>The company’s new foundation model, called <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/resources/beyond-generative-ai/\"><b>Apollo-1</b></a><b> </b>— which remains in preview with early testers now but is close to an impending general release — is built on a principle it calls <i>stateful neuro-symbolic reasoning.</i></p><p>It&#x27;s a hybrid architecture championed by even <a href=\"https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/how-o3-and-grok-4-accidentally-vindicated\">LLM skeptics like Gary Marcus</a>, designed to guarantee consistent, policy-compliant outcomes in every customer interaction.</p><p>“Conversational AI is essentially two halves,” said Elhelo in a recent interview with VentureBeat. “The first half — open-ended dialogue — is handled beautifully by LLMs. They’re designed for creative or exploratory use cases. The other half is task-oriented dialogue, where there’s always a specific goal behind the conversation. That half has remained unsolved because it requires certainty.”</p><p>AUI defines <i>certainty</i> as the difference between an agent that “probably” performs a task and one that almost “always” does. </p><p>For example, on <b>TAU-Bench Airline, it performs at a staggering 92.5% pass rate</b>, leaving all the other current competitors far behind in the dust — according to benchmarks shared with VentureBeat and <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/resources/beyond-generative-ai/\">posted on AUI&#x27;s website.</a></p><p>Elhelo offered simple examples: a bank that must enforce ID verification for refunds over $200, or an airline that must always offer a business-class upgrade before economy. </p><p>“Those aren’t preferences,” he said. “They’re requirements. And no purely generative approach can deliver that kind of behavioral certainty.”</p><p>AUI and its work on improving reliability was previously covered by subscription news outlet <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/startup-teaching-ai-agents-shop\"><i>The Information</i></a>, but has not received widespread coverage in publicly accessible media — until now. </p><h3><b>From Pattern Matching to Predictable Action</b></h3><p>The team argues that transformer models, by design, can’t meet that bar. Large language models generate plausible text, not guaranteed behavior. “When you tell an LLM to always offer insurance before payment, it might — usually,” Elhelo said. “Configure Apollo-1 with that rule, and it will — every time.”</p><p>That distinction, he said, stems from the architecture itself. Transformers predict the next token in a sequence. Apollo-1, by contrast, predicts the <i>next action</i> in a conversation, operating on what AUI calls a <i>typed symbolic state</i>.</p><p>Cohen explained the idea in more technical terms. “Neuro-symbolic means we’re merging the two dominant paradigms,” he said. “The symbolic layer gives you structure — it knows what an intent, an entity, and a parameter are — while the neural layer gives you language fluency. The neuro-symbolic reasoner sits between them. It’s a different kind of brain for dialogue.”</p><p>Where transformers treat every output as text generation, Apollo-1 runs a closed reasoning loop: an encoder translates natural language into a symbolic state, a state machine maintains that state, a decision engine determines the next action, a planner executes it, and a decoder turns the result back into language. “The process is iterative,” Cohen said. “It loops until the task is done. That’s how you get determinism instead of probability.”</p><h3><b>A Foundation Model for Task Execution</b></h3><p>Unlike traditional chatbots or bespoke automation systems, Apollo-1 is meant to serve as a <i>foundation model</i> for task-oriented dialogue — a single, domain-agnostic system that can be configured for banking, travel, retail, or insurance through what AUI calls a <b>System Prompt</b>.</p><p>“The System Prompt isn’t a configuration file,” Elhelo said. “It’s a behavioral contract. You define exactly how your agent must behave in situations of interest, and Apollo-1 guarantees those behaviors will execute.”</p><p>Organizations can use the prompt to encode symbolic slots — intents, parameters, and policies — as well as tool boundaries and state-dependent rules. </p><p>A food delivery app, for example, might enforce “if allergy mentioned, always inform the restaurant,” while a telecom provider might define “after three failed payment attempts, suspend service.” In both cases, the behavior executes deterministically, not statistically.</p><h3><b>Eight Years in the Making</b></h3><p>AUI’s path to Apollo-1 began in 2017, when the team started encoding millions of real task-oriented conversations handled by a 60,000-person human agent workforce. </p><p>That work led to a symbolic language capable of separating <i>procedural knowledge</i> — steps, constraints, and flows — from <i>descriptive knowledge</i> like entities and attributes.</p><p>“The insight was that task-oriented dialogue has universal procedural patterns,” said Elhelo. “Food delivery, claims processing, and order management all share similar structures. Once you model that explicitly, you can compute over it deterministically.”</p><p>From there, the company built the neuro-symbolic reasoner — a system that uses the symbolic state to decide what happens next rather than guessing through token prediction.</p><p>Benchmarks suggest the architecture makes a measurable difference. </p><p>In AUI’s own evaluations, Apollo-1 achieved over <b>90 percent</b> task completion on the τ-Bench-Airline benchmark, compared with <b>60 percent</b> for Claude-4. </p><p>It completed <b>83 percent</b> of live booking chats on Google Flights versus <b>22 percent</b> for Gemini 2.5-Flash, and <b>91 percent</b> of retail scenarios on Amazon versus <b>17 percent</b> for Rufus.</p><p>“These aren’t incremental improvements,” said Cohen. “They’re order-of-magnitude reliability differences.”</p><h3><b>A Complement, Not a Competitor</b></h3><p>AUI isn’t pitching Apollo-1 as a replacement for large language models, but as their necessary counterpart. In Elhelo’s words: “Transformers optimize for creative probability. Apollo-1 optimizes for behavioral certainty. Together, they form the complete spectrum of conversational AI.”</p><p>The model is already running in limited pilots with undisclosed Fortune 500 companies across sectors including finance, travel, and retail. </p><p>AUI has also confirmed a <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/partners/google-cloud-partners-with-aui/\"><b>strategic partnership with Google</b></a> and plans for <b>general availability in November 2025</b>, when it will open APIs, release full documentation, and add voice and image capabilities. Interested potential customers and partners can sign up to receive more information when it <a href=\"https://www.aui.io/request-access/\">becomes available on AUI&#x27;s website form.</a></p><p>Until then, the company is keeping details under wraps. When asked about what comes next, Elhelo smiled. “Let’s just say we’re preparing an announcement,” he said. “Soon.”</p><h3><b>Toward Conversations That Act</b></h3><p>For all its technical sophistication, Apollo-1’s pitch is simple: make AI that businesses can trust to act — not just talk. “We’re on a mission to democratize access to AI that works,” Cohen said near the end of the interview.</p><p>Whether Apollo-1 becomes the new standard for task-oriented dialogue remains to be seen. But if AUI’s architecture performs as promised, the long-standing divide between chatbots that sound human and agents that reliably do human work may finally start to close.</p>]]></description>\n            <author>carlfranzen@gmail.com (Carl Franzen)</author>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/4P5b8GF6swZD4TbE4YQYeC/d313c89fdbd0abca57787aca76175c61/cfr0z3n_realistic_hyper_detailed_minimalist_sci-fi_splash_page__733c277b-dfb5-4961-b0eb-ce28078a96e6.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n        <item>\n            <title><![CDATA[IBM claims 45% productivity gains with Project Bob, its multi-model IDE that orchestrates LLMs with full repository context]]></title>\n            <link>https://venturebeat.com/ai/ibm-claims-45-productivity-gains-with-project-bob-its-multi-model-ide-that</link>\n            <guid isPermaLink=\"false\">63LRc0Rddnz0zN3wYkPGzE</guid>\n            <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate>\n            <description><![CDATA[<p>For many enterprises, there continue to be barriers to fully adopting and benefiting from agentic AI.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/\"><u>IBM</u></a><u> </u>is betting the blocker isn&#x27;t building AI agents but governing them in production.</p><p>At its TechXchange 2025 conference today, IBM unveiled a series of capabilities designed to bridge the gap: Project Bob, an AI-first IDE that orchestrates multiple LLMs to automate application modernization; AgentOps for real-time agent governance; and the first integration of open-source<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/datastax-acquires-langflow-to-accelerate-enterprise-generative-ai-app-development\"> <u>Langflow</u></a> into<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/agents-are-key-to-enterprise-ai-success-heres-ibms-plan-on-how-to-make-it-happen\"> <u>watsonx Orchestrate</u></a>, IBM&#x27;s platform for deploying and managing AI agents.

The system routes tasks to whichever LLM is best suited, balancing accuracy, latency and cost in real time.</p><p>&quot;It understands the entire repository, development intent and security standards, enabling developers to design, debug, refactor and modernize code without breaking flow,” he said.</p><p>Among 6,000 early adopters within IBM, 95% used Bob for task completion rather than code generation. The tool integrates DevSecOps practices like vulnerability detection and compliance checks directly into the IDE.</p><p>&quot;Bob goes beyond code assistance — it orchestrates intelligence across the entire software development lifecycle, helping teams ship secure, modern software faster,&quot; he said.</p><h2>Project Bob benefits from new Anthropic partnership</h2><p>Part of Project Bob is a new partnership between IBM and Anthropic</p><p>The two vendors announced a partnership to integrate Claude models directly into the watsonx portfolio, starting with Project Bob. The collaboration extends beyond model integration to include what IBM describes as a first-of-its-kind guide for enterprise AI agent deployment.</p><p>IBM and Anthropic co-created &quot;<a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/1443d5dd174f42e6\"><u>A Guide to Architecting Secure Enterprise AI Agents with MCP Servers</u></a>,&quot; focused on the Agent Development Lifecycle (ADLC). The ADLC framework provides a structured approach to designing, deploying and managing enterprise AI systems. MCP refers to Model Context Protocol, Anthropic&#x27;s widely embraced open standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems and data they need to work with.</p><h2>Making it easier to build enterprise-grade AI agents</h2><p>In addition to Project Bob, IBM announced that it is extending its watsonx Orchestrate technology to integrate the open source Langflow visual agent builder. Langflow is an open-source technology that is led by DataStax, which itself was acquired by IBM in May of this year. The integration of Langflow is intended to address what Aziza calls the &quot;prototype to production chasm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Today, there&#x27;s no seamless path from open-source prototyping to enterprise-grade systems that are reliable, compliant and scalable,&quot; Aziza said. &quot;Watsonx Orchestrate transforms Langflow-like agentic composition into an enterprise-grade orchestration platform<b> </b>by adding governance, security, scalability, compliance, and operational robustness — making it production-ready for mission-critical use.” </p><p>Aziza explained that the integration of Langflow with watsonx Orchestration brings critical capabilities on top of the open-source tool including:</p><p><b>Agent lifecycle framework</b>: Provisioning, versioning, deployment and monitoring with multi-agent coordination and role-based access.</p><p><b>Integrated AI governance</b>: Embedded watsonx.governance provides audit trails, explainability for agent decisions, bias and drift monitoring and policy enforcement. Langflow has no native governance controls.</p><p><b>Enterprise infrastructure</b>: SaaS or on-premises hosting with data isolation, SSO/LDAP integration and fine-grained permissions. Langflow users must manage their own infrastructure and security.</p><p><b>No-code and pro-code options</b>: Langflow is &quot;low-code.&quot; IBM added a visual, no-code Agent Builder and a pro-code Agent Development Kit for seamless promotion from prototype to production.</p><p><b>Pre-built domain agents</b>: Catalog of HR, IT and finance agents integrated with Workday, SAP and ServiceNow.</p><p><b>Production observability</b>: Built-in dashboards, analytics and enterprise support SLAs with continuous performance monitoring.</p><h2>AgentOps and Agentic Workflows: From building to governing</h2><p>IBM is also introducing two new capabilities to watsonx Orchestrate that work in tandem with the Langflow integration: Agentic Workflows for standardized agent coordination and AgentOps for production governance. </p><p>Agentic Workflows addresses what Aziza calls the &quot;brittle scripts&quot; problem. Today developers build agents using custom scripts that break when scaled across enterprise environments. Agentic Workflows provides standardized, reusable flows that sequence multiple agents and tools consistently. This connects directly to the Langflow integration. While Langflow provides the visual interface for building individual agents, Agentic Workflows handles the orchestration layer, coordinating multiple agents and tools into repeatable enterprise processes. </p><p>AgentOps then provides the governance and observability for those running workflows. The new built-in observability layer provides real-time monitoring and policy-based controls across the full agent lifecycle.</p><p>The governance gap becomes concrete in enterprise scenarios. Without AgentOps, an HR onboarding agent might set up benefits and payroll but teams lack visibility into whether it&#x27;s applying policies correctly until problems surface. With AgentOps, every action is monitored in real time, allowing anomalies to be flagged and corrected immediately.</p><h2>What this means for enterprises</h2><p>Technical debt is something that many organizations struggle with and it can represent a non-trivial barrier for organizations looking to get into agentic AI deployments.\n\nProject Bob&#x27;s value proposition is clearest for organizations with significant legacy Java codebases. The 45% productivity gains IBM measured internally suggest meaningful acceleration for Java 8 to more modern versions of Java and framework upgrades from Struts or JSF to modern architectures. However, these metrics come from IBM developers working on IBM systems. The critical unknown is whether the multi-model orchestration delivers the same results on customer codebases with different architectural patterns, technical debt profiles and team skill levels.</p><p>The Langflow integration addresses a genuine gap for teams already using open source agent frameworks. The challenge isn&#x27;t building agents with tools like LangChain, LangGraph or n8n. It&#x27;s adding the governance layer, lifecycle management, enterprise security controls and observability required for production deployment.</p><p>For enterprises looking to lead in AI adoption, IBM&#x27;s announcements serve to reinforce the fact that governance infrastructure is now table stakes<b>.</b> You can build agents quickly with existing tools. Scaling them safely requires the lifecycle management, observability and policy controls.</p><p>Project Bob is now available in private tech preview with broader availability expected in the future. IBM is accepting access requests through its developer portal. Its AgentOps and agentic workflows integrations are now available in watsonx Orchestrate, while its Langflow integration is expected to be generally available at the end of this month.</p><p>\n\n</p>]]></description>\n            <category>AI</category>\n            <enclosure url=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/jdtwqhzvc2n1/1KaPgJ6Dv1ujagh0OQt10H/faa327ac91ec31ae438c00d1aefe5604/IBM_project_Bob_2-smk.png\" length=\"0\" type=\"image/png\"/>\n        </item>\n    </channel>\n</rss>"

It aims to democratise the creation and use of AI-powered agents for automating complex workflows and boosting productivity across entire organisations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, introduced the new offering, explaining that as customers moved beyond simply building applications with AI, the company saw them &#8220;advancing to build agents&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemini Enterprise is Google&#8217;s answer to this evolution, bundling its entire AI stack into a cohesive user experience that allows developers and business users alike to build agents with a no-code workbench.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform is built on six core components. The &#8220;brains&#8221; are Google&#8217;s powerful Gemini models, including the newly available Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. The “workbench&#8221; is the agent creation and orchestration technology pioneered with Agentspace, allowing any user to manage agents and automate processes. Finally, this is complemented by the “taskforce,&#8221; a suite of pre-built Google agents for specialised jobs like the new Code Assist Agent and the Deep Research Agent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make these agents effective, there is deep integration with a company&#8217;s data through new connectors for systems like Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Box, Confluence, and Jira. Kurian explained the system&#8217;s intelligence, stating, &#8220;We remember who you are and what you do and use it to personalise the context you have when we work with a large language model&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A central &#8220;governance&#8221; framework allows organisations to monitor, secure, and audit all agents from one place, with protections like Model Armor now built-in. Finally, the platform is built on an open &#8220;ecosystem&#8221; of over 100,000 partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-gemini-enterprise-a-glimpse-into-the-future-of-work\">Gemini Enterprise: A glimpse into the future of work</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To demonstrate the platform&#8217;s capabilities, Maryam Gholami walked through a practical use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The beauty of Gemini Enterprise is that it offers the familiar interface of the Gemini but built for enterprise workflows, including full control to enable or disable any of the sources as needed,&#8221; Gholami said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a custom &#8216;campaigns agent&#8217;, she used four different agents to handle market research, media generation, team communications, and inventory management. The agent identified a market trend towards sci-fi themes, flagged a 25 percent inventory gap, created a purchase order in ServiceNow, drafted an email to store managers, and generated social media assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gemini Enterprise is more than just a chat interface,&#8221; Gholami concluded after the demonstration. &#8220;It&#8217;s an end-to-end AI system that unifies your data, your tools, and your teams, turning weeks of complex work into a single, streamlined conversation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/google-cloud-gemini-enterprise-marketing.gif\" alt=\"Example of an AI agent for marketing using Google Cloud Gemini Enterprise.\" class=\"wp-image-109827\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-customers-drive-transformation-with-ai-fleets\">Customers drive transformation with AI fleets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Proving the platform&#8217;s real-world value, Nirmal Saverimuttu, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.virginvoyages.com/\">Virgin Voyages</a>, shared his perspective that &#8220;any major disruption like AI requires a cultural transformation to be successful&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Importantly, Saverimuttu stressed that AI&#8217;s role is to work alongside, not replace, his team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our people are our biggest asset. AI. And never replace our people,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;To me, AI is about getting the best from our people. It&#8217;s about unleashing human potential&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cruise line has deployed a fleet of over 50 specialised AI agents company-wide. The first, &#8216;Email Ellie&#8217;, has boosted content production speed by 40 percent and contributed to a 28 percent year-over-year increase in July sales. Saverimuttu also noted welcome operational gains, including a &#8220;35 percent reduction in agency dependency costs, resulting in creative independence&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another early adopter is <a href=\"https://www.macquarie.com.au/\">Macquarie Bank</a>. The bank, one of Australia&#8217;s largest, has rolled out Gemini Enterprise to every employee and reports that 99 percent of its staff have already completed generative AI training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google emphasised that Gemini Enterprise is an open platform, with partners like Box, Salesforce, and ServiceNow announcing compatible agents. A new AI agent finder will also help customers discover thousands of validated partner solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Gordon Food Service empowers every employee with Gemini Enterprise\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YEkyJaFmQ6o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To support adoption, Google has also launched Google Skills, a new free learning platform with 3,000 courses. As part of this, the company announced the Gemini Enterprise Agent Ready (GEAR) program; an educational sprint designed to enable one million developers to build and deploy agents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-pricing-and-availability-of-gemini-enterprise\">Pricing and availability of Gemini Enterprise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gemini Enterprise is available globally in all countries where Google Cloud products are sold. Gemini Business, for small businesses, starts at $21 per seat per month, while Gemini Enterprise Standard and Plus editions for larger organisations start at $30 per seat per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Kurian, the launch is about democratising powerful technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Gemini Enterprise technology is really about reimagining a super powerful AI technology [for the workplace] but making it super easy to use and putting it in the hands of every company and every user in those companies,&#8221; Kurian concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/ai-value-remains-elusive-despite-soaring-investment/\"><strong>AI value remains elusive despite soaring investment</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Broadcom fired the first salvo in mid-August with its &#8220;Jericho 4&#8221; StrataDNX switch/router chips, which began sampling and also offered 51.2 Tb/sec of aggregate bandwidth backed by HBM memory for deep packet buffering to manage congestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two weeks after Broadcom&#8217;s announcement, Nvidia unveiled its <a href=\"http://What happens when AI data centres run out of space? NVIDIA’s new solution explained\">Spectrum-XGS scale-across network</a>—a notably cheeky name given that Broadcom&#8217;s &#8220;Trident&#8221; and &#8220;Tomahawk&#8221; switch ASICs belong to the StrataXGS family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nvidia secured CoreWeave as its anchor customer but provided limited technical details about the Spectrum-XGS ASICs. Now Cisco is rolling out its own components for the scale-across networking market, setting up a three-way competition among networking heavyweights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-problem-ai-is-too-big-for-one-building\">The problem: AI is too big for one building</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand why multiple vendors are rushing into this space, consider the scale of modern AI infrastructure. Training large language models or running complex AI systems requires thousands of high-powered processors working in concert, generating enormous amounts of heat and consuming massive amounts of electricity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data centres are hitting hard limits—not just on available space, but on&nbsp;how much&nbsp;power they can supply and cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;AI compute is outgrowing the capacity of even the largest data centre, driving the need for reliable, secure connection of data centres hundreds of miles apart,&#8221; said Martin Lund, Executive Vice President of Cisco&#8217;s Common Hardware Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The industry has traditionally addressed capacity challenges through two approaches: scaling up (adding more capability to individual systems) or scaling out (connecting more systems within the same facility).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But both strategies are reaching their limits. Data centres are running out of physical space, power grids can&#8217;t supply enough electricity, and cooling systems can&#8217;t dissipate the heat fast enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This&nbsp;forces a third approach: &#8220;scale-across,&#8221; distributing AI workloads across multiple data centres that might be in different cities or even&nbsp;different&nbsp;states. However, this creates a new problem—the connections between these facilities become critical bottlenecks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-traditional-routers-fall-short\">Why traditional routers fall short</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI workloads behave differently from typical data centre traffic. Training runs generate massive, bursty traffic patterns—periods of intense data movement followed by relative quiet. If the network connecting data centres can&#8217;t absorb these surges, everything slows down, wasting expensive computing resources and, critically, time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional routing equipment&nbsp;wasn&#8217;t designed&nbsp;for this. Most routers prioritise either raw speed or sophisticated traffic management, but struggle to deliver both simultaneously while maintaining reasonable power consumption. For AI data centre interconnect applications, organisations need all three: speed, intelligent buffering, and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cisco-s-answer-the-8223-system\">Cisco&#8217;s answer: The 8223 system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cisco&#8217;s 8223 system represents a departure from general-purpose routing equipment. Housed in a compact three-rack-unit chassis, it delivers 64 ports of 800-gigabit connectivity—currently the highest density available in a fixed routing system. More importantly, it can process over 20 billion packets per second and scale up to three Exabytes per second of interconnect bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system&#8217;s distinguishing feature is deep buffering capability, enabled by the P200 chip. Think of buffers as temporary holding areas for data—like a reservoir that catches water during heavy rain.&nbsp;When AI training generates traffic surges, the 8223&#8217;s buffers absorb the spike, preventing network congestion that would otherwise slow down expensive GPU clusters&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;idle waiting for data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power efficiency is another critical advantage. As a 3RU system, the 8223 achieves what Cisco describes as &#8220;switch-like power efficiency&#8221; while maintaining routing capabilities—crucial when data centres are already straining power budgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also supports 800G coherent optics, enabling connections spanning up to 1,000 kilometres between facilities—essential for geographic distribution of AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-industry-adoption-and-real-world-applications\">Industry adoption and real-world applications</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Major hyperscalers are already deploying the technology.&nbsp;Microsoft, an early Silicon One&nbsp;adopter, has found the architecture valuable across multiple use cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Maltz,&nbsp;technical fellow&nbsp;and&nbsp;corporate vice president&nbsp;of Azure Networking at Microsoft, noted that &#8220;the common ASIC architecture has made it easier for us to expand from our initial use cases to multiple roles in DC, WAN, and AI/ML environments.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alibaba Cloud plans to use the P200 as a foundation for expanding its eCore architecture. Dennis Cai, vice president and head of network Infrastructure at Alibaba Cloud, stated the chip &#8220;will enable us to extend into the Core network, replacing traditional chassis-based routers with a cluster of P200-powered devices.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lumen is also exploring how the technology fits into its network infrastructure plans. Dave Ward, chief technology officer and product officer at Lumen, said the company is &#8220;exploring how the new Cisco 8223 technology may fit into our plans to enhance network performance and roll out superior services to our customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-programmability-future-proofing-the-investment\">Programmability: Future-proofing the investment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One often-overlooked aspect of AI data centre interconnect infrastructure is adaptability. AI networking requirements are evolving rapidly, with new protocols and standards emerging regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional hardware typically requires replacement or expensive upgrades to support new capabilities. The P200&#8217;s programmability addresses this challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations can update the silicon to support emerging protocols without replacing hardware—important when individual routing systems represent significant capital investments and AI networking standards remain in flux.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-security-considerations\">Security considerations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting data centres hundreds of miles apart introduces security challenges. The 8223 includes line-rate encryption using post-quantum-resilient algorithms, addressing concerns about future threats from quantum computing. Integration with Cisco&#8217;s observability platforms provides detailed network monitoring to identify and resolve issues quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-can-cisco-compete\">Can Cisco compete?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Broadcom and Nvidia already staking their claims in the scale-across networking market, Cisco faces established competition.&nbsp;However, the company&nbsp;brings&nbsp;advantages: a long-standing presence in enterprise and service provider networks, the mature Silicon One portfolio launched in 2019, and relationships with major hyperscalers already&nbsp;using&nbsp;its technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 8223 ships initially with open-source SONiC support, with IOS XR planned for future availability. The P200 will be available across multiple platform types, including modular systems and the Nexus portfolio.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This flexibility in deployment options could prove decisive as organisations seek to avoid vendor lock-in while building out distributed AI infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Cisco&#8217;s approach becomes the industry standard for AI data centre interconnect remains to&nbsp;be seen, but the fundamental problem all three vendors are addressing—efficiently connecting distributed AI infrastructure—will only grow more pressing as AI systems continue scaling beyond single-facility limits.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real winner may ultimately be determined not by technical specifications alone, but by which vendor can deliver the most complete ecosystem of software, support, and integration capabilities around their silicon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/cisco-securing-enterprises-in-the-ai-era/\">Cisco: Securing enterprises in the AI era</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

However, organisations anticipate a 32 percent increase in AI investment by 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey finds that AI and security are the joint top IT priorities for UK organisations over the next 18 months, with 62 percent of respondents citing them as necessary. These are followed by hybrid or multi-cloud strategies and virtualisation, showing a clear direction in the technological focus of British businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the path to AI integration isn’t straightforward. The vast majority of organisations are facing barriers to adoption, with the high costs of implementation and maintenance being the biggest concern for 34 percent of respondents. Data privacy and security issues are a close second, troubling 30 percent, while 28 percent are struggling with the integration of AI into their existing systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A particularly interesting finding is the prevalence of &#8220;shadow AI,&#8221; with 83 percent of organisations reporting the unauthorised use of AI tools by employees. This suggests a disconnect between official IT strategy and the day-to-day practices of the workforce, potentially introducing security risks and inefficiencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to navigate these challenges, UK organisations are increasingly turning to open source software. The survey reveals that 84 percent of respondents consider enterprise open source important for their AI strategy, with similarly high figures for virtualisation, hybrid and multi-cloud, and security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joanna Hodgson, UK Country Manager at Red Hat, said: “This year’s UK survey results show the gap between ambition and reality. Organisations are investing substantially in AI but currently only a few are delivering customer value. In the journey from experimentation to sustainable production, enterprise knowledge and integration with enterprise systems must pave the road to achieving value from AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Openness is a force for greater collaboration, sharing best practice and enabling flexibility. As is the case with successful hybrid cloud investments, open-source will continue to be the bedrock for making AI more consumable and reusable.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey also explored the specific areas of AI that are being prioritised. Agentic AI, which involves systems that can operate <a href=\"https://www.developer-tech.com/news/gitlab-launches-custom-ai-agents-and-knowledge-graph/\">with a high degree of autonomy</a>, is the top priority for 68 percent of respondents. This is followed by the desire to enable broad employee adoption and to operationalise AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The skills gap remains a persistent challenge, with AI being the most urgent area of concern for the second consecutive year. Within the field of AI, the talent shortage is most acute in agentic AI, the ability to efficiently use AI capabilities, and educating the wider business on how to use AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these domestic challenges, there is a strong sense of optimism about the UK&#8217;s position on the global AI stage. 83 percent of respondents believe the UK is either already a global AI powerhouse or has the potential to become one within the next three years. However, this confidence is tempered by a lack of talent pipeline, limited public funding, and insufficient private sector engagement, which are seen as the main factors holding the UK back from extracting value from AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report also touches on the complexities of cloud adoption, which is further complicated by the integration of AI workloads. Internal silos, sovereignty concerns, and unclear return on investment continue to be barriers. In response, UK organisations are prioritising operational control and autonomy, securing the software supply chain, and maintaining flexibility in their choice of IT suppliers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hans Roth, SVP and GM for EMEA at Red Hat, commented: “Organisations want greater operational control and IT resiliency to adapt in a world of constant disruption. The survey results, as well as our daily conversations, show sovereignty prominently on the agenda for enterprise’s ongoing cloud strategies and the budding AI opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Open-source is central to this shift as it provides businesses with the transparency and flexibility to innovate rapidly without compromise.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The findings from Red Hat&#8217;s latest survey show the UK is ready to tap the value potential of AI, but is also struggling with the practicalities of implementation, skills shortages, and the complexities of the technological environment. The strong emphasis on open-source suggests a pragmatic approach, supporting collaboration and flexibility in the pursuit of AI-driven innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/samsung-tiny-ai-model-beats-giant-reasoning-llms/\"><strong>Samsung’s tiny AI model beats giant reasoning LLMs</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Samsung’s work challenges the prevailing assumption that sheer scale is the only way to advance the capabilities of AI models, offering a more sustainable and parameter-efficient alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overcoming-the-limits-of-scale\">Overcoming the limits of scale</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While LLMs have shown incredible prowess in generating human-like text, their ability to perform complex, multi-step reasoning can be brittle. Because they generate answers token-by-token, a single mistake early in the process can derail the entire solution, leading to an invalid final answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Techniques like Chain-of-Thought, where a model &#8220;thinks out loud&#8221; to break down a problem, have been developed to mitigate this. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often require vast amounts of high-quality reasoning data that may not be available, and can still produce flawed logic. Even with these augmentations, LLMs struggle with certain puzzles where perfect logical execution is necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung&#8217;s work builds upon a recent AI model known as the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM). HRM introduced a novel method using two small neural networks that recursively work on a problem at different frequencies to refine an answer. It showed great promise but was complicated, relying on uncertain biological arguments and complex fixed-point theorems that were not guaranteed to apply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of HRM&#8217;s two networks, TRM uses a single, tiny network that recursively improves both its internal &#8220;reasoning&#8221; and its proposed &#8220;answer&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The model is given the question, an initial guess at the answer, and a latent reasoning feature. It first cycles through several steps to refine its latent reasoning based on all three inputs. Then, using this improved reasoning, it updates its prediction for the final answer. This entire process can be repeated up to 16 times, allowing the model to progressively correct its own mistakes in a highly parameter-efficient manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Counterintuitively, the research discovered that a tiny network with only two layers achieved far better generalisation than a four-layer version. This reduction in size appears to prevent the model from overfitting; a common problem when training on smaller, specialised datasets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TRM also dispenses with the complex mathematical justifications used by its predecessor. The original HRM model required the assumption that its functions converged to a fixed point to justify its training method. TRM bypasses this entirely by simply back-propagating through its full recursion process. This change alone provided a massive boost in performance, improving accuracy on the Sudoku-Extreme benchmark from 56.5% to 87.4% in an ablation study.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-samsung-s-model-smashes-ai-benchmarks-with-fewer-resources\">Samsung’s model smashes AI benchmarks with fewer resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The results speak for themselves. On the Sudoku-Extreme dataset, which uses only 1,000 training examples, TRM achieves an 87.4% test accuracy, a huge leap from HRM&#8217;s 55%. On Maze-Hard, a task involving finding long paths through 30&#215;30 mazes, TRM scores 85.3% compared to HRM&#8217;s 74.5%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most notably, TRM makes huge strides on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI), a benchmark designed to measure true fluid intelligence in AI. With just 7M parameters, TRM achieves 44.6% accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 7.8% on ARC-AGI-2. This outperforms HRM, which used a 27M parameter model, and even surpasses many of the world&#8217;s largest LLMs. For comparison, Gemini 2.5 Pro scores only 4.9% on ARC-AGI-2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The training process for TRM has also been made more efficient. An adaptive mechanism called ACT – which decides when the model has improved an answer enough and can move to a new data sample – was simplified to remove the need for a second, costly forward pass through the network during each training step. This change was made with no major difference in final generalisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This research from Samsung presents a compelling argument against the current trajectory of ever-expanding AI models. It shows that by designing architectures that can iteratively reason and self-correct, it is possible to solve extremely difficult problems with a tiny fraction of the computational resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/google-new-ai-agent-rewrites-code-automate-vulnerability-fixes/\"><strong>Google’s new AI agent rewrites code to automate vulnerability fixes</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109805\" style=\"width:800px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Last year, healthcare company Advanced was fined £6 million for losing patient records that, among other details, contained information about how to gain entry to the homes of 890 care receivers. Even the smallest oversights can <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/paypal-fined-2-million-for-cybersecurity-lapse-exposing-user-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create unpleasant headlines</a> and catastrophic fines.</p>\n<p>This is the reality of modern data handling: leaks can be catastrophic, and compliance frameworks like GDPR, HIPAA, and FERPA, plus FOIA requests, require more vigilance than manual redaction can provide. What organizations need is not more staff to ensure proper redaction, but tools that achieve it quickly, reliably, and securely.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/caseguard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CaseGuard Studio</a>, a US-based AI redaction &amp; investigation platform, has built software that automates this manual work with 98% accuracy. It can process thousands of files in minutes, working on data that&#8217;s kept securely on-premises of any file type, including video, audio, documents, and images.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-why-manual-redaction-no-longer-works\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Manual Redaction No Longer Works</h3>\n<p>Redaction is not new, but the tools most people reach for were not built for the complexity of today’s compliance requirements. Adobe Acrobat, for example, offers text redaction but needs manual work on each document. Premiere&#8217;s video editing software requires frame-by-frame subject tracking for <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/video-redaction-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">video redaction</a>, which is slow and impractical. These solutions provide only limited capability and were never designed for departments that process a multitude of redactions on a weekly basis.</p>\n<p>CaseGuard Studio, by contrast, was purpose-built for just this challenge. It can detect 12 categories of PII (personally-identifiable information) in video and images, such as faces, license plates, notepads, and more. It tracks and redacts all PII without needing manual frame-by-frame intervention.</p>\n<p>For audio and documents, CaseGuard Studio supports over 30 PII types, like names, phone numbers, and addresses. Custom keywords, phrases, or sentences can be auto-detected and redacted directly from thousands of documents and transcripts, streamlining compliance in ways manual tools can’t match. It transcribes recordings with high accuracy and can translate to and from 100+ languages, so it can redact sensitive terms in multilingual content.</p>\n<p>What once took days of human labor can now happen in minutes. <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/go/caseguard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CaseGuard Studio</a> automates redaction work with 98% accuracy, up to 30 times faster than manual methods, and because it runs fully on-premise, data never leaves the device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h-what-to-ask-when-choosing-redaction-software\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">What to Ask When Choosing Redaction Software</h3>\n<p>For organizations evaluating redaction software, the decision often comes down to a handful of critical questions that determine whether a platform can deliver on both compliance and efficiency. The following questions are central to making the right choice.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can the software handle every file type we work with?</strong> From scanned forms and handwritten notes to video, audio, and still images, organizations in sensitive sectors deal with more than PDFs.</li>\n<li><strong>Is the platform fully automated?</strong> If redaction still means blacking out text with a Sharpie or scrubbing video frame by frame, the process is slow and prone to error. Full automation ensures accuracy and frees staff for higher-impact work.</li>\n<li><strong>Does the software ensure data never leaves your environment?</strong> On-premise deployment means sensitive files are processed locally, so nothing is exposed to third-party servers or cloud risks.</li>\n<li><strong>Does the pricing stay predictable as you scale?</strong> Per-file or per-minute pricing quickly becomes unsustainable as workloads grow. Look for a flat subscription with unlimited redaction, so costs stay predictable no matter how much data you process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h-evaluating-caseguard-studio-against-the-four-redaction-essentials\" class=\"wp-block-heading\">Evaluating CaseGuard Studio Against the Four Redaction Essentials</h3>\n<p>When assessed against these requirements, CaseGuard Studio was the only platform in our evaluation that consistently delivered across all four redaction essentials.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Auto-redact files from any source</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>From text documents and scanned forms to video, audio, images, and even handwriting, redaction has to cover every format where sensitive information might appear. Missing one identifiable feature, a face in a crowd or an un-redacted license plate, and a single oversight can be the difference between full compliance and a lawsuit. CaseGuard Studio automatically detects and redacts sensitive information across all these file types within a single platform with complete compliance.</p>\n<p><strong>      2. Automated bulk redaction at speed and scale</strong></p>\n<p>Thousands of files can be redacted in bulk, turning weeks of manual effort into minutes of processing. CaseGuard Studio handles workloads up to 32x faster than manual methods, with 98% accuracy, giving organizations the speed and scalability to meet growing compliance demands.</p>\n<p><strong>    3. Your data, your control</strong></p>\n<p>CaseGuard Studio runs fully on-premise, within your secure environment, including air-gapped systems that are completely isolated from external networks. This ensures organizations retain full control of their data, with nothing exposed to third-party servers or cloud risks.</p>\n<p><strong style=\"color: initial;\">   4. Unlimited redaction, no pay-per-file fees</strong></p>\n<p>Pay-per-file pricing quickly adds up, making every additional redaction more expensive. CaseGuard Studio offers predictable pricing under a flat subscription with unlimited redaction, so costs remain the same no matter how heavy the redaction load is.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"See CaseGuard in Action | AI-Powered Redaction Software for Video, Audio, Documents &amp; Images\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/toq6hNK5cCc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of our evaluation, we compared methods and platforms ranging from manual redaction and legacy PDF editors to newer AI-driven tools that have appeared in the last few years. Most delivered partial solutions, treating written documents well but failing on audio, while others blurred faces in video, but weren’t practical to use at scale. Cloud-only options raised sovereignty and compliance concerns that, for many users, would count them out of the running entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CaseGuard Studio was the only platform that consistently met all five requirements detailed above. It supports the widest of file types, from body-cam video to scanned or handwritten forms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio and video are probably the most difficult formats to redact, especially at scale. Here, CaseGuard wins our vote with its AI-powered smarts. It runs fully on-premise, keeps sensitive files under organizational control, and its local AI models are refined with each version release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when many <a href=\"https://caseguard.com/articles/data-protection-and-privacy-cloud-redaction-risk/%20?utm_source=blog-outreach-cloud&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;utm_campaign=AI+News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cloud redaction software</a> licensing models drive up costs as workloads grow, CaseGuard’s flat pricing offers a refreshing change — predictable, transparent, and sustainable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any organization facing rising compliance demands and ever-larger volumes of sensitive data, CaseGuard Studio is well worth a closer look. <a href=\"https://caseguard.com/get-a-demo/?utm_source=blog-outreach-getademo&amp;utm_medium=digital&amp;utm_campaign=AI+News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Click here to book a consultation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\" alt=\"\"/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

From curated videos on Instagram Reels to booking engines that build entire itineraries in seconds, AI is becoming a powerful force in how journeys are imagined, booked, and lived. But this shift raises an important question: is AI giving travellers more freedom, or quietly steering their choices?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit, believes AI can do both, speaking to <em>AI News</em>. In a wide-ranging conversation, he explained how AI is transforming travel discovery, personalisation, cultural exchange, and ethics—and why the industry must set clear guardrails as technology takes on a more active role.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-as-a-travel-companion\">AI as a travel companion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI is changing how people discover destinations. Instead of generic travel lists, platforms now serve content that feels personal. “AI has turned travel discovery into a personal canvas,” Hamidaddin said. “Platforms like Instagram Reels no longer just show ‘where to go’; they curate journeys that feel tailor-made for each traveller.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"785\" height=\"760\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07.avif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-109759\" style=\"object-fit:cover;width:300px;height:300px\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07.avif 785w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07-300x290.avif 300w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FH_official_029f060b07-768x744.avif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Fahd Hamidaddin, Founding CEO of the Saudi Tourism Authority and President of the upcoming TOURISE Summit</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift is not just about convenience. By highlighting lesser-known destinations, AI can spread demand and ease pressure on crowded tourist spots. It can also introduce travellers to authentic local experiences that might otherwise remain hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamidaddin sees the next phase as “agentic AI”—technology that doesn’t just make suggestions but takes action. He described a future where AI automatically rebooks flights disrupted by weather, adjusts itineraries, and reschedules reservations in real time. “That’s frictionless travel—where the logistics fade and the adventure takes centre stage,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ai-personalisation-vs-algorithmic-influence-in-travel\">AI personalisation vs. algorithmic influence in travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-driven booking engines promise hyper-personalised recommendations, matching experiences to individual interests and budgets. This can make planning smoother and more inspiring, but it also comes with risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“They do both,” Hamidaddin said when asked whether AI empowers travellers or guides them without their knowledge. “AI can empower travellers like never before—matching experiences to passions, budgets, and even moods. But unchecked, algorithms can quietly narrow horizons, nudging people toward predictable options. This risk only increases with agentic AI, which will make decisions on travellers’ behalf. That’s why transparency and accountability are non-negotiable. AI should be a compass, not a cage, and travellers must always hold the final word.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-trust-and-transparency\">Trust and transparency</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The balance between personalisation and privacy will shape the next era of travel. As AI systems collect vast amounts of personal data, travellers are more aware of how their preferences, clicks, and searches are used. Hamidaddin stressed that trust is the foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The era of hyper-personalisation must be built on trust. Travellers know their data is powerful, and they’re right to ask how it’s being used,” he said. The solution, in his view, is “radical transparency: explicit consent, clear explanations, and real opt-in choices.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Agentic AI, which can act on a traveller’s behalf, makes this even more important. If algorithms are booking, adjusting, or cancelling plans automatically, travellers need clear ways to control and understand these actions. “True innovation doesn’t just customise the journey; it safeguards the traveller’s confidence and autonomy,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-setting-standards-through-tourise\">Setting standards through TOURISE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamidaddin will lead discussions on these topics at the inaugural TOURISE Summit in Riyadh this November. He sees the summit as a chance to shape global standards for AI use in travel, not just showcase technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The TOURISE is designed to be more than an event—it’s the world’s first platform where government, business, and technology leaders unite to shape travel tech responsibly,” he said. His goals include creating a shared ethical framework for AI, encouraging partnerships to address privacy and workforce challenges, promoting sustainability, and training the global tourism workforce to thrive in an AI-driven industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“TOURISE must set a new benchmark: innovation with integrity,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-cultural-exchange-and-economic-growth\">Cultural exchange and economic growth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI’s influence goes beyond logistics. It is also changing cultural exchange and economic development, particularly in Saudi Arabia. “AI is dissolving barriers—linguistic, cultural, and economic. It’s curating authentic connections that go beyond sightseeing into meaningful exchange,” Hamidaddin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explained how Saudi Arabia is using AI to highlight cultural and historical treasures like AlUla and Diriyah, while supporting artisans, festivals, and small businesses. Agentic AI will help create smoother travel experiences that allow visitors to focus more on culture and less on planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This isn’t just about more visitors; it’s about inclusive growth, mutual respect, and shared prosperity,” he said. By 2030, AI is expected to contribute $135 billion to Saudi Arabia’s GDP, with tourism playing a central role. But for Hamidaddin, the real impact is measured in “bonds between people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ethical-guardrails-for-ai-in-travel\">Ethical guardrails for AI in travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As AI systems take on more responsibility, clear ethical standards become essential. Hamidaddin outlined several priorities: making AI usage clear to users, regularly auditing algorithms for bias, giving travellers control over their data, and designing systems that promote cultural diversity and accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With agentic AI, the stakes rise: when an AI acts on a traveller’s behalf, we must ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability. Agency must never replace autonomy,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-innovation-with-ethics\">Innovation with ethics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The debate isn’t about whether to adopt AI, but how to do so responsibly. Hamidaddin argues that innovation should align with human values and environmental priorities. “It’s not about chasing every shiny new tool; it’s about aligning innovation with human values and planetary needs,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He believes governments, businesses, communities, and travellers must collaborate to agree on shared principles. Agentic AI makes this even more urgent, as decisions may increasingly be made by machines. “Our job is to ensure technology serves people, not the other way around,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-era-for-travel\">A new era for travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hamidaddin is optimistic about what lies ahead. “What excites me most is that travel is becoming transformative again,” he said. He imagines a future where language barriers disappear, itineraries adapt in real time, and every trip supports local communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Saudi Arabia, platforms like “Spirit of Saudi” are already using AI to showcase authentic experiences, from desert adventures to artisan workshops. The next step is agentic journeys, where AI travel companions handle logistics seamlessly, freeing travellers to focus on discovery and connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At TOURISE, I believe we’re not simply shaping tourism’s future—we’re igniting a new era of connection and shared prosperity across the globe,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@socialcut?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">S O C I A L .

Yet as these models stretch into important spaces like real-time supply chain routing, medical diagnostics, and financial markets, something as simple as a stealthy data shift or an undetected anomaly can flip confident automation into costly breakdown or public embarrassment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just a problem for data scientists or machine learning engineers. Today, product managers, compliance officers, and business leaders are realising that AI&#8217;s value doesn&#8217;t just hinge on building a high-performing model, but on deeply understanding how, why, and when these models behave the way they do once exposed to the messiness of the real world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter AI observability, a discipline that&#8217;s no longer an optional add-on, but a daily reality for teams committed to reliable, defensible, and scalable AI-driven products.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-best-ai-observability-tools-in-2025\">The best AI observability tools in 2025</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1.

Without observability, this shift goes undetected, producing subtly degraded diagnoses. With observability, the shift triggers alerts, and the team retrains the model or adjusts preprocessing, avoiding patient harm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Preventing bias and drift</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fintech company notices a sudden, unexplained dip in loan approval rates for a specific demographic. Deep observability enables rapid investigation, diagnosis of data drift due to shifts in an upstream data partner, and quick mitigation, ensuring fairness and compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supporting human-AI collaboration</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customer support uses AI to recommend ticket responses. Observability-powered dashboards flag when auto-generated advice is leading to longer ticket resolution times for one product line. Teams use this to retrain the model, improving both customer satisfaction and business outcomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-choosing-the-right-ai-observability-tool-alignment-scale-and-ecosystem\">Choosing the right AI observability tool: Alignment, scale, and ecosystem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Selecting the best observability platform for AI depends on alignment with your organisation&#8217;s size, complexity, and goals.

The system, aptly-named CodeMender, has already contributed 72 security fixes to established open-source projects in the last six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying and patching vulnerabilities is a notoriously difficult and time-consuming process, even with the aid of traditional automated methods like fuzzing. Google DeepMind’s own research, including AI-based projects such as Big Sleep and OSS-Fuzz, has proven effective at discovering new zero-day vulnerabilities in well-audited code. This success, however, creates a new bottleneck: as AI accelerates the discovery of flaws, the burden on human developers to fix them intensifies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CodeMender is engineered to address this imbalance. It functions as an autonomous AI agent that takes a comprehensive approach to fix code security. Its capabilities are both reactive, allowing it to patch newly discovered vulnerabilities instantly, and proactive, enabling it to rewrite existing code to eliminate entire classes of security flaws before they can be exploited. This allows human developers and project maintainers to dedicate more of their time to building features and improving software functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system operates by leveraging the advanced reasoning capabilities of Google’s recent Gemini Deep Think models. This foundation allows the agent to debug and resolve complex security issues with a high degree of autonomy. To achieve this, the system is equipped with a set of tools that permit it to analyse and reason about code before implementing any changes. CodeMender also includes a validation process to ensure any modifications are correct and do not introduce new problems, known as regressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While large language models are advancing rapidly, a mistake <a href=\"https://www.developer-tech.com/news/ai-pushes-code-faster-but-into-a-bottleneck-of-risks/\">when it comes to code security</a> can have costly consequences. CodeMender’s automatic validation framework is therefore essential. It systematically checks that any proposed changes fix the root cause of an issue, are functionally correct, do not break existing tests, and adhere to the project&#8217;s coding style guidelines. Only high-quality patches that satisfy these stringent criteria are surfaced for human review.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To enhance its code fixing effectiveness, the DeepMind team developed new techniques for the AI agent. CodeMender employs advanced program analysis, utilising a suite of tools including static and dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers. These instruments allow it to systematically scrutinise code patterns, control flow, and data flow to identify the fundamental causes of security flaws and architectural weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system also uses a multi-agent architecture, where specialised agents are deployed to tackle specific aspects of a problem. For example, a dedicated large language model-based critique tool reveals the differences between original and modified code. This allows the primary agent to verify that its proposed changes do not introduce unintended side effects and to self-correct its approach when necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In one practical example, CodeMender addressed a vulnerability where a crash report indicated a heap buffer overflow. Although the final patch only required changing a few lines of code, the root cause was not immediately obvious. By using a debugger and code search tools, the agent determined the true problem was an incorrect stack management issue with Extensible Markup Language (XML) elements during parsing, located elsewhere in the codebase. In another case, the agent devised a non-trivial patch for a complex object lifetime issue, modifying a custom system for generating C code within the target project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond simply reacting to existing bugs, CodeMender is designed to proactively harden software against future threats. The team deployed the agent to apply <em>-fbounds-safety</em> annotations to parts of libwebp, a widely used image compression library. These annotations instruct the compiler to add bounds checks to the code, which can prevent an attacker from exploiting a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This work is particularly relevant given that a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in libwebp, tracked as CVE-2023-4863, was used by a threat actor in a zero-click iOS exploit several years ago. DeepMind notes that with these annotations in place, that specific vulnerability, along with most other buffer overflows in the annotated sections, would have been rendered unexploitable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI agent’s proactive code fixing involves a sophisticated decision-making process. When applying annotations, it can automatically correct new compilation errors and test failures that arise from its own changes. If its validation tools detect that a modification has broken functionality, the agent self-corrects based on the feedback and attempts a different solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these promising early results, Google DeepMind is taking a cautious and deliberate approach to deployment, with a strong focus on reliability. At present, every patch generated by CodeMender is reviewed by human researchers before being submitted to an open-source project. The team is gradually increasing its submissions to ensure high quality and to systematically incorporate feedback from the open-source community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking ahead, the researchers plan to reach out to maintainers of critical open-source projects with CodeMender-generated patches. By iterating on community feedback, they hope to eventually release CodeMender as a publicly available tool for all software developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DeepMind team also intends to publish technical papers and reports in the coming months to share their techniques and results. This work represents the first steps in exploring the potential of AI agents to proactively fix code and fundamentally enhance software security for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/camia-privacy-attack-reveals-what-ai-models-memorise/\"><strong>CAMIA privacy attack reveals what AI models memorise</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"728\" height=\"90\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png\" alt=\"Banner for AI &amp; Big Data Expo by TechEx events.\" class=\"wp-image-109669\" srcset=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18.png 728w, https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-18-300x37.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

As supporters cheered in waves of blue and white, capturing moments on their phones and sharing videos (despite the crushing crowd density), China Mobile Shanghai&#8217;s newly deployed 5G-A network monetisation strategy was being tested in real-time, powered by Huawei&#8217;s GainLeap solution and intelligent wireless infrastructure.</p>\n<p>From the media section, the scale of the technical challenge became apparent – ensuring 80,000 simultaneous users could stream, upload, and transact without network degradation. This was something that required more than additional bandwidth.</p>\n<p>China Mobile Shanghai has become the first carrier in China to launch a differentiated 5G-A experience package, marking what industry observers see as a shift in how telecom operators might address revenue growth in saturated markets.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;5G-A Exclusive Package for Shenhua Football Fans&#8221; is a way to transform the elastic capabilities of 5G-Advanced networks into tangible value that users can perceive and are willing to pay for.</p>\n<p>The technical foundation for this 5G-A network monetisation strategy relies heavily on Huawei&#8217;s technology portfolio, from the GainLeap solution that identifies premium subscribers, to the AI-powered intelligent wireless boards that optimise network performance.</p>\n<h3>The business model innovation</h3>\n<p>The partnership between China Mobile Shanghai and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club offers approximately 200,000 football fans an annual package that combines network performance guarantees with fan-specific benefits.</p>\n<p>Subscribers receive network acceleration on 5G-A, access to all matches via the Migu streaming service, unlimited video ringback tone downloads, and Shanghai Shenhua Football Club merchandise.</p>\n<p>This approach to 5G-A network monetisation addresses what China Mobile Shanghai identifies as an important pain point for the telecommunications industry: how to drive quality growth when user acquisition has reached its ceiling. Rather than competing solely on price or basic connectivity, the package creates value through enhanced experiences in specific use-cases.</p>\n<h3>The technical infrastructure behind the experience</h3>\n<p>For Shanghai Stadium, China Mobile Shanghai implemented an elastic, scalable network capable of handling massive concurrent demand. During the match, with 80,000 users accessing the network simultaneously, 5G-A package subscribers can achieve download speeds of up to 600 Mbps.</p>\n<p>The necessary technical foundation relies on Huawei&#8217;s GainLeap solution, which lets the network identify 5G-A subscribers and allocates them a high-speed 3CC (three-component carrier) channel. The differentiation is key to the 5G-A network monetisation model – creating measurable performance differences between standard and premium subscribers.</p>\n<p>Behind the scenes, Huawei&#8217;s AI-powered intelligent wireless boards play a central role. They integrate on-board communications capabilities with artificial intelligence to perceive network service types, user experience goals, device characteristics, and resource status, in milliseconds.</p>\n<p>According to test data provided by China Mobile Shanghai, they have helped result in QR code scanning latency reduced by 47%, WeChat uploading time shortened by 25%, live streaming speeds increased by 27%, and high-definition video ratios increased by 11%.</p>\n<h3>Infrastructure deployment scale</h3>\n<p>To support the high concurrent demand during events, China Mobile Shanghai and Huawei conducted comprehensive network upgrades at the stadium. The lower stands received 32 new 2.6 GHz and 4.9 GHz pRRUs (passive remote radio units), more than doubling overall network capacity. Seven escalator entrances each received a 4.9 GHz EM device to eliminate coverage dead spots.</p>\n<p>On match days, more than 40 engineers are stationed onsite for real-time network monitoring and dynamic optimisation. Outside of the stadium, China Mobile Shanghai has achieved continuous 5G-A coverage in the area inside Shanghai&#8217;s Outer Ring Road, the five new towns further out, and 21 metro lines in the city.</p>\n<h3>The practical user experience</h3>\n<p>For fans at the match, the differentiated service manifested practically. The high bandwidth and business-level assurance capabilities enabled quick mobile payments for drinks, snacks, and souvenirs onsite. Users could share video highlights in real time without lag, even during peak moments when thousands of fans uploaded data simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The ability to instantly see likes and comments from friends while still in the stadium represents the kind of enhanced experience that China Mobile Shanghai is betting users will value enough to pay a premium for. Whether this bet pays off commercially remains to be seen, but the technical execution at the September 21 match demonstrated that the infrastructure delivers on its promises.</p>\n<h3>Industry implications</h3>\n<p>The initiative raises questions about the future of 5G-A network monetisation strategies in the telecommunications industry. Traditional models have struggled to justify the massive infrastructure investments required for 5G and latterly, 5G-Advanced networks. By creating tiered experiences tied to specific user communities – in this case, football fans – carriers may have found a way to differentiate services beyond simple speed tiers.</p>\n<p>The approach also represents a test case for how deeply integrated AI capabilities in network infrastructure can enable new business models. The intelligent wireless boards&#8217; ability to make millisecond-level decisions about resource allocation is what makes the performance differentiation technically feasible at scale.</p>\n<p>China Mobile Shanghai&#8217;s target of serving 200,000 Shenhua fans provides a measurable benchmark for assessing commercial viability.</p>\n<p>As telecommunications companies globally grapple with how to monetise increasingly expensive network upgrades, China Mobile Shanghai&#8217;s experiment with community-specific, experience-based packages may offer insights for the industry&#8217;s evolution beyond traditional connectivity provision.</p>\n<p><em>(Image source: Smart Shanghai </em>)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&amp;utm_medium=Footer-banner&amp;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

One group of subjects was allowed to use AI (ChatGPT was chosen; researchers considered there was little difference between it and its competitors), the second permitted to use Google Search, and the third group was termed &#8216;brain only&#8217; – that is, producing work with no technology aids.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electroencephalography (EEG) was used on all the subjects to monitor brain activity to asses cognitive engagement and load. The researchers found that the groups exhibited different levels of neural connectivity, which reflected different strategies employed by the brain to write up the assignments. The more support the subjects had, the less hard their brains seemed to work. EEG analysis showed that the most active grey matter belonged to the unaided group, with less neural activity in the &#8216;search engine group&#8217;, and least of all among the AI users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study also examined what it termed &#8216;ownership&#8217; – the ability for the authors to quote what they had written afterwards and summarise their work. Levels of ownership fell dramatically with the more help the subjects received from technology. Few students using an LLM were able to reliably quote what they had written. Additionally, the LLM-using group &#8220;produced statistically homogeneous essays within each topic, showing significantly less deviation compared to the other groups.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, the visual cortex of those using a search engine or ChatGPT was more active, with those groups &#8220;more inclined to focus on the output of the tools they were using,&#8221; the paper states.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-longer-term-effects\"><a></a><a></a> Longer-term effects</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After several rounds of essay-writing, two more groups were formed from the participating subjects, comprising of &#8216;Brain-to-LLM&#8217; and &#8216;LLM-to-Brain&#8217;, which as the names suggest, were subjects that had previously had no technological aids now able to use an LLM, and LLM users henceforth instructed to complete assignments &#8216;solo.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers found that, &#8220;LLM-to-Brain participants showed weaker neural connectivity and under-engagement of alpha and beta networks; and the Brain-to-LLM participants demonstrated higher memory recall, and re‑engagement of widespread occipito-parietal and prefrontal nodes. […] This suggests that AI-supported re-engagement invoked high levels of cognitive integration, memory reactivation, and top-down control.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, humans using their brains to tackle a subject can benefit from using an AI <em>after</em> they have already fully-explored their thoughts, experience, knowledge, and feelings without using technology. But those using AI from the outset show reduced brain activity over time, and were less able to perform cognitive tasks when asked to go ChatGPT-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper states, &#8220;As we demonstrated over the course of four months, the LLM group&#8217;s participants performed worse than their counterparts in the brain-only group at all levels: neural, linguistic, [and] scoring.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-limited-study\"><a></a><a></a> Limited study</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With only a few dozen subjects in the study, the research group were working with a limited sample. The authors admit it will be necessary to use more volunteers that have a more diverse range of backgrounds for more statistically-reliable findings to be uncovered. Yet as AI is used increasingly in schools, colleges, and everyday life, the researchers have highlighted what they term a &#8220;pressing matter&#8221; of a &#8220;likely decrease in learning skills&#8221; that come about as a result of using AI as a replacement for humans&#8217; brains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-conclusions\"><a></a><a></a> Conclusions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the trend of using ChatGPT in place of the very human activities of thinking, considering, and summarising continues, it seems likely that the ability to think effectively will diminish into the longer term. Having an AI add context or additional material later in any process of intellectual consideration produces better results than its use from the outset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engine use fell into the middle ground between unaided thought and being spoon-fed AI-generated materials, according to the paper. However the need by Google, Microsoft, <em>et al.</em> to insert AI-generation into users&#8217; search results (LLM results appearing uppermost on SERPs [search engine results pages]) means that cognitive activity among everyday search users may decline, should they only focus on AI-generated search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research group states that more study is required to understand the long-term effects of AIs on the brain, &#8220;before LLMs are recognised as something that is net positive for […] humans.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(Image source: &#8220;Cognitive testing&#8221; by Nestlé is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/?utm_source=AI-News&#038;utm_medium=Footer-banner&#038;utm_campaign=world-series\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ai-expo-banner-2025.png\"></a>\n\n<p><strong>Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?</strong> Check out <a href=\"https://www.ai-expo.net/\">AI &amp; Big Data Expo</a> taking place in Amsterdam, California, and London.

Every transaction, interaction, and workflow runs on a web app, mobile interface, or API. That central role has made applications one of the most attractive and frequently-targeted points of entry for attackers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As software grows more complex, spanning microservices, third-party libraries, and AI-powered functionality, so do the security risks. Traditional scanning methods struggle to keep up with rapid release cycles and distributed architectures. This has opened the door for AI-driven application security tools, which bring automation, pattern recognition, and predictive capabilities to a field that once relied heavily on manual reviews and static checks.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-best-practices-for-using-ai-appsec-tools\">Best practices for using AI AppSec tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the most value from AI-powered application security, teams should follow some key best practices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Shift security left:</strong> Integrate tools early in the SDLC so issues are caught before production.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Combine approaches:</strong> Use AI tools alongside traditional SAST, DAST, and manual reviews to cover all bases.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enable continuous learning:</strong> Choose solutions that improve over time by ingesting threat intelligence and user feedback.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep humans in the loop:</strong> AI should augment, not replace, human judgment. Security experts are still needed for complex decision-making.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Align with compliance:</strong> Ensure AI-powered findings can be mapped to regulatory requirements like SOC 2, HIPAA, or GDPR.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:25px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-5-best-ai-powered-appsec-tools-of-2025\">The 5 best AI-powered AppSec tools of 2025</h3>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Apiiro</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apiiro.com/\">Apiiro </a>is reinventing the way organisations assess and manage risk in the modern software supply chain. It moves beyond legacy scanning to implement true risk intelligence, offering full-stack, contextual analysis powered by deep AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apiiro brings visibility not only to what vulnerabilities exist in code and dependencies, but also to how changes, developer actions, and business context interact to shape risk. Its AI systems process data from source control, CI/CD pipelines, cloud configurations, and user access patterns, allowing it to prioritise remediation based on business impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Mend.io</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mend.io has rapidly evolved into a cornerstone of the AI-driven AppSec ecosystem, addressing the full spectrum of risks facing software teams today. Using machine learning and advanced analytics, Mend.io is purpose-built to handle the security challenges of code produced by both humans and artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading organisations are attracted to Mend.io&#8217;s unified platform, which delivers seamless coverage for source code, open source, containers, and AI-generated functional logic. Its capabilities extend far beyond detection, enabling rapid, automated, and context-rich remediation that saves engineering time and reduces business exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Burp Suite</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burp Suite has long been a foundational tool for web application security professionals, but its latest AI-driven evolution makes it essential for defending cutting-edge app landscapes. Today, Burp Suite combines traditional manual penetration testing strengths with sophisticated machine learning, delivering smarter scanning and deeper insight than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where legacy DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools might struggle with modern, dynamic, or API-rich applications, Burp Suite&#8217;s AI modules adapt to changes in real time, learning from traffic patterns and user behaviours to uncover anomalies and hard-to-spot vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. PentestGPT</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PentestGPT represents the future of automated offensive security, using generative AI to simulate the tactics of contemporary adversaries. Unlike pattern-based scanners, PentestGPT can devise new attack paths, generate custom payloads, and think creatively about bypassing controls and protections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PentestGPT blends autonomous testing with educational support: security analysts, testers, and developers can interact with the platform conversationally, gaining hands-on guidance for complex scenarios and real-world exploit development.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Garak</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garak is an emerging leader specialising in security for AI-driven applications, specifically, large language models, generative agents, and their integration into wider software systems. As organisations increasingly embed AI into customer interactions, business logic, and automation, new risks have arisen that traditional AppSec tools simply weren&#8217;t built to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Garak is designed to probe and harden these AI-infused interfaces, ensuring models respond safely and preventing AI-specific exploits like prompt injections and privacy breaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-core-features-of-ai-driven-appsec-tools\">Core features of AI-driven AppSec tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While not every solution offers the same features, most AI-powered application security tools share several core capabilities:</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Intelligent vulnerability detection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI models trained on massive datasets of known exploits can spot coding errors, misconfigurations, and insecure dependencies more accurately than static rule-based tools. They adapt over time, improving detection with each new dataset.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Automated remediation guidance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major pain points in AppSec is not just finding vulnerabilities but knowing how to fix them. AI tools can generate remediation advice tailored to the specific context, often offering code suggestions or step-by-step fixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Continuous monitoring and real-time analysis</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of one-time scans, AI-powered tools continuously monitor applications in production. They analyse runtime behaviour, API calls, and data flows to spot anomalies that could indicate an active attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Risk prioritisation</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI can evaluate the severity of each vulnerability based on exploitability, business impact, and external threat intelligence. The ensures that teams focus on the issues most likely to cause real damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Integration with DevOps workflows</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern AppSec tools embed directly into CI/CD pipelines, issue trackers, and developer environments. AI accelerates these processes by automating tasks that previously slowed down builds or required manual oversight.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-building-resilient-software-in-an-ai-world\">Building resilient software in an AI world</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>AI-powered application security is not a single tool, process, or department, it&#8217;s the foundation on which resilient, innovative, and trusted software is built. In 2025, the leaders in this space are not just those who scan for vulnerabilities, but those who can learn, adapt, and protect at the velocity of AI-driven innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From comprehensive risk intelligence and agile remediation to the defense of AI-generated code and AI agents themselves, today&#8217;s AppSec solutions are reshaping what&#8217;s possible, and what&#8217;s necessary, for digital security in any industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Guest author: Or Hillel, Green Lamp</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/news/the-5-best-ai-appsec-tools-in-2025/\">The 5 best AI AppSec tools in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com\">AI News</a>.</p>\n]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"

However, it&#8217;s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br>&nbsp;<br>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>&#8220;Automated Failure Attribution.&#8221;</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\"

Contributions</strong><br>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br>1.<strong> Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize &#8220;automated failure attribution&#8221; as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task&#8217;s failure.<br>2. <strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<br><strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<br><strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<br><strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Exploring Initial &#8220;Automated Attribution&#8221; Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br>&#8211; All-at-Once: This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br>&#8211; Step-by-Step: This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br>&#8211; Binary Search: A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong> <br>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:<br>&#8211; <strong>A Long Way to Go</strong>: Current methods are far from perfect. Even the best-performing single method achieved an accuracy of only about <strong>53.5%</strong> in identifying the responsible agent and a mere <strong>14.2%</strong> in pinpointing the exact error step. Some methods performed even worse than random guessing, underscoring the difficulty of the task.<br>&#8211; <strong>No &#8220;All-in-One&#8221; Solution</strong>: Different methods excel at different aspects of the problem.

State-of-the-Art Models Struggle: </strong>Surprisingly, even the most advanced reasoning models, like OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek R1, find this task challenging.- This highlights the inherent difficulty of automated failure attribution, which demands a higher level of reasoning than what is required for more conventional tasks.<br>&#8211; <strong>The Importance of Explicit Reasoning</strong>:

However, contemporary robot navigation systems face significant challenges in diverse and complex indoor environments, exposing the limitations of traditional approaches. Addressing the fundamental questions of &#8220;Where am I?&#8221;, &#8220;Where am I going?&#8221;, and &#8220;How do I get there?&#8221;, ByteDance has developed Astra, an innovative dual-model architecture designed to overcome these traditional navigation bottlenecks and enable general-purpose mobile robots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional navigation systems typically consist of multiple, smaller, and often rule-based modules to handle the core challenges of target localization, self-localization, and path planning. Target localization involves understanding natural language or image cues to pinpoint a destination on a map. Self-localization requires a robot to determine its precise position within a map, especially challenging in repetitive environments like warehouses where traditional methods often rely on artificial landmarks (e.g., QR codes). Path planning further divides into global planning for rough route generation and local planning for real-time obstacle avoidance and reaching intermediate waypoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While foundation models have shown promise in integrating smaller models to tackle broader tasks, the optimal number of models and their effective integration for comprehensive navigation remained an open question. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"243\" data-attachment-id=\"47239\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1183/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=1080%2C276&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,276\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?fit=950%2C243&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=950%2C243&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47239\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=1024%2C262&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=300%2C77&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=768%2C196&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?resize=600%2C153&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-3.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ByteDance&#8217;s Astra, detailed in their paper &#8220;Astra: Toward General-Purpose Mobile Robots via Hierarchical Multimodal Learning&#8221; (website: <a href=\"https://astra-mobility.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://astra-mobility.github.io/</a>), addresses these limitations. Following the System 1/System 2 paradigm, Astra features two primary sub-models: <strong>Astra-Global</strong> and <strong>Astra-Local</strong>. Astra-Global handles low-frequency tasks like target and self-localization, while Astra-Local manages high-frequency tasks such as local path planning and odometry estimation. This architecture promises to revolutionize how robots navigate complex indoor spaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"478\" data-attachment-id=\"47241\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1184/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=1080%2C543&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,543\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?fit=950%2C478&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=950%2C478&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47241\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?resize=600%2C302&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-4.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astra-Global: The Intelligent Brain for Global Localization</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Global serves as the intelligent core of the Astra architecture, responsible for critical low-frequency tasks: self-localization and target localization. It functions as a <strong>Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)</strong>, adept at processing both visual and linguistic inputs to achieve precise global positioning within a map. Its strength lies in utilizing a <strong>hybrid topological-semantic graph</strong> as contextual input, allowing the model to accurately locate positions based on query images or text prompts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The construction of this robust localization system begins with <strong>offline mapping</strong>. The research team developed an offline method to build a hybrid topological-semantic graph G=(V,E,L):</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>V (Nodes):</strong> Keyframes, obtained by temporal downsampling of input video and SfM-estimated 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) camera poses, act as nodes encoding camera poses and landmark references.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>E (Edges):</strong> Undirected edges establish connectivity based on relative node poses, crucial for global path planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>L (Landmarks):</strong> Semantic landmark information is extracted by Astra-Global from visual data at each node, enriching the map&#8217;s semantic understanding. These landmarks store semantic attributes and are connected to multiple nodes via co-visibility relationships.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In practical localization, Astra-Global&#8217;s self-localization and target localization capabilities leverage a <strong>coarse-to-fine two-stage process</strong> for visual-language localization. The coarse stage analyzes input images and localization prompts, detects landmarks, establishes correspondence with a pre-built landmark map, and filters candidates based on visual consistency. The fine stage then uses the query image and coarse output to sample reference map nodes from the offline map, comparing their visual and positional information to directly output the predicted pose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"950\" height=\"725\" data-attachment-id=\"47242\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/image-1185/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=1080%2C824&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1080,824\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?fit=950%2C725&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=950%2C725&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47242\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=1024%2C781&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=300%2C229&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=768%2C586&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?resize=600%2C458&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-5.png?w=1080&amp;ssl=1 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>language-based target localization</strong>, the model interprets natural language instructions, identifies relevant landmarks using their functional descriptions within the map, and then leverages landmark-to-node association mechanisms to locate relevant nodes, retrieving target images and 6-DoF poses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To empower Astra-Global with robust localization abilities, the team employed a meticulous training methodology. Using <strong>Qwen2.5-VL</strong> as the backbone, they combined <strong>Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)</strong> with <strong>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)</strong>. SFT involved diverse datasets for various tasks, including coarse and fine localization, co-visibility detection, and motion trend estimation. In the GRPO phase, a rule-based reward function (including format, landmark extraction, map matching, and extra landmark rewards) was used to train for visual-language localization. Experiments showed GRPO significantly improved Astra-Global&#8217;s zero-shot generalization, achieving 99.9% localization accuracy in unseen home environments, surpassing SFT-only methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astra-Local: The Intelligent Assistant for Local Planning</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Local acts as the intelligent assistant for Astra&#8217;s high-frequency tasks, a multi-task network capable of efficiently generating local paths and accurately estimating odometry from sensor data.

It begins with a <strong>3D spatial encoder</strong> that processes N omnidirectional images through a Vision Transformer (ViT) and Lift-Splat-Shoot to convert 2D image features into 3D voxel features. This 3D encoder is trained using self-supervised learning via 3D volumetric differentiable neural rendering. The 4D spatio-temporal encoder then builds upon the 3D encoder, taking past voxel features and future timestamps as input to predict future voxel features through ResNet and DiT modules, providing current and future environmental representations for planning and odometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>planning head</strong>, based on pre-trained 4D features, robot speed, and task information, generates executable trajectories using <strong>Transformer-based flow matching</strong>. To prevent collisions, the planning head incorporates a <strong>masked ESDF loss</strong> (Euclidean Signed Distance Field). This loss calculates the ESDF of a 3D occupancy map and applies a 2D ground truth trajectory mask, significantly reducing collision rates. Experiments demonstrate its superior performance in collision rate and overall score on out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets compared to other methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>odometry head</strong> predicts the robot&#8217;s relative pose using current and past 4D features and additional sensor data (e.g., IMU, wheel data). It trains a Transformer model to fuse information from different sensors. Each sensor modality is processed by a specific tokenizer, combined with modality embeddings and temporal positional embeddings, fed into a Transformer encoder, and finally uses a CLS token to predict relative pose. Experiments showed the odometry head&#8217;s excellent performance in multi-sensor fusion and pose estimation, significantly improving rotational accuracy and reducing overall trajectory error.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Validation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Extensive experiments were conducted in diverse indoor environments (warehouses, offices, homes) to comprehensively evaluate Astra&#8217;s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra-Global&#8217;s multimodal localization capabilities were validated through various experiments, demonstrating superior performance in handling text and image localization queries. For target localization, it accurately identifies matching images and poses based on text commands (e.g., &#8220;find the resting area&#8221;). Compared to traditional Visual Place Recognition (VPR) methods, Astra-Global exhibits significant advantages in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Detail Capture:</strong> Unlike VPR&#8217;s reliance on global features, Astra-Global precisely captures fine details like room numbers, preventing localization errors in similar scenes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Viewpoint Robustness:</strong> Based on semantic landmarks, Astra-Global maintains stable localization even with large camera angle changes, where VPR methods typically fail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pose Accuracy:</strong> Astra-Global leverages landmark spatial relationships to select the best matching pose, showing significantly higher pose accuracy (within 1-meter distance error and 5-degree angular error) than traditional VPR, with over 30% improvement in warehouse environments.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\"

planning and odometry heads were thoroughly evaluated. The planning head, using Transformer-based flow matching and masked ESDF loss, outperformed methods like ACT and diffusion policies in collision rate, speed, and overall score on OOD datasets. This highlights the masked ESDF loss&#8217;s effectiveness in mitigating collision risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The odometry head&#8217;s performance was assessed on multimodal datasets including synchronized image sequences, IMU, wheel data, and ground truth poses. Compared to two-frame BEV-ODOM baselines, Astra-Local&#8217;s odometry head showed significant advantages in multi-sensor fusion and pose estimation. Integrating IMU data dramatically improved rotational estimation accuracy, reducing overall trajectory error to approximately 2%. Further inclusion of wheel data enhanced scale stability and estimation accuracy, validating its superior multi-sensor data fusion capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra holds significant promise for future development and applications. Its deployment can be expanded to more complex indoor environments like large shopping malls, hospitals, and libraries, where it can assist in tasks such as precise product location, efficient medical supply delivery, and book organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, areas for improvement exist. For Astra-Global, while current map representations balance information loss and token length, they may occasionally lack critical semantic details. Future work will focus on alternative map compression methods to optimize efficiency while maximizing semantic information retention. Additionally, current single-frame localization can fail in feature-scarce or highly repetitive environments; future plans include active exploration mechanisms and temporal reasoning for more robust localization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Astra-Local, improving robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is crucial, requiring enhanced model architectures and training methods. Redesigning the fallback system for tighter integration and seamless switching is also planned to improve system stability. Furthermore, integrating instruction-following capabilities will enable robots to understand and execute natural language commands, expanding their usability in dynamic, human-centric environments and fostering more natural human-robot interaction.</p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/\">ByteDance Introduces Astra: A Dual-Model Architecture for Autonomous Robot Navigation</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/24/bytedance-introduces-astra-a-dual-model-architecture-for-autonomous-robot-navigation/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>27</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47236</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>MIT Researchers Unveil &#8220;SEAL&#8221;: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</title>\n\t\t<link>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Synced]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 12:58:37 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://syncedreview.com/?p=47227</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>MIT introduces SEAL, a framework enabling large language models to self-edit and update their weights via reinforcement learning.</p>\nThe post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/\">MIT Researchers Unveil “SEAL”: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></description>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of AI self-improvement has been a hot topic in recent research circles, with a flurry of papers emerging and prominent figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman weighing in on the future of self-evolving intelligent systems. Now, a new paper from MIT, titled &#8220;Self-Adapting Language Models,&#8221; introduces <strong>SEAL (Self-Adapting LLMs)</strong>, a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to update their own weights. This development is seen as another significant step towards the realization of truly self-evolving AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The research paper, published yesterday, has already ignited considerable discussion, including on Hacker News. SEAL proposes a method where an LLM can generate its own training data through &#8220;self-editing&#8221; and subsequently update its weights based on new inputs. Crucially, this self-editing process is learned via reinforcement learning, with the reward mechanism tied to the updated model&#8217;s downstream performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MGQwYzg0MGE5ZDk3ZWNhOTFiZGJmOGM5MWFhZmU3ZjZfVEJVbjJ5U3o5TEgxeTVEZjZwWkozdE5PZGozeTN3dnZfVG9rZW46RjJvS2JFMUZWb0NIV0N4S1pCeGMzZFg4blVlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The timing of this paper is particularly notable given the recent surge in interest surrounding AI self-evolution. Earlier this month, several other research efforts garnered attention, including Sakana AI and the University of British Columbia&#8217;s &#8220;Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM),&#8221; CMU&#8217;s &#8220;Self-Rewarding Training (SRT),&#8221; Shanghai Jiao Tong University&#8217;s &#8220;MM-UPT&#8221; framework for continuous self-improvement in multimodal large models, and the &#8220;UI-Genie&#8221; self-improvement framework from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in collaboration with vivo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the buzz, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman recently shared his vision of a future with self-improving AI and robots in his blog post, &#8220;The Gentle Singularity.&#8221; He posited that while the initial millions of humanoid robots would need traditional manufacturing, they would then be able to &#8220;operate the entire supply chain to build more robots, which can in turn build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, and so on.&#8221; This was quickly followed by a tweet from @VraserX, claiming an OpenAI insider revealed the company was already running recursively self-improving AI internally, a claim that sparked widespread debate about its veracity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the specifics of internal OpenAI developments, the MIT paper on SEAL provides concrete evidence of AI&#8217;s progression towards self-evolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding SEAL: Self-Adapting Language Models</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The core idea behind SEAL is to enable language models to improve themselves when encountering new data by generating their own synthetic data and optimizing their parameters through self-editing. The model&#8217;s training objective is to directly generate these self-edits (SEs) using data provided within the model&#8217;s context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The generation of these self-edits is learned through reinforcement learning. The model is rewarded when the generated self-edits, once applied, lead to improved performance on the target task. Therefore, SEAL can be conceptualized as an algorithm with two nested loops: an outer reinforcement learning (RL) loop that optimizes the generation of self-edits, and an inner update loop that uses the generated self-edits to update the model via gradient descent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This method can be viewed as an instance of meta-learning, where the focus is on how to generate effective self-edits in a meta-learning fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=NDFkZjA3MDJjMzZjYWMyMDVhMDRmYmVhZGZjZWE5Y2ZfT0YzUldDMFE2c1g1YjVQaEhPdFBtdG45bjhqOTByWDNfVG9rZW46WTNBdmJwTTV0b0xCSlF4emhPS2NBVUU5bm9iXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A General Framework</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>SEAL operates on a single task instance (C,τ), where C is context information relevant to the task, and τ defines the downstream evaluation for assessing the model&#8217;s adaptation. For example, in a knowledge integration task, C might be a passage to be integrated into the model&#8217;s internal knowledge, and τ a set of questions about that passage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given C, the model generates a self-edit SE, which then updates its parameters through supervised fine-tuning: θ′←SFT(θ,SE). Reinforcement learning is used to optimize this self-edit generation: the model performs an action (generates SE), receives a reward r based on LMθ′&#8217;s performance on τ, and updates its policy to maximize the expected reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers found that traditional online policy methods like GRPO and PPO led to unstable training. They ultimately opted for ReST^EM, a simpler, filtering-based behavioral cloning approach from a DeepMind paper. This method can be viewed as an Expectation-Maximization (EM) process, where the E-step samples candidate outputs from the current model policy, and the M-step reinforces only those samples that yield a positive reward through supervised fine-tuning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper also notes that while the current implementation uses a single model to generate and learn from self-edits, these roles could be separated in a &#8220;teacher-student&#8221; setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Instantiating SEAL in Specific Domains</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The MIT team instantiated SEAL in two specific domains: <strong>knowledge integration</strong> and <strong>few-shot learning</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Knowledge Integration:</strong> The goal here is to effectively integrate information from articles into the model&#8217;s weights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Few-Shot Learning:</strong> This involves the model adapting to new tasks with very few examples.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The experimental results for both few-shot learning and knowledge integration demonstrate the effectiveness of the SEAL framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>few-shot learning</strong>, using a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model, SEAL significantly improved adaptation success rates, achieving 72.5% compared to 20% for models using basic self-edits without RL training, and 0% without adaptation. While still below &#8220;Oracle TTT&#8221; (an idealized baseline), this indicates substantial progress.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MjE5YmIxODllMDlmMjc1MDRkOGM3MWVlNDhiNzlmOThfOVRqYW04NEN3UEtCT3ZmZUR0RFRZSTFSRFk5cTh3eW9fVG9rZW46U0dOOGIySVhQb0FzZzV4RjRmRmNRVnI5bjNlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>knowledge integration</strong>, using a larger Qwen2.5-7B model to integrate new facts from SQuAD articles, SEAL consistently outperformed baseline methods. Training with synthetically generated data from the base Qwen-2.5-7B model already showed notable improvements, and subsequent reinforcement learning further boosted performance. The accuracy also showed rapid improvement over external RL iterations, often surpassing setups using GPT-4.1 generated data within just two iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ykt96hfpn2.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZDQwZTAyN2NmMjYyYjFhNDAyNGY2MTYyNDE2NmMwNGVfOFVHSHdtN2V5NEQ0MGFBdU9kSHJzcjlIQVVPalBtNHhfVG9rZW46VVBOUWJwM0pab0lNMGJ4R0s3NmNXUlAybkFlXzE3NTAwNzA1MjY6MTc1MDA3NDEyNl9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qualitative examples from the paper illustrate how reinforcement learning leads to the generation of more detailed self-edits, resulting in improved performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While promising, the researchers also acknowledge some limitations of the SEAL framework, including aspects related to catastrophic forgetting, computational overhead, and context-dependent evaluation. These are discussed in detail in the original paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Original Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.10943</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Project Site: <a href=\"https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://jyopari.github.io/posts/seal</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Github Repo: <a href=\"https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/Continual-Intelligence/SEAL</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/\">MIT Researchers Unveil “SEAL”: A New Step Towards Self-Improving AI</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/mit-researchers-unveil-seal-a-new-step-towards-self-improving-ai/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>28</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47227</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Researchers from PSU and Duke introduce &#8220;Multi-Agent Systems Automated Failure Attribution</title>\n\t\t<link>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/researchers-from-psu-and-duke-introduce-multi-agent-systems-automated-failure-attribution/</link>\n\t\t\t\t\t<comments>https://syncedreview.com/2025/06/16/researchers-from-psu-and-duke-introduce-multi-agent-systems-automated-failure-attribution/#comments</comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t<dc:creator><![CDATA[Synced]]></dc:creator>\n\t\t<pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 07:39:46 +0000</pubDate>\n\t\t\t\t<category><![CDATA[AI]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Nature Language Tech]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Research]]></category>\n\t\t<category><![CDATA[Share My Research]]></category>\n\t\t<guid isPermaLink=\"false\">https://syncedreview.com/?p=47209</guid>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<description><![CDATA[<p>\"Automated failure attribution\" is a crucial component in the development lifecycle of Multi-Agent systems.

However, it&#8217;s a common scenario for these systems to fail at a task despite a flurry of activity. This leaves developers with a critical question: which agent, at what point, was responsible for the failure? Sifting through vast interaction logs to pinpoint the root cause feels like finding a needle in a haystack—a time-consuming and labor-intensive effort.<br> <br>This is a familiar frustration for developers. In increasingly complex Multi-Agent systems, failures are not only common but also incredibly difficult to diagnose due to the autonomous nature of agent collaboration and long information chains. Without a way to quickly identify the source of a failure, system iteration and optimization grind to a halt.<br> <br>To address this challenge, researchers from <strong>Penn State University</strong> and <strong>Duke University</strong>, in collaboration with institutions including <strong>Google DeepMind</strong>, have introduced the novel research problem of <strong>&#8220;Automated Failure Attribution.&#8221;</strong> They have constructed the first benchmark dataset for this task, <strong>Who&amp;When</strong>, and have developed and evaluated several automated attribution methods. This work not only highlights the complexity of the task but also paves a new path toward enhancing the reliability of LLM Multi-Agent systems.<br>The paper has been accepted as a <strong>Spotlight presentation at the top-tier machine learning conference, ICML 2025</strong>, and the code and dataset are now fully open-source.<br><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"602\"

when a system fails, developers are often left with manual and inefficient methods for debugging:<br><strong>Manual Log Archaeology</strong> : Developers must manually review lengthy interaction logs to find the source of the problem.<br><strong>Reliance on Expertise</strong> : The debugging process is highly dependent on the developer&#8217;s deep understanding of the system and the task at hand.<br> <br>This &#8220;needle in a haystack&#8221; approach to debugging is not only inefficient but also severely hinders rapid system iteration and the improvement of system reliability. There is an urgent need for an automated, systematic method to pinpoint the cause of failures, effectively bridging the gap between &#8220;evaluation results&#8221; and &#8220;system improvement.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><br><strong>Core Contributions</strong><br>This paper makes several groundbreaking contributions to address the challenges above:<br>1. <strong>Defining a New Problem</strong>: The paper is the first to formalize &#8220;automated failure attribution&#8221; as a specific research task. This task is defined by identifying the </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <strong>failure-responsible agent</strong> and the <strong>decisive error step</strong> that led to the task&#8217;s failure.<br><br><strong>Constructing the First Benchmark Dataset: Who&amp;When</strong> : This dataset includes a wide range of failure logs collected from 127 LLM Multi-Agent systems, which were either algorithmically generated or hand-crafted by experts to ensure realism and diversity. Each failure log is accompanied by fine-grained human annotations for:<br><em><strong>Who</strong>: The agent responsible for the failure.<br><strong>When</strong>: The specific interaction step where the decisive error occurred.<br><strong>Why</strong>: A natural language explanation of the cause of the failure.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. </strong>Exploring Initial &#8220;Automated Attribution&#8221; Methods : Using the Who&amp;When dataset, the paper designs and assesses three distinct methods for automated failure attribution:<br><strong>All-at-Once: </strong>This method provides the LLM with the user query and the complete failure log, asking it to identify the responsible agent and the decisive error step in a single pass. While cost-effective, it may struggle to pinpoint precise errors in long contexts.<br><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong> This approach mimics manual debugging by having the LLM review the interaction log sequentially, making a judgment at each step until the error is found. It is more precise at locating the error step but incurs higher costs and risks accumulating errors.<br><strong>Binary Search: </strong>A compromise between the first two methods, this strategy repeatedly divides the log in half, using the LLM to determine which segment contains the error. It then recursively searches the identified segment, offering a balance of cost and performance.<br><strong> </strong><br><strong>Experimental Results and Key Findings</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiments were conducted in two settings: one where the LLM knows the ground truth answer to the problem the Multi-Agent system is trying to solve (<strong>With Ground Truth</strong>) and one where it does not (<strong>Without Ground Truth</strong>). The primary model used was GPT-4o, though other models were also tested. The systematic evaluation of these methods on the Who&amp;When dataset yielded several important insights:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A Long Way to Go</strong>: Current methods are far from perfect.

promise for artificial intelligence, enabling agents to plan and reason in dynamic environments. Recent advancements, particularly with video diffusion models, have shown impressive capabilities in generating realistic future sequences. However, a significant bottleneck remains: <strong>maintaining long-term memory.</strong> Current models struggle to remember events and states from far in the past due to the high computational cost associated with processing extended sequences using traditional attention layers. This limits their ability to perform complex tasks requiring sustained understanding of a scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new paper, &#8220;Long-Context State-Space Video World Models&#8221; by researchers from Stanford University, Princeton University, and Adobe Research, proposes an innovative solution to this challenge. They introduce a novel architecture that leverages <strong>State-Space Models (SSMs)</strong> to extend temporal memory without sacrificing computational efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The core problem lies in the quadratic computational complexity of attention mechanisms with respect to sequence length. As the video context grows, the resources required for attention layers explode, making long-term memory impractical for real-world applications. This means that after a certain number of frames, the model effectively &#8220;forgets&#8221; earlier events, hindering its performance on tasks that demand long-range coherence or reasoning over extended periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The authors’ key insight is to leverage the inherent strengths of State-Space Models (SSMs) for causal sequence modeling. Unlike previous attempts that retrofitted SSMs for non-causal vision tasks, this work fully exploits their advantages in processing sequences efficiently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed <strong>Long-Context State-Space Video World Model (LSSVWM)</strong> incorporates several crucial design choices:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Block-wise SSM Scanning Scheme:</strong> This is central to their design. Instead of processing the entire video sequence with a single SSM scan, they employ a block-wise scheme. This strategically trades off some spatial consistency (within a block) for significantly extended temporal memory. By breaking down the long sequence into manageable blocks, they can maintain a compressed &#8220;state&#8221; that carries information across blocks, effectively extending the model&#8217;s memory horizon.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dense Local Attention:</strong> To compensate for the potential loss of spatial coherence introduced by the block-wise SSM scanning, the model incorporates dense local attention. This ensures that consecutive frames within and across blocks maintain strong relationships, preserving the fine-grained details and consistency necessary for realistic video generation. This dual approach of global (SSM) and local (attention) processing allows them to achieve both long-term memory and local fidelity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"586\" height=\"883\" data-attachment-id=\"47188\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1175/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"586,883\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?fit=586%2C883&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=586%2C883&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47188\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?w=586&amp;ssl=1 586w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-3.png?resize=199%2C300&amp;ssl=1 199w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper also introduces two key training strategies to further improve long-context performance:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Diffusion Forcing:</strong> This technique encourages the model to generate frames conditioned on a prefix of the input, effectively forcing it to learn to maintain consistency over longer durations. By sometimes not sampling a prefix and keeping all tokens noised, the training becomes equivalent to diffusion forcing, which is highlighted as a special case of long-context training where the prefix length is zero. This pushes the model to generate coherent sequences even from minimal initial context.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Frame Local Attention:</strong> For faster training and sampling, the authors implemented a &#8220;frame local attention&#8221; mechanism. This utilizes FlexAttention to achieve significant speedups compared to a fully causal mask. By grouping frames into chunks (e.g., chunks of 5 with a frame window size of 10), frames within a chunk maintain bidirectionality while also attending to frames in the previous chunk. This allows for an effective receptive field while optimizing computational load.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"605\" height=\"729\" data-attachment-id=\"47189\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1176/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"605,729\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?fit=605%2C729&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=605%2C729&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47189\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?w=605&amp;ssl=1 605w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=249%2C300&amp;ssl=1 249w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-4.png?resize=600%2C723&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The researchers evaluated their LSSVWM on challenging datasets, including <strong>Memory Maze</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong>, which are specifically designed to test long-term memory capabilities through spatial retrieval and reasoning tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experiments demonstrate that their approach <strong>substantially surpasses baselines</strong> in preserving long-range memory. Qualitative results, as shown in supplementary figures (e.g., S1, S2, S3), illustrate that LSSVWM can generate more coherent and accurate sequences over extended periods compared to models relying solely on causal attention or even Mamba2 without frame local attention. For instance, on reasoning tasks for the maze dataset, their model maintains better consistency and accuracy over long horizons. Similarly, for retrieval tasks, LSSVWM shows improved ability to recall and utilize information from distant past frames. Crucially, these improvements are achieved while maintaining practical inference speeds, making the models suitable for interactive applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"595\" height=\"339\" data-attachment-id=\"47190\" data-permalink=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/image-1177/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"595,339\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"image\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?fit=595%2C339&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=595%2C339&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-47190\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?w=595&amp;ssl=1 595w, https://i0.wp.com/syncedreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/image-5.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Paper<em> Long-Context State-Space Video World Models</em> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20171\" title=\"\">arXiv</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/\">Adobe Research Unlocking Long-Term Memory in Video World Models with State-Space Models</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/05/28/adobe-research-unlocking-long-term-memory-in-video-world-models-with-state-space-models/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>52</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47184</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>DeepSeek-V3 New Paper is coming!

The paper moves beyond the architectural specifics of DeepSeek-V3 to explore how hardware-aware model co-design can effectively address the limitations of current hardware, ultimately enabling cost-efficient large-scale training and inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AU-vFtGM354SLx9Rm.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The Paper Insights into DeepSeek-V3: Scaling Challenges and Reflections on Hardware for AI Architectures is on arXiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09343</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6451\">The rapid scaling of LLMs has exposed critical bottlenecks in current hardware architectures, particularly concerning memory capacity, computational efficiency, and interconnect bandwidth. DeepSeek-V3, trained on a cluster of 2048 NVIDIA H800 GPUs, serves as a compelling case study demonstrating how a synergistic approach between model design and hardware considerations can overcome these limitations. This research focuses on the interplay between hardware architecture and model design in achieving economical large-scale training and inference, aiming to provide actionable insights for efficiently scaling LLMs without compromising performance or accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e9e4\">Key areas of focus in the paper include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Hardware-Driven Model Design:</strong> Analyzing how hardware characteristics, such as FP8 low-precision computation and scale-up/scale-out network properties, influence architectural choices within DeepSeek-V3.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hardware-Model Interdependencies:</strong> Investigating how hardware capabilities shape model innovation and how the evolving demands of LLMs drive requirements for next-generation hardware.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Future Directions for Hardware Development:</strong> Drawing practical insights from DeepSeek-V3 to guide the co-design of future hardware and model architectures for scalable and cost-effective AI systems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"f3cf\">DeepSeek-V3’s Design Principles: Addressing Core Scaling Challenges</h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A-MtwoD3wGPIBwQYY.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7858\">DeepSeek-V3 incorporates several key architectural innovations, as illustrated in Figure 1 of the paper, including the DeepSeekMoE architecture and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA). These designs directly tackle the core challenges of scaling LLMs: memory efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and inference speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"abab\">Memory Efficiency: MLA and KV Cache Optimization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e0c2\">LLMs exhibit exponential growth in memory demands, outpacing the slower growth of high-speed memory like HBM. While multi-node parallelism offers a solution, optimizing memory usage at the source remains crucial. DeepSeek addresses this bottleneck with Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA), which employs projection matrices to compress the key-value (KV) representations of all attention heads into a smaller latent vector, trained jointly with the model. During inference, only this compressed latent vector needs to be cached, significantly reducing memory consumption compared to storing full KV caches for each head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"72c0\">Beyond MLA, DeepSeek highlights other valuable techniques for KV cache size reduction, providing inspiration for future advancements in memory-efficient attention mechanisms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Shared KV (GQA; MQA):</strong> Multiple attention heads share a single set of key-value pairs, drastically compressing storage.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Window KV:</strong> Limiting the context window for KV caching.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Quantization Compression:</strong> Reducing the precision of stored KV values.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"60fa\">Table 1 in the paper compares the per-token KV cache memory footprint of DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5 72B, and LLaMA-3.1 405B. DeepSeek-V3 achieves a remarkable reduction, requiring only 70 KB per token, significantly lower than LLaMA-3.1 405B’s 516 KB and Qwen-2.5 72B’s 327 KB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2Al0SsgV8-Q9V7A_HZ.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5af3\">Cost-Effectiveness: DeepSeekMoE for Sparse Computation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"075a\">For sparse computation, DeepSeek developed DeepSeekMoE, an advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture (Figure 1, bottom right). MoE models offer two key advantages in terms of cost-effectiveness:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reduced Training Compute:</strong> By selectively activating a subset of expert parameters per token, MoE architectures allow for a substantial increase in the total number of parameters while maintaining manageable computational demands. For instance, DeepSeek-V3 boasts 671B parameters, nearly three times that of its predecessor V2 (236B), yet only activates 37B parameters per token. In contrast, dense models like Qwen2.5–72B and LLaMa3.1–405B require all parameters to be active during training. Table 2 demonstrates that DeepSeekV3 achieves comparable or superior performance to these dense models with an order of magnitude less computational cost (around 250 GFLOPS per token vs. 394 GFLOPS for the 72B dense model and 2448 GFLOPS for the 405B dense model).</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Advantages for Personal Use and Local Deployment:</strong> The selective activation of parameters in MoE models translates to significantly lower memory and compute requirements during single-request inference. DeepSeek-V2 (236B parameters), for example, only activates 21B parameters during inference, enabling near or above 20 tokens per second (TPS) on AI SoC-equipped personal computers — a capability far exceeding that of similarly sized dense models on comparable hardware. This opens possibilities for personalized LLM agents running locally.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A8N5gp31XFnPbEMjo.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4ae2\">Enhanced Inference Speed: Overlapping Computation and Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"cd02\">DeepSeek prioritizes both system-level maximum throughput and single-request latency for inference speed. To maximize throughput, the model employs a dual micro-batch overlapping architecture from the outset, intentionally overlapping communication latency with computation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"76af\">Furthermore, DeepSeek decouples the computation of MLA and MoE into distinct stages. While one micro-batch performs part of the MLA or MoE computation, the other concurrently executes the corresponding scheduling communication. Conversely, during the second micro-batch’s computation phase, the first micro-batch undertakes the combine communication step. This pipelined approach enables seamless overlap of all-to-all communication with continuous computation, ensuring full GPU utilization. In production, DeepSeek utilizes a prefill and decode separation architecture, assigning large-batch prefill and latency-sensitive decode requests to different-sized expert-parallel groups, maximizing system throughput under real-world serving conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"6953\">The paper also touches upon the importance of test-time scaling for reasoning models and highlights the critical role of high token output speed in reinforcement learning workflows and for reducing user-perceived latency in long inference sequences. Optimizing inference speed through hardware-software co-innovation is therefore paramount for the efficiency of reasoning models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a381\">Low-Precision Driven Design: FP8 Training and LogFMT</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"00fd\">FP8 Mixed-Precision Training</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"9f4b\">While quantization techniques like GPTQ and AWQ have significantly reduced memory requirements primarily for inference, DeepSeek has pioneered the use of FP8 mixed-precision training for a large-scale MoE model. Despite NVIDIA’s Transformer Engine supporting FP8, DeepSeek-V3 marks a significant step as the first publicly known large model to leverage FP8 for training. This achievement, resulting from close collaboration between infrastructure and algorithm teams, along with extensive experimentation, significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining model quality, making large-scale training more feasible. Figure 1 illustrates the FP8 precision used in the forward and backward passes during training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"452f\">LogFMT for Efficient Communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"57a1\">DeepSeek also employs low-precision compression for network communication within the DeepSeek-V3 architecture. During EP parallelism, tokens are scheduled using fine-grained FP8 quantization, reducing communication volume by 50% compared to BF16, thereby significantly shortening communication time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"73e8\">Beyond traditional floating-point formats, DeepSeek experimented with a novel data type called LogFMT-nBit (Logarithmic Floating-Point Formats).</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3a44\">Interconnect-Driven Design: Addressing Hardware Limitations</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6918\">Current Hardware Architecture and its Constraints</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"de6a\">DeepSeek currently utilizes the NVIDIA H800 GPU SXM architecture (Figure 2), which, while based on the Hopper architecture similar to the H100, features reduced FP64 compute performance and NVLink bandwidth (400 GB/s down from 900 GB/s in H100) due to regulatory requirements. This significant reduction in intra-node scaling bandwidth poses challenges for high-performance workloads. To compensate, each node is equipped with eight 400G Infiniband (IB) CX7 network interface cards (NICs) to enhance inter-node scaling capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2ArKo4pTKD63B5fbSU.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c1f8\">Hardware-Aware Parallelization and Model Co-design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"2310\">To navigate the limitations of the H800 architecture, the DeepSeek-V3 model incorporates hardware-aware design considerations for parallelization, including: avoiding Tensor Parallelism (TP), enhancing Pipeline Parallelism (PP), and accelerating Expert Parallelism (EP). Specific details of these strategies are available in the original paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e3ec\">A key aspect of model co-design is “node-aware routing” for the TopK expert selection strategy in the MoE architecture. Given the approximately 4:1 bandwidth difference between intra-node (NVLink, ~160 GB/s effective) and inter-node (IB, ~40 GB/s effective per NIC) communication, DeepSeek designed the routing to leverage the higher intra-node bandwidth. By grouping the 256 routing experts (4 per GPU in an 8-node, 64-GPU setup) into 8 groups of 32 experts, each residing on a single node, and algorithmically ensuring that each token is routed to at most 4 nodes, DeepSeek mitigates the IB communication bottleneck and improves effective communication bandwidth during training. Tokens destined for experts on the same node can be sent via IB once and then forwarded via NVLink, reducing redundant IB traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8584\">Scale-Up and Scale-Out Convergence: Future Hardware Directions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"e4f5\">While node-aware routing reduces bandwidth demands, the bandwidth disparity between NVLink and IB complicates the implementation of communication-intensive kernels. Currently, GPU Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) handle both network message processing and data forwarding via NVLink, consuming significant compute resources. DeepSeek advocates for integrating intra-node (scale-up) and inter-node (scale-out) communication into a unified framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bb45\">Integrating dedicated co-processors for network traffic management and seamless forwarding between NVLink and IB domains could reduce software complexity and maximize bandwidth utilization. Hardware support for dynamic traffic deduplication could further optimize strategies like DeepSeek-V3’s node-aware routing. DeepSeek also explores emerging interconnect protocols like Ultra Ethernet Consortium (UEC) and Ultra Accelerator Link (UALink), noting the Unified Bus (UB) as a recent approach to converging scale-up and scale-out. The paper details methods for achieving this convergence at the programming framework level, including unified network adapters, dedicated communication co-processors, flexible forwarding and broadcast/reduce mechanisms, and hardware synchronization primitives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7303\">Bandwidth Contention and Latency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"0faa\">Another limitation of current hardware is the lack of flexibility in dynamically allocating bandwidth between different traffic types on NVLink and PCIe. For instance, transferring KV cache data from CPU memory to GPUs during inference can saturate PCIe bandwidth, leading to contention with inter-GPU EP communication via IB, potentially degrading overall performance and causing latency spikes. DeepSeek suggests solutions including dynamic NVLink/PCIe traffic prioritization, I/O chiplet integration, and CPU-GPU interconnect within the scale-up domain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3982\">Large-Scale Network-Driven Design: Multi-Plane Fat-Tree</h1>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"e8c0\">Network Co-design: Multi-Plane Fat-Tree</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fefd\">For DeepSeek-V3 training, a Multi-Plane Fat-Tree (MPFT) scale-out network was deployed (Figure 3). Each node, equipped with 8 GPUs and 8 IB NICs, assigns each GPU-NIC pair to a different network plane. Additionally, each node has a 400 Gbps Ethernet RoCE NIC connected to a separate storage network plane for accessing the 3FS distributed file system. The scale-out network utilizes 64-port 400G IB switches, theoretically supporting up to 16,384 GPUs while retaining the cost and latency advantages of a two-layer network. However, due to policy and regulatory constraints, the actual deployment involved over two thousand GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AOtuIGcZsxVrUTbvo.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"92c6\">The deployed MPFT network did not fully realize its intended architecture due to current limitations of the IB ConnectX-7. Ideally (Figure 4), each NIC would have multiple physical ports, each connected to a separate network plane but presented to the user as a single logical interface via port bonding. This would allow a single Queue Pair (QP) to seamlessly send and receive messages across all available ports, similar to packet spraying. Native out-of-order layout support within the NIC would be necessary to ensure message consistency and correct ordering semantics, as packets from the same QP might traverse different network paths and arrive out of order. InfiniBand ConnectX-8 natively supports four planes, and future NICs with full support for advanced multi-plane capabilities will significantly benefit the scalability of two-layer fat-tree networks for large AI clusters. Overall, multi-plane architectures offer significant advantages in fault isolation, robustness, load balancing, and scalability for large systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2A8ibInf8M-5okJZ_g.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"3347\">DeepSeek highlights several advantages of MPFT, including its composition as a subset of Multi-Rail Fat-Tree (MRFT) allowing seamless integration of existing NVIDIA and NCCL optimizations for MRFT networks, cost-effectiveness, traffic isolation, reduced latency, and robustness. Performance analysis comparing MPFT and MRFT (Figures 5 and 6, Table 4) revealed that the all-to-all performance of multi-plane networks is very similar to single-plane multi-rail networks, and the performance of MPFT and MRFT was nearly identical when training the V3 model on 2048 GPUs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AO6-6IW1BxXA9snkO.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2Ahwaa9vPQoLilXeQR.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2AxEMD_5lpKKze1_O_.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c430\">Low-Latency Networking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"bd68\">In DeepSeek’s model inference, large-scale EP heavily relies on all-to-all communication, which is sensitive to both bandwidth and latency. Even microsecond-level inherent network latency can significantly impact system performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ec4\">DeepSeek analyzes the latency characteristics of IB and RoCE (Table 5), noting IB’s consistently lower latency, making it preferable for latency-sensitive workloads like distributed training and inference. While RoCE offers a potentially cost-effective alternative, its current latency and scalability limitations prevent it from fully meeting the demands of large-scale AI systems. DeepSeek proposes specific improvements for RoCE, including dedicated low-latency RoCE switches, optimized routing policies, and enhanced traffic isolation or congestion control mechanisms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A875/0%2ATEhtKdIlZaDVR_qf.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"78b7\">To further reduce network communication latency, DeepSeek utilizes InfiniBand GPUDirect Async (IBGDA). Traditionally, network communication involves CPU proxy threads, introducing additional overhead. IBGDA allows GPUs to directly populate Work Request (WR) content and write to RDMA doorbell MMIO addresses, eliminating the significant latency associated with GPU-CPU communication. By managing the entire control plane within the GPU, IBGDA avoids CPU bottlenecks, especially when sending numerous small packets, as the GPU’s parallel threads can distribute the workload. DeepSeek’s DeepEP and other works have demonstrated significant performance gains using IBGDA, leading DeepSeek to advocate for broad support of such features across various accelerator devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"b8d1\">Discussion and Insights for Future Hardware Architecture Design</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d8e0\">Building upon the identified hardware limitations and proposed solutions in specific application contexts, the paper broadens the discussion to offer forward-looking directions for future hardware architecture design:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Robustness Challenges:</strong> Addressing hardware failures and silent data corruption through advanced error detection and correction mechanisms for building non-stop AI infrastructure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CPU Bottlenecks and Interconnect Limitations:</strong> Optimizing CPU-accelerator collaboration, particularly breaking the limitations of traditional interfaces like PCIe for high-speed, bottleneck-free intra-node communication.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Intelligent Networks for AI:</strong> Creating low-latency and intelligent networks with technologies like co-packaged optics, lossless mechanisms, and adaptive routing to handle complex communication demands.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Memory Semantic Communication and Ordering:</strong> Resolving data consistency and ordering challenges in current memory semantic communication, exploring hardware-level built-in guarantees for improved communication efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Computation and Compression in the Network:</strong> Offloading computation and compression capabilities into the network, especially for specific workloads like EP, to unlock network bandwidth potential.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Memory-Centric Architecture Innovations:</strong> Addressing the memory bandwidth crisis driven by exponential model scaling, exploring cutting-edge technologies like DRAM stacking and wafer-scale integration.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c6e6\">The paper delves into each of these areas with specific insights and recommendations, highlighting the need for a holistic co-design approach between hardware and software to enable the continued advancement and accessibility of large-scale AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"d076\">In conclusion, this technical report provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions encountered during the development and training of DeepSeek-V3.

This latest iteration builds upon previous work by introducing an innovative recursive theorem-proving pipeline, leveraging the power of DeepSeek-V3 to generate its own high-quality initialization data. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving and is accompanied by the introduction of ProverBench, a new benchmark for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"09ca\">Pioneering Cold-Start Reasoning Data Generation</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"acb3\">A key innovation of DeepSeek-Prover-V2 lies in its unique cold-start training procedure. This process begins by prompting the powerful DeepSeek-V3 model to decompose complex mathematical theorems into a series of more manageable subgoals. Simultaneously, DeepSeek-V3 formalizes these high-level proof steps in Lean 4, effectively creating a structured sequence of sub-problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"aaf8\">To handle the computationally intensive proof search for each subgoal, the researchers employed a smaller 7B parameter model. Once all the decomposed steps of a challenging problem are successfully proven, the complete step-by-step formal proof is paired with DeepSeek-V3’s corresponding chain-of-thought reasoning. This ingenious approach allows the model to learn from a synthesized dataset that integrates both informal, high-level mathematical reasoning and rigorous formal proofs, providing a strong cold start for subsequent reinforcement learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5fe8\">Reinforcement Learning for Enhanced Reasoning</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7e36\">Building upon the synthetic cold-start data, the DeepSeek team curated a selection of challenging problems that the 7B prover model couldn’t solve end-to-end, but for which all subgoals had been successfully addressed. By combining the formal proofs of these subgoals, a complete proof for the original problem is constructed. This formal proof is then linked with DeepSeek-V3’s chain-of-thought outlining the lemma decomposition, creating a unified training example of informal reasoning followed by formalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"00ba\">The prover model is then fine-tuned on this synthetic data, followed by a reinforcement learning stage. This stage utilizes binary correct-or-incorrect feedback as the reward signal, further refining the model’s ability to bridge the gap between informal mathematical intuition and the precise construction of formal proofs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"c968\">State-of-the-Art Performance</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f1d8\">The culmination of this innovative training process is DeepSeek-Prover-V2–671B, a model boasting 671 billion parameters. This model has achieved remarkable results, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in neural theorem proving. It reached an impressive&nbsp;<strong>88.9% pass ratio on the MiniF2F-test</strong>&nbsp;and successfully solved&nbsp;<strong>49 out of 658 problems from PutnamBench</strong>. The proofs generated by DeepSeek-Prover-V2 for the miniF2F dataset are publicly available for download, allowing for further scrutiny and analysis.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A700/1%2AA4FJp063Twh0PPL5qxWlCQ.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d327\">Introducing ProverBench: A New Standard for Evaluation</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f746\">In addition to the model release, DeepSeek AI has introduced&nbsp;<strong>ProverBench</strong>, a new benchmark dataset comprising&nbsp;<strong>325 problems</strong>. This benchmark is designed to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities across different levels of difficulty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"7c01\">ProverBench includes&nbsp;<strong>15 problems formalized from recent AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) competitions (AIME 24 and 25)</strong>, providing authentic challenges at the high-school competition level. The remaining&nbsp;<strong>310 problems are drawn from curated textbook examples and educational tutorials</strong>, offering a diverse and pedagogically sound collection of formalized mathematical problems spanning various areas:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/miro.medium.com/v2/resize%3Afit%3A220/1%2AtLIp5BCcMScgVl7jsZYusw.png?w=950&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"dfe3\">ProverBench aims to facilitate a more thorough assessment of neural theorem provers across both challenging competition problems and fundamental undergraduate-level mathematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"75e0\">Availability</h1>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"a6be\">DeepSeek AI is releasing DeepSeek-Prover-V2 in two model sizes to cater to different computational resources: a 7B parameter model and the larger 671B parameter model. DeepSeek-Prover-V2–671B is built upon the robust foundation of DeepSeek-V3-Base. The smaller DeepSeek-Prover-V2–7B is built upon DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5-Base and features an extended context length of up to 32K tokens, allowing it to process longer and more complex reasoning sequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"fe97\">The release of DeepSeek-Prover-V2 and the introduction of ProverBench mark a significant step forward in the field of neural theorem proving. By leveraging a recursive proof search pipeline and introducing a challenging new benchmark, DeepSeek AI is empowering the community to develop and evaluate more sophisticated and capable AI systems for formal mathematics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1ada\">Link：<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B</a></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/30/deepseek-unveils-deepseek-prover-v2-advancing-neural-theorem-proving-with-recursive-proof-search-and-a-new-benchmark/\">DeepSeek Unveils DeepSeek-Prover-V2: Advancing Neural Theorem Proving with Recursive Proof Search and a New Benchmark</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/30/deepseek-unveils-deepseek-prover-v2-advancing-neural-theorem-proving-with-recursive-proof-search-and-a-new-benchmark/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>21</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47162</post-id>\t</item>\n\t\t<item>\n\t\t<title>Can GRPO be 10x Efficient?

Recent community efforts have predominantly focused on mathematical reasoning, leaving the challenge of cross-domain generalization largely unexplored. Furthermore, standard Reinforcement Learning from Preference Optimization (GRPO) training is plagued by common issues such as performance bottlenecks, inefficient sample utilization, and difficulties in cultivating specialized reasoning skills when dealing with mixed-domain datasets. These challenges complicate the effective scaling of RL methods for LLMs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Addressing these limitations, researchers from the Kwaipilot team at Kuaishou have introduced a novel reinforcement learning framework: <strong>Two-Staged history-Resampling Policy Optimization (SRPO)</strong>. This innovative approach is designed to systematically tackle the aforementioned training challenges across multiple dimensions. The team has publicly released a technical report detailing the intricacies of their training method and has also open-sourced the <strong>SRPO-Qwen-32B</strong> model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably, this work marks the <strong>first instance of achieving DeepSeek-R1-Zero-level performance concurrently in both mathematical and code domains</strong>. By leveraging the same base model as DeepSeek (Qwen2.5-32B) and employing a purely reinforcement learning training approach, SRPO has achieved impressive results on the AIME24 (50) and LiveCodeBench (41.6) benchmarks, surpassing the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Zero-32B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even more remarkably, SRPO achieves this level of performance with only <strong>one-tenth of the training steps</strong> required by R1-Zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZmEzMDA4M2RhYzZhNTc3YmU2N2NhMzMzNjI0YzYxMDlfYWFqQ3N3ZGN1MWF3UW5oYlE5SlVaNENhclF3WEtIZU5fVG9rZW46TFhJMGJXbEIzb0d4RU54VXBiS2MybHE3bnBmXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges with Vanilla GRPO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In their initial explorations, the Kwaipilot team experimented with the standard GRPO algorithm. However, they quickly encountered bottlenecks that prevented the model from reaching the desired R1-Zero performance levels. These issues included:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cross-Domain Optimization Conflicts (Math vs. Code):</strong> Mathematical problems tend to elicit longer and more detailed reasoning trajectories (Long CoT), while code data exhibits a weaker inclination towards this. Directly mixing these two data types led to conflicts, resulting in suboptimal performance in both domains.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reduced Training Efficiency due to Similar Group Rewards:</strong> The GRPO algorithm relies on the variance of non-zero rewards within a sampled group to calculate the advantage. When rollouts within a group yield nearly identical reward values, the calculated advantage approaches zero. If a significant portion of the training batch exhibits this phenomenon, effective gradient contributions become minimal, drastically reducing training efficiency.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Premature Performance Saturation:</strong> GRPO training encountered early performance plateaus and reward saturation on benchmark evaluations. This issue was partly attributed to insufficient data quality. When the training data lacks sufficient complexity or diversity, particularly with an abundance of simpler problems, the model tends to conservatively maintain its performance on easier tasks, hindering its ability to develop the complex and in-depth reasoning required for challenging problems.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two-Staged Training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To address the inherent response length conflicts between mathematical and code domains, the Kwaipilot team implemented a two-stage training paradigm:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stage 1: Eliciting Reasoning Abilities:</strong> This initial training phase focuses exclusively on challenging mathematical data. The primary goal is to fully incentivize the model&#8217;s test-time scaling, fostering capabilities such as reflective pausing, backtracking, and step-by-step decomposition.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Stage 2: Skill Integration:</strong> In this stage, code data is introduced into the training process. Building upon the reasoning foundation established in Stage 1, this phase aims to further enhance coding abilities while progressively strengthening procedural thinking, recursion, and tool-calling capabilities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comparative Analysis of Training Strategies</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The impact of different training data strategies on response length was analyzed, revealing the following insights:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=YjAyZjA1MzIzY2ZmNjdiNjIzMTlkYjlkY2Q4OTQ5ZjZfUVR3R0FVNVByNEFTTElFN3JHeGxYMTZDRXRmY2x6NWVfVG9rZW46UGRURmJTcXdJb1R0emh4Q29XTmN6dFV1blZiXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mixed Training:</strong> Models trained on a mixture of math and code data showed limited growth in response length and poor benchmark performance. While math problems elicited some reasoning patterns, code problems often resulted in short, direct responses focused on immediate code output with minimal preliminary analysis or planning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Math-Only Training:</strong> Training solely on mathematical data led to a stable increase in response length and excellent performance on math benchmarks. Crucially, it fostered strong and generalizable reasoning abilities; when faced with programming tasks, the model attempted detailed, step-by-step reasoning, including meticulous checking and revisiting steps in mathematical problem-solving.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Code-Only Training:</strong> While showing improved performance on code benchmarks, the development of explicit reasoning behavior was minimal, and achieving significant increases in response length proved difficult. Responses to both code and math problems were noticeably shorter compared to math-only training, with code solutions often being directly generated without substantial step-by-step reasoning or initial analysis.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staged Training:</strong> The two-stage training approach proposed by the Kwaipilot team yielded superior results in both mathematical and programming domains. The model consistently generated detailed step-by-step reasoning for math problems and structured reasoning patterns for programming tasks. Notably, complex behaviors emerged, such as the model spontaneously utilizing code to assist in mathematical reasoning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">History Resampling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team observed that during the mid-to-late stages of training, nearly 50% of the sampled groups within a batch produced identical rewards. This often occurred when the model consistently succeeded on easier problems, leading to minimal reward variance and ineffective gradient updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZWJjZjQ1ODExYzQzMjBjM2FlNWYwZThmYWQ3MTQ0MTRfcEpqYTlyMUZwTmhObG9PWHhQZmxVcVRnNnpwVzFNREpfVG9rZW46S0NLRmJ6dzdMb3NoakF4c3FFUmNZTFk1bkpoXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this inefficiency and improve the quality of the gradient signal, they introduced <strong>History Resampling</strong>. During training, they recorded the reward outcomes of all rollouts within each epoch. At the end of an epoch, they reconstructed the dataset for the next epoch based on the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Filtering Overly Simple Samples:</strong> Samples where all rollouts resulted in correct answers were excluded, as they provided no informative signal for policy improvement.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Retaining Informative Samples:</strong> Samples with diverse outcomes (both correct and incorrect) or all incorrect outcomes were retained. These samples generated positive reward variance, ensuring non-zero advantages and effective gradient signals. Furthermore, difficult samples where all rollouts were incorrect in the current epoch were also kept. The rationale is that these initially challenging problems might become relatively easier for the updated policy, thus generating effective gradients in subsequent training. This strategy aligns with the principle of curriculum learning, gradually exposing the model to increasingly challenging samples on average to enhance training efficiency.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Dynamic Sampling method proposed in DAPO, History Resampling significantly improved computational efficiency and resulted in more stable response length growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team performed meticulous data cleaning and filtering on publicly available Code&amp;Math datasets. They applied heuristic rules to filter out irrelevant URLs, formatting noise, and ensured the completeness of core fields (question and answer ground truth) in the original data. Following the data cleaning approach of PRIME for mathematical data, they removed multi-part questions, pure proof-based problems, and those requiring image or table understanding. For code data, they excluded problems dependent on specific environments, file I/O, or network interactions, focusing on algorithmic logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before data ingestion, they conducted correctness verification for both math and code problems to ensure the accuracy and solvability of the answers, discarding those with incorrect or ambiguous solutions. Subsequently, they assessed the difficulty of each problem, categorizing them into easy, medium, and hard levels based on their pass rate (Pass@k).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Experimental Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This section details the experimental results obtained using the SRPO method. The Kwaipilot team focused on observing the changes in reward and metrics such as response length during training.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Training Process</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=Y2JhZWNhNTc4YzkxYTFkOWU3NTE4ZDE4YjM5Zjk5ODZfVHpQdjJKcFdEdVltOG1taExMblRHaERzWUhPV0U2a3lfVG9rZW46U3FCU2JrSFBob2ZyeDJ4UXVCYWNhZE9sbjVlXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The figure above illustrates the complete reward curve and response length curve during SRPO training. After the initial reward growth began to plateau, the training transitioned into the second stage. At the beginning of the second stage, the overall reward decreased due to the model&#8217;s prior lack of training on code, followed by a steady increase in reward during subsequent training. Integrating code data did not significantly increase the response length, which aligned with their expectations. <strong>Simultaneously, benchmark results indicated a continuous and stable improvement in both the mathematical and coding abilities of the model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the new method.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specifically, History Resampling ensured that gradient updates remained effective at each training step, directly increasing the proportion of informative gradients. This enhanced sampling efficiency led to stable reward growth, clearly showcasing the improved training efficiency achieved by the resampling strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reasoning Behaviors</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kwaipilot team identified three representative reflective patterns: recheck, hesitation, and exploration. They statistically analyzed responses containing these patterns and recorded the average response length for each. During RL training, they observed a gradual increase in the frequency of the model&#8217;s self-reflection, correction, and backtracking, indicating the emergence of a &#8220;self-verification&#8221; ability. They posit that the emergence of &#8220;reflection,&#8221; akin to human cognitive processes, in the model during RL is an adaptive behavior resulting from the policy optimization process.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=MjI3NzQ1ZmQxNzk3OTU2NDNjYjFiNWFhMzBkMGY2MzhfVHhrNVV5TG1ERkxoSjFFVzJBOWMwazU4STRHZXlVNk5fVG9rZW46UXN1emJ6UnVSbzRCYjV4cjBJZmNxYTI2bmhlXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As shown in the figure above, the model exhibited almost no proactive checking and reflection of previous reasoning steps in the early stages of training. However, as training progressed, the model displayed significant reflective and backtracking behaviors, forming response patterns such as step-by-step reasoning, numerical substitution, step-by-step verification, and self-optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://jiqizhixin.feishu.cn/space/api/box/stream/download/asynccode/?code=ZDk1MjJmNmVjOTJhNWY0NGJjOGQ2NTUyZTZlNTdmNzFfWWc1V2RudHdXTUZIUWJVVUsxRmNMaDBxS25sY2hTY3lfVG9rZW46RmJxMWJFcndYb2V1Zk54dU5iTGNVWUJFblFmXzE3NDU0NjEyNDg6MTc0NTQ2NDg0OF9WNA\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, they also discovered that the model learned to spontaneously use program code for verification when solving mathematical problems. It would first provide a solution process through mathematical reasoning and then proactively write program code to verify the correctness of the solution. These instances demonstrated the model&#8217;s ability to leverage procedural thinking for self-correction and multiple attempts, further indicating that in the later stages of training, the model had mastered broad thinking and the integrated application of various code-based reasoning approaches for problem-solving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Paper SRPO: A Cross-Domain Implementation of Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on LLM is on </strong><strong><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14286\">arXiv</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Try with the SRPO-Qwen-32B</strong> <strong>Model on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14286\">HuggingFace</a></strong></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/23/can-grpo-be-10x-efficient-kwai-ais-srpo-suggests-yes-with-srpo/\">Can GRPO be 10x Efficient?

Simultaneously, the company has hinted at the imminent arrival of its next-generation model, R2, building anticipation within the AI community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper, titled &#8220;<em>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</em>&#8221; introduces a novel method that allows GRMs to optimize reward generation by dynamically producing principles and critiques. This is achieved through rejection fine-tuning and rule-based online reinforcement learning [1-1].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This development comes at a time when the paradigm for scaling LLMs is shifting from the pre-training stage to post-training, particularly the inference phase, following the emergence of models like OpenAI&#8217;s o1. This approach leverages increased reinforcement learning (computational effort during training) and more extensive &#8220;thinking time&#8221; (computational effort during testing) to continually improve model performance. Notably, o1 generates a lengthy internal chain of thought before responding to users, refining its reasoning process, exploring different strategies, and identifying its own errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek&#8217;s own R1 series of models has further validated the potential of pure reinforcement learning training (without relying on supervised fine-tuning) to achieve significant leaps in LLM reasoning capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fundamental &#8220;next token prediction&#8221; mechanism of LLMs, while providing vast knowledge, often lacks deep planning and the ability to predict long-term outcomes, making them susceptible to short-sighted decisions. Reinforcement learning serves as a crucial complement, providing LLMs with an &#8220;Internal World Model.&#8221; This enables them to simulate the potential outcomes of different reasoning paths, evaluate the quality of these paths, and select superior solutions, ultimately leading to more systematic long-term planning. The synergy between LLMs and RL is increasingly recognized as key to enhancing the ability to solve complex problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wu Yi, an assistant professor at Tsinghua&#8217;s Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), likened the relationship between LLMs and reinforcement learning to a &#8220;multiplicative relationship&#8221; in a recent podcast. While reinforcement learning excels in decision-making, it inherently lacks understanding. The construction of understanding relies on pre-trained models, upon which reinforcement learning can then further optimize decision-making capabilities. This &#8220;multiplicative relationship&#8221; suggests that only when a strong foundation of understanding, memory, and logical reasoning is built during pre-training can reinforcement learning fully unlock its potential to create a complete intelligent agent [1-2].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A comprehensive survey paper titled &#8220;Reinforcement Learning Enhanced LLMs: A Survey&#8221; outlines the typical three-step process of using RL to train LLMs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Reward Model Training:</strong> Before fine-tuning, a reward model (or reward function) is trained to approximate human preferences and evaluate different LLM outputs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Preference-Based Fine-Tuning:</strong> In each fine-tuning iteration, the large language model generates multiple responses to a given instruction, and each response is scored using the trained reward model.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Policy </strong><strong>Optimization</strong><strong>:</strong> Reinforcement learning optimization techniques are used to update the model&#8217;s weights based on the preference scores, aiming to improve response generation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating reinforcement learning allows large language models to dynamically adjust based on varying preference scores, moving beyond the limitations of a single, pre-determined answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>DeepSeek&#8217;s SPCT: Addressing the Scaling Challenges of </strong><strong>RL</strong><strong> for </strong><strong>LLMs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the success of reinforcement learning in post-training as a breakthrough for enhancing LLM performance, reinforcement learning algorithms themselves still have significant room for improvement, and the &#8220;Scaling Laws&#8221; of reinforcement learning are still in their nascent stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike traditional scaling laws that focus on increasing data and compute to improve model performance, the scaling laws for reinforcement learning are influenced by more complex factors, including sample throughput, model parameter size, and the complexity of the training environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A major hurdle in the scaling of reinforcement learning is reward sparsity. The reward model is a critical component, and generating accurate reward signals is paramount. Achieving both generalization and continuity in reward models is a key focus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeepSeek and Tsinghua researchers addressed this challenge in their recent work by exploring the scalability and generalization of reward models at inference time. Their proposed Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) method aims to improve the scalability of general reward modeling during inference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SPCT approach involves two key stages:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"1\" class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Rejection Fine-Tuning:</strong> This serves as a cold start, enabling the GRM to adapt to generating principles and critiques in the correct format and type.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rule-Based Online RL:</strong> This stage further optimizes the generation of principles and critiques.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve effective inference-time scaling, the researchers employed parallel sampling to maximize computational utilization. By sampling multiple times, the DeepSeek-GRM can generate different sets of principles and critiques and select the final reward through voting. Furthermore, a meta-reward model (Meta RM) is trained to guide the voting process, further enhancing scaling performance. The Meta RM is a point-to-point scalar reward model designed to identify the correctness of the principles and critiques generated by the DeepSeek-GRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experimental results demonstrated that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models on multiple comprehensive RM benchmarks without significant domain bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking Ahead: DeepSeek R2 on the Horizon</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the research paper focuses on advancements in reward modeling and inference-time scaling, the mention of DeepSeek&#8217;s R1 series and the implicit progression suggests that the company is actively developing its next-generation model, R2. Given DeepSeek&#8217;s emphasis on pure reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning, it is highly anticipated that R2 will incorporate and build upon the insights gained from this latest research on scalable reward models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AI community will be keenly watching for further announcements regarding DeepSeek R2, eager to see how the company leverages its innovative approaches to reinforcement learning and inference optimization to push the boundaries of large language model capabilities. The focus on scalable reward models hints at a potential emphasis on even more sophisticated self-evaluation and improvement mechanisms within their next flagship model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The paper <em>Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling</em> is on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495\" title=\"\">arXiv</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>The post <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/11/deepseek-signals-next-gen-r2-model-unveils-novel-approach-to-scaling-inference-with-spct/\">DeepSeek Signals Next-Gen R2 Model, Unveils Novel Approach to Scaling Inference with SPCT</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://syncedreview.com\">Synced</a>.]]></content:encoded>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<wfw:commentRss>https://syncedreview.com/2025/04/11/deepseek-signals-next-gen-r2-model-unveils-novel-approach-to-scaling-inference-with-spct/feed/</wfw:commentRss>\n\t\t\t<slash:comments>12</slash:comments>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<post-id xmlns=\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\">47130</post-id>\t</item>\n\t</channel>\n</rss>\n"

Muh Alumni Award from the School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (SHASS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil offered his signature high-profile forecasts about how AI and computing will entirely blend with human functionality, and proposed that AI will lead to monumental gains in longevity, medicine, and other realms of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People do not appreciate that the rate of progress is accelerating,” Kurzweil said, forecasting “incredible breakthroughs” over the next two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil delivered his lecture, titled “Reinventing Intelligence,” in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building, which opened earlier in 2025 on the MIT campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Muh Award was founded and endowed by Robert A. Muh ’59 and his wife Berit, and is one of the leading alumni honors granted by SHASS and MIT. Muh, a life member emeritus of the MIT Corporation, established the award, which is granted every two years for “extraordinary contributions” by alumni in the humanities, arts, and social sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert and Berit Muh were both present at the lecture, along with their daughter Carrie Muh ’96, ’97, SM ’97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agustín Rayo, dean of SHASS, offered introductory remarks, calling Kurzweil “one of the most prolific thinkers of our time.” Rayo added that Kurzweil “has built his life and career on the belief that ideas change the world, and change it for the better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has been an innovator in language recognition technologies, developing advances and founding companies that have served people who are blind or low-vision, and helped in music creation. He is also a best-selling author who has heralded advances in computing capabilities, and even the merging of human and machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial segment of Kurzweil’s lecture was autobiographical in focus, reflecting on his family and early years. The families of both of Kurzweil’s parents fled the Nazis in Europe, seeking refuge in the U.S., with the belief that people could create a brighter future for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My parents taught me the power of ideas can really change the world,” Kurzweil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing an early interest in how things worked, Kurzweil had decided to become an inventor by about the age of 7, he recalled. He also described his mother as being tremendously encouraging to him as a child. The two would take walks together, and the young Kurzweil would talk about all the things he imagined inventing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would tell her my ideas and no matter how fantastical they were, she believed them,” he said. “Now other parents might have simply chuckled … but she actually believed my ideas, and that actually gave me my confidence, and I think confidence is important in succeeding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He became interested in computing by the early 1960s and majored in both computer science and literature as an MIT undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil has a long-running association with MIT extending far beyond his undergraduate studies. He served as a member of the MIT Corporation from 2005 to 2012 and was the 2001 recipient of the $500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize, an award for innovation, for his development of reading technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT has played a major role in my personal and professional life over the years,” Kurzweil said, calling himself “truly honored to receive this award.” Addressing Muh, he added: “Your longstanding commitment to our alma mater is inspiring.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After graduating from MIT, Kurzweil launched a successful career developing innovative computing products, including one that recognized text across all fonts and could produce an audio reading. He also developed leading-edge music synthesizers, among many other advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a corresponding part of his career, Kurzweil has become an energetic author, whose best-known books include “The Age of Intelligent Machines” (1990), “The Age of Spiritual Machines” (1999), “The Singularity Is Near” (2005), and “The Singularity Is Nearer” (2024), among many others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil was recently named chief AI officer of Beyond Imagination, a robotics firm he co-founded; he has also held a position at Google in recent years, working on natural language technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Kurzweil underscored his view that, as exemplified and enabled by the growth of computing power over time, technological innovation moves at an exponential pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t really think about exponential growth; they think about linear growth,” Kurzweil said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concept, he said, makes him confident that a string of innovations will continue at remarkable speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the bigger transformations we’re going to see from AI in the near term is health and medicine,” Kurweil said, forecasting that human medical trials will be replaced by simulated “digital trials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil also believes computing and AI advances can lead to so many medical advances it will soon produce a drastic improvement in human longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These incredible breakthroughs are going to lead to what we’ll call longevity escape velocity,” Kurzweil said. “By roughly 2032 when you live through a year, you’ll get back an entire year from scientific progress, and beyond that point you’ll get back more than a year for every year you live, so you’ll be going back into time as far as your health is concerned,” Kurweil said. He did offer that these advances will “start” with people who are the most diligent about their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kurzweil also outlined one of his best-known forecasts, that AI and people will be combined. “As we move forward, the lines between humans and technology will blur, until we are … one and the same,” Kurzweil said. “This is how we learn to merge with AI. In the 2030s, robots the size of molecules will go into our brains, noninvasively, through the capillaries, and will connect our brains directly to the cloud. Think of it like having a phone, but in your brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By 2045, once we have fully merged with AI, our intelligence will no longer be constrained … it will expand a millionfold,” he said. “This is what we call the singularity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, Kurzweil acknowledged, “Technology has always been a double-edged sword,” given that a drone can deliver either medical supplies or weaponry. “Threats of AI are real, must be taken seriously, [and] I think we are doing that,” he said. In any case, he added, we have “a moral imperative to realize the promise of new technologies while controlling the peril.” He concluded: “We are not doomed to fail to control any of these risks.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-KurzweilMuh-01-press.jpg?itok=e9r9_zj1\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Ray Kurzweil delivered his lecture, titled “Reinventing Intelligence,” in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall of the Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building on Wednesday.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Hanley Valentin</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/special-events\">Special events and guest speakers</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/alumni\">Alumni/ae</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-corporation\">MIT Corporation</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and MBZUAI launch international collaboration to shape the future of AI</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-schwarzman-college-computing-mbzuai-launch-collaboration-shape-future-ai-1008</link>\n  <description>The MIT–MBZUAI Collaborative Research Program will unite faculty and students from both institutions to advance AI and accelerate its use in pressing scientific and societal challenges.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:10:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-schwarzman-college-computing-mbzuai-launch-collaboration-shape-future-ai-1008</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Terri Park | MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the &lt;a href=\"https://mbzuai.ac.ae/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; (MBZUAI) recently celebrated the launch of the MIT–MBZUAI Collaborative Research Program, a new effort to strengthen the building blocks of artificial intelligence and accelerate its use in pressing scientific and societal challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the five-year agreement, faculty, students, and research staff from both institutions will collaborate on fundamental research projects to advance the technological foundations of AI and its applications in three core areas: scientific discovery, human thriving, and the health of the planet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Artificial intelligence is transforming nearly every aspect of human endeavor. MIT’s leadership in AI is greatly enriched through collaborations with leading academic institutions in the U.S. and around the world,” says Dan Huttenlocher, dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing and the Henry Ellis Warren Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. “Our collaboration with MBZUAI reflects a shared commitment to advancing AI in ways that are responsible, inclusive, and globally impactful. Together, we can explore new horizons in AI and bring broad benefits to society.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This agreement will unite the efforts of researchers at two world-class institutions to advance frontier AI research across scientific discovery, human thriving, and the health of the planet. By combining MBZUAI’s focus on foundational models and real-world deployment with MIT’s depth in computing and interdisciplinary innovation, we are creating a transcontinental bridge for discovery. Together, we will not only expand the boundaries of AI science, but also ensure that these breakthroughs are pursued responsibly and applied where they matter most — improving human health, enabling intelligent robotics, and driving sustainable AI at scale,” says Eric Xing, president and university professor at MBZUAI.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each institution has appointed an academic director to oversee the program on its campus. At MIT, &lt;a href=\"https://web.mit.edu/phillipi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"&gt;Philip Isola&lt;/a&gt;, the Class of 1948 Career Development Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, will serve as program lead.

Whether you’re writing Shakespearean sonnets, debugging code, or need an answer to an obscure trivia question, artificial intelligence systems seem to have you covered. The source of this versatility? Billions, or even trillions, of textual data points across the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Those data aren’t enough to teach a robot to be a helpful household or factory assistant, though. To understand how to handle, stack, and place various arrangements of objects across diverse environments, robots need demonstrations. You can think of robot training data as a collection of how-to videos that walk the systems through each motion of a task. Collecting these demonstrations on real robots is time-consuming and not perfectly repeatable, so engineers have created training data by generating simulations with AI (which don’t often reflect real-world physics), or tediously handcrafting each digital environment from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Toyota Research Institute may have found a way to create the diverse, realistic training grounds robots need. Their “&lt;a href=\"https://steerable-scene-generation.github.io/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;steerable scene generation&lt;/a&gt;” approach creates digital scenes of things like kitchens, living rooms, and restaurants that engineers can use to simulate lots of real-world interactions and scenarios. Trained on over 44 million 3D rooms filled with models of objects such as tables and plates, the tool places existing assets in new scenes, then refines each one into a physically accurate, lifelike environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Steerable scene generation creates these 3D worlds by “steering” a diffusion model — an AI system that generates a visual from random noise — toward a scene you’d find in everyday life. The researchers used this generative system to “in-paint” an environment, filling in particular elements throughout the scene. You can imagine a blank canvas suddenly turning into a kitchen scattered with 3D objects, which are gradually rearranged into a scene that imitates real-world physics. For example, the system ensures that a fork doesn’t pass through a bowl on a table — a common glitch in 3D graphics known as “clipping,” where models overlap or intersect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How exactly steerable scene generation guides its creation toward realism, however, depends on the strategy you choose. Its main strategy is “Monte Carlo tree search” (MCTS), where the model creates a series of alternative scenes, filling them out in different ways toward a particular objective (like making a scene more physically realistic, or including as many edible items as possible). It’s used by the AI program AlphaGo to beat human opponents in Go (a game similar to chess), as the system considers potential sequences of moves before choosing the most advantageous one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are the first to apply MCTS to scene generation by framing the scene generation task as a sequential decision-making process,” says MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) PhD student Nicholas Pfaff, who is a CSAIL researcher and a lead author on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://steerable-scene-generation.github.io/\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; presenting the work. “We keep building on top of partial scenes to produce better or more desired scenes over time. As a result, MCTS creates scenes that are more complex than what the diffusion model was trained on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In one particularly telling experiment, MCTS added the maximum number of objects to a simple restaurant scene. It featured as many as 34 items on a table, including massive stacks of dim sum dishes, after training on scenes with only 17 objects on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Steerable scene generation also allows you to generate diverse training scenarios via reinforcement learning — essentially, teaching a diffusion model to fulfill an objective by trial-and-error. After you train on the initial data, your system undergoes a second training stage, where you outline a reward (basically, a desired outcome with a score indicating how close you are to that goal). The model automatically learns to create scenes with higher scores, often producing scenarios that are quite different from those it was trained on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users can also prompt the system directly by typing in specific visual descriptions (like “a kitchen with four apples and a bowl on the table”). Then, steerable scene generation can bring your requests to life with precision. For example, the tool accurately followed users’ prompts at rates of 98 percent when building scenes of pantry shelves, and 86 percent for messy breakfast tables. Both marks are at least a 10 percent improvement over comparable methods like&amp;nbsp;“&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21066\"&gt;MiDiffusion&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14207\"&gt;DiffuScene&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system can also complete specific scenes via prompting or light directions (like “come up with a different scene arrangement using the same objects”). You could ask it to place apples on several plates on a kitchen table, for instance, or put board games and books on a shelf. It’s essentially “filling in the blank” by slotting items in empty spaces, but preserving the rest of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;According to the researchers, the strength of their project lies in its ability to create many scenes that roboticists can actually use. “A key insight from our findings is that it’s OK for the scenes we pre-trained on to not exactly resemble the scenes that we actually want,” says Pfaff. “Using our steering methods, we can move beyond that broad distribution and sample from a ‘better’ one. In other words, generating the diverse, realistic, and task-aligned scenes that we actually want to train our robots in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Such vast scenes became the testing grounds where they could record a virtual robot interacting with different items. The machine carefully placed forks and knives into a cutlery holder, for instance, and rearranged bread onto plates in various 3D settings. Each simulation appeared fluid and realistic, resembling the real-world, adaptable robots steerable scene generation could help train, one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;While the system could be an encouraging path forward in generating lots of diverse training data for robots, the researchers say their work is more of a proof of concept. In the future, they’d like to use generative AI to create entirely new objects and scenes, instead of using a fixed library of assets. They also plan to incorporate articulated objects that the robot could open or twist (like cabinets or jars filled with food) to make the scenes even more interactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To make their virtual environments even more realistic, Pfaff and his colleagues may incorporate real-world objects by using a library of objects and scenes pulled from images on the internet and using their previous work on “&lt;a href=\"https://scalable-real2sim.github.io/\"&gt;Scalable Real2Sim&lt;/a&gt;.” By expanding how diverse and lifelike AI-constructed robot testing grounds can be, the team hopes to build a community of users that’ll create lots of data, which could then be used as a massive dataset to teach dexterous robots different skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today, creating realistic scenes for simulation can be quite a challenging endeavor; procedural generation can readily produce a large number of scenes, but they likely won’t be representative of the environments the robot would encounter in the real world. Manually creating bespoke scenes is both time-consuming and expensive,” says Jeremy Binagia, an applied scientist at Amazon Robotics who wasn’t involved in the paper. “Steerable scene generation offers a better approach: train a generative model on a large collection of pre-existing scenes and adapt it (using a strategy such as reinforcement learning) to specific downstream applications. Compared to previous works that leverage an off-the-shelf vision-language model or focus just on arranging objects in a 2D grid, this approach guarantees physical feasibility and considers full 3D translation and rotation, enabling the generation of much more interesting scenes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Steerable scene generation with post training and inference-time search provides a novel and efficient framework for automating scene generation at scale,” says Toyota Research Institute roboticist Rick Cory SM ’08, PhD ’10, who also wasn’t involved in the paper. “Moreover, it can generate ‘never-before-seen’ scenes that are deemed important for downstream tasks. In the future, combining this framework with vast internet data could unlock an important milestone towards efficient training of robots for deployment in the real world.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pfaff wrote the paper with senior author Russ Tedrake, the Toyota Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Aeronautics and Astronautics, and Mechanical Engineering at MIT; a senior vice president of large behavior models at the Toyota Research Institute; and CSAIL principal investigator. Other authors were Toyota Research Institute robotics researcher Hongkai Dai SM ’12, PhD ’16; team lead and Senior Research Scientist Sergey Zakharov; and Carnegie Mellon University PhD student Shun Iwase. Their work was supported, in part, by Amazon and the Toyota Research Institute. The researchers presented their work at the Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) in September.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-csail-restaurant.gif?itok=fvPRFM7r\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The “steerable scene generation” system creates digital scenes of things like kitchens, living rooms, and restaurants that engineers can use to simulate lots of real-world robot interactions and scenarios.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Generative AI image, courtesy of the researchers.</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/simulation\">Simulation</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/robotics\">Robotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/internet\">Internet</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Fighting for the health of the planet with AI</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/fighting-health-planet-ai-priya-donti-1007</link>\n  <description>Assistant Professor Priya Donti’s research applies machine learning to optimize renewable energy.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 16:55:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/fighting-health-planet-ai-priya-donti-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Michaela Jarvis | MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For Priya Donti, childhood trips to India were more than an opportunity to visit extended family. The biennial journeys activated in her a motivation that continues to shape her research and her teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrasting her family home in Massachusetts, Donti — now the Silverman Family Career Development Professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and a principal investigator at the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems — was struck by the disparities in how people live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was very clear to me the extent to which inequity is a rampant issue around the world,” Donti says. “From a young age, I knew that I definitely wanted to address that issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That motivation was further stoked by a high school biology teacher, who focused his class on climate and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We learned that climate change, this huge, important issue, would exacerbate inequity,” Donti says. “That really stuck with me and put a fire in my belly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, when Donti enrolled at Harvey Mudd College, she thought she would direct her energy toward the study of chemistry or materials science to create next-generation solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those plans, however, were jilted. Donti “fell in love” with computer science, and then discovered work by researchers in the United Kingdom who were arguing that artificial intelligence and machine learning would be essential to help integrate renewables into power grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was the first time I’d seen those two interests brought together,” she says. “I got hooked and have been working on that topic ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pursuing a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University, Donti was able to design her degree to include computer science and public policy. In her research, she explored the need for fundamental algorithms and tools that could manage, at scale, power grids relying heavily on renewables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to have a hand in developing those algorithms and tool kits by creating new machine learning techniques grounded in computer science,” she says. “But I wanted to make sure that the way I was doing the work was grounded both in the actual energy systems domain and working with people in that domain” to provide what was actually needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Donti was working on her PhD, she co-founded a nonprofit called Climate Change AI. Her objective, she says, was to help the community of people involved in climate and sustainability — “be they computer scientists, academics, practitioners, or policymakers” — to come together and access resources, connection, and education “to help them along that journey.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the climate space,” she says, “you need experts in particular climate change-related sectors, experts in different technical and social science tool kits, problem owners, affected users, policymakers who know the regulations — all of those — to have on-the-ground scalable impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Donti came to MIT in September 2023, it was not surprising that she was drawn by its initiatives directing the application of computer science toward society’s biggest problems, especially the current threat to the health of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re really thinking about where technology has a much longer-horizon impact and how technology, society, and policy all have to work together,” Donti says. “Technology is not just one-and-done and monetizable in the context of a year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her work uses deep learning models to incorporate the physics and hard constraints of electric power systems that employ renewables for better forecasting, optimization, and control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is already really widely used for things like solar power forecasting, which is a prerequisite to managing and balancing power grids,” she says. “My focus is, how do you improve the algorithms for actually balancing power grids in the face of a range of time-varying renewables?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Donti’s breakthroughs is a promising solution for power grid operators to be able to optimize for cost, taking into account the actual physical realities&amp;nbsp;of the grid, rather than relying on approximations. While the solution is not yet deployed, it appears to work 10 times faster, and far more cheaply, than previous technologies, and has attracted the attention of grid operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another technology she is developing works to provide data that can be used in training machine learning systems for power system optimization. In general, much data related to the systems is private, either because it is proprietary or because of security concerns. Donti and her research group are working to create synthetic data and benchmarks that, Donti says, “can help to expose some of the underlying problems” in making power systems more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question is,” Donti says, “can we bring our datasets to a point such that they are just hard enough to drive progress?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For her efforts, Donti has been awarded the U.S. Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship and the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. She was recognized as part of &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;’s 2021 list of “35 Innovators Under 35” and Vox’s 2023 “Future Perfect 50.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next spring, Donti will co-teach a class called AI for Climate Action with Sara Beery, EECS assistant professor, whose focus is AI for biodiversity and ecosystems, and Abigail Bodner, an assistant professor in Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences, holding an MIT Schwarzman College of Computing shared position with EECS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re all super-excited about it,” Donti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to MIT, Donti says, “I knew that there would be an ecosystem of people who really cared, not just about success metrics like publications and citation counts, but about the impact of our work on society.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-LIDS-Priya-Donti.jpg?itok=sHTN9uLy\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“Machine learning is already really widely used for things like solar power forecasting, which is a prerequisite to managing and balancing power grids,” says EECS assistant professor and LIDS PI Priya Donti. “My focus is: How do you improve the algorithms for actually balancing power grids in the face of a range of time-varying renewables?”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Adam Glanzman</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/profile\">Profile</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/renewable-energy\">Renewable energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electric-grid\">Electric grid</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-and-policy\">Technology and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New prediction model could improve the reliability of fusion power plants</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-prediction-model-could-improve-reliability-fusion-power-plants-1007</link>\n  <description>The approach combines physics and machine learning to avoid damaging disruptions when powering down tokamak fusion machines.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-prediction-model-could-improve-reliability-fusion-power-plants-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are machines that are meant to hold and harness the power of the sun. These fusion machines use powerful magnets to contain a plasma hotter than the sun’s core and push the plasma’s atoms to fuse and release energy. If tokamaks can operate safely and efficiently, the machines could one day provide clean and limitless fusion energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, there are a number of experimental tokamaks in operation around the world, with more underway. Most are small-scale research machines built to investigate how the devices can spin up plasma and harness its energy. One of the challenges that tokamaks face is how to safely and reliably turn off a plasma current that is circulating at speeds of up to 100 kilometers per second, at temperatures of over 100 million degrees Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such “rampdowns” are necessary when a plasma becomes unstable. To prevent the plasma from further disrupting and potentially damaging the device’s interior, operators ramp down the plasma current. But occasionally the rampdown itself can destabilize the plasma. In some machines, rampdowns have caused scrapes and scarring to the tokamak’s interior — minor damage that still requires considerable time and resources to repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, scientists at MIT have developed a method to predict how plasma in a tokamak will behave during a rampdown. The team combined machine-learning tools with a physics-based model of plasma dynamics to simulate a plasma’s behavior and any instabilities that may arise as the plasma is ramped down and turned off. The researchers trained and tested the new model on plasma data from an experimental tokamak in Switzerland. They found the method quickly learned how plasma would evolve as it was tuned down in different ways. What’s more, the method achieved a high level of accuracy using a relatively small amount of data. This training efficiency is promising, given that each experimental run of a tokamak is expensive and quality data is limited as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which the team highlights this week in an &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63917-x\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;open-access &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;, could improve the safety and reliability of future fusion power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For fusion to be a useful energy source it’s going to have to be reliable,” says lead author Allen Wang, a graduate student in aeronautics and astronautics and a member of the &lt;a href=\"https://disruptions.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Disruption Group&lt;/a&gt; at MIT’s Plasma Science and Fusion Center (PSFC). “To be reliable, we need to get good at managing our plasmas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s MIT co-authors include PSFC Principal Research Scientist and Disruptions Group leader Cristina Rea, and members of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) Oswin So, Charles Dawson, and Professor Chuchu Fan, along with Mark (Dan) Boyer of Commonwealth Fusion Systems and collaborators from the Swiss Plasma Center in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“A delicate balance”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tokamaks are experimental fusion devices that were first built in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The device gets its name from a Russian acronym that translates to a “toroidal chamber with magnetic coils.” Just as its name describes, a tokamak is toroidal, or donut-shaped, and uses powerful magnets to contain and spin up a gas to temperatures and energies high enough that atoms in the resulting plasma can fuse and release energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, tokamak experiments are relatively low-energy in scale, with few approaching the size and output needed to generate safe, reliable, usable energy. Disruptions in experimental, low-energy tokamaks are generally not an issue. But as fusion machines scale up to grid-scale dimensions, controlling much higher-energy plasmas at all phases will be paramount to maintaining a machine’s safe and efficient operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Uncontrolled plasma terminations, even during rampdown, can generate intense heat fluxes damaging the internal walls,” Wang notes. “Quite often, especially with the high-performance plasmas, rampdowns actually can push the plasma closer to some instability limits. So, it’s a delicate balance. And there’s a lot of focus now on how to manage instabilities so that we can routinely and reliably take these plasmas and safely power them down. And there are relatively few studies done on how to do that well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bringing down the pulse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wang and his colleagues developed a model to predict how a plasma will behave during tokamak rampdown. While they could have simply applied machine-learning tools such as a neural network to learn signs of instabilities in plasma data, “you would need an ungodly amount of data” for such tools to discern the very subtle and ephemeral changes in extremely high-temperature, high-energy plasmas, Wang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the researchers paired a neural network with an existing model that simulates plasma dynamics according to the fundamental rules of physics. With this combination of machine learning and a physics-based plasma simulation, the team found that only a couple hundred pulses at low performance, and a small handful of pulses at high performance, were sufficient to train and validate the new model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data they used for the new study came from the TCV, the Swiss “variable configuration tokamak” operated by the Swiss Plasma Center at EPFL (the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne). The TCV is a small experimental fusion experimental device that is used for research purposes, often as test bed for next-generation device solutions. Wang used the data from several hundred TCV plasma pulses that included properties of the plasma such as its temperature and energies during each pulse’s ramp-up, run, and ramp-down. He trained the new model on this data, then tested it and found it was able to accurately predict the plasma’s evolution given the initial conditions of a particular tokamak run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also developed an algorithm to translate the model’s predictions into practical “trajectories,” or plasma-managing instructions that a tokamak controller can automatically carry out to for instance adjust the magnets or temperature maintain the plasma’s stability. They implemented the algorithm on several TCV runs and found that it produced trajectories that safely ramped down a plasma pulse, in some cases faster and without disruptions compared to runs without the new method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point the plasma will always go away, but we call it a disruption when the plasma goes away at high energy. Here, we ramped the energy down to nothing,” Wang notes. “We did it a number of times. And we did things much better across the board. So,&amp;nbsp;we had statistical confidence that we made things better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported in part by Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), an MIT spinout that intends to build the world’s first compact, grid-scale fusion power plant. The company is developing a demo tokamak, SPARC, designed to produce net-energy plasma, meaning that it should generate more energy than it takes to heat up the plasma. Wang and his colleagues are working with CFS on ways that the new prediction model and tools like it can better predict plasma behavior and prevent costly disruptions to enable safe and reliable fusion power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to tackle the science questions to make fusion routinely useful,” Wang says. “What we’ve done here is the start of what is still a long journey. But I think we’ve made some nice progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional support for the research came from the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, via the Euratom Research and Training Program and funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research, and Innovation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Tokamak-Tuning-01.jpg?itok=9QY6-LY8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT researchers have developed a prediction model that could improve the safety and reliability of tokamak fusion reactors.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/fusion\">Fusion</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/fluid-dynamics\">Fluid dynamics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/plasma-science-and-fusion-center\">Plasma Science and Fusion Center</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/renewable-energy\">Renewable energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-power-and-reactors\">Nuclear power and reactors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Printable aluminum alloy sets strength records, may enable lighter aircraft parts</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/printable-aluminum-alloy-sets-strength-records-may-enable-lighter-aircraft-parts-1007</link>\n  <description>Incorporating machine learning, MIT engineers developed a way to 3D print alloys that are much stronger than conventionally manufactured versions.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 07 Oct 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/printable-aluminum-alloy-sets-strength-records-may-enable-lighter-aircraft-parts-1007</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jennifer Chu | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIT engineers have developed a printable aluminum alloy that can withstand high temperatures and is five times stronger than traditionally manufactured aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new printable metal is made from a mix of aluminum and other elements that the team identified using a combination of simulations and machine learning, which significantly pruned the number of possible combinations of materials to search through. While traditional methods would require simulating over 1 million possible combinations of materials, the team’s new machine learning-based approach needed only to evaluate 40 possible compositions before identifying an ideal mix for a high-strength, printable aluminum alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they printed the alloy and tested the resulting material, the team confirmed that, as predicted, the aluminum alloy was as strong as the strongest aluminum alloys that are manufactured today using traditional casting methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;researchers envision that the new printable aluminum could be made into stronger, more lightweight and temperature-resistant products, such as fan blades in jet engines. Fan blades are traditionally&amp;nbsp;cast from titanium — a material that is more than 50 percent heavier and up to 10 times costlier than aluminum — or made from advanced composites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can use lighter, high-strength material, this would save a considerable amount of energy for the transportation industry,” says&amp;nbsp;Mohadeseh Taheri-Mousavi, who led the work as a postdoc at MIT and is now an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because 3D printing can produce complex geometries, save material, and enable unique designs, we see this printable alloy as something that could also be used in advanced vacuum pumps, high-end automobiles, and cooling devices for data centers,” adds John Hart, the Class of 1922 Professor and head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hart and Taheri-Mousavi provide details on the new printable aluminum design in a &lt;a href=\"https://advanced.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202509507\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Advanced Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The paper’s MIT co-authors include Michael Xu, Clay Houser, Shaolou Wei, James LeBeau, and Greg Olson, along with Florian Hengsbach and Mirko Schaper of Paderborn University in Germany, and Zhaoxuan Ge and Benjamin Glaser of Carnegie Mellon University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Micro-sizing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work grew out of an MIT class that Taheri-Mousavi took in 2020, which was taught by Greg Olson, professor of the practice in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. As part of the class, students learned to use computational simulations to design high-performance alloys. Alloys are materials that are made from a mix of different elements, the combination of which imparts exceptional strength and other unique properties to the material as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olson challenged the class to design an aluminum alloy that would be stronger than the strongest printable aluminum alloy designed to date. As with most materials, the strength of aluminum depends in large part on its microstructure: The smaller and more densely packed its microscopic constituents, or “precipitates,” the stronger the alloy would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the class used computer simulations to methodically combine aluminum with various types and concentrations of elements, to simulate and predict the resulting alloy’s strength. However, the exercise failed to produce a stronger result. At the end of the class, Taheri-Mousavi wondered: Could machine learning do better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, there are a lot of things that contribute nonlinearly to a material’s properties, and you are lost,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “With machine-learning tools, they can point you to where you need to focus, and tell you for example, these two elements are controlling this feature. It lets you explore the design space more efficiently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer by layer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Taheri-Mousavi continued where Olson’s class left off, this time looking to identify a stronger recipe for aluminum alloy. This time, she used machine-learning techniques designed to efficiently comb through data such as the properties of elements, to identify key connections and correlations that should lead to a more desirable outcome or product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She found that, using just 40 compositions mixing aluminum with different elements, their machine-learning approach quickly homed in on a recipe for an aluminum alloy with higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and therefore higher strength, than what the previous studies identified. The alloy’s strength was even higher than what they could identify after simulating over 1 million possibilities without using machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To physically produce this new strong, small-precipitate alloy, the team realized 3D printing would be the way to go instead of traditional metal casting, in which molten liquid aluminum is poured into a mold and is left to cool and harden. The longer this cooling time is, the more likely the individual precipitate is to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that 3D printing, broadly also known as additive manufacturing, can be a faster way to cool and solidify the aluminum alloy. Specifically, they considered laser bed powder fusion (LBPF) — a technique by which a powder is deposited, layer by layer, on a surface in a desired pattern and then quickly melted by a laser that traces over the pattern. The melted pattern is thin enough that it solidfies quickly before another layer is deposited and similarly “printed.” The team found that LBPF’s inherently rapid cooling and solidification enabled the small-precipitate, high-strength aluminum alloy that their machine learning method predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes we have to think about how to get a material to be compatible with 3D printing,” says study co-author John Hart. “Here, 3D printing opens a new door because of the unique characteristics of the process — particularly, the fast cooling rate. Very rapid freezing of the alloy after it’s melted by the laser creates this special set of properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting their idea into practice, the researchers ordered a formulation of printable powder, based on their new aluminum alloy recipe. They sent the powder — a mix of aluminum and five other elements — to collaborators in Germany, who printed small samples of the alloy using their in-house LPBF system. The samples were then sent to MIT where the team ran multiple tests to measure the alloy’s strength and image the samples’ microstructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results confirmed the predictions made by their initial machine learning search: The printed alloy was five times stronger than a casted counterpart and 50 percent stronger than alloys designed using conventional simulations without machine learning. The new alloy’s microstructure also consisted of a higher volume fraction of small precipitates, and was stable at high temperatures of up to 400 degrees Celsius — a very high temperature for aluminum alloys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are applying similar machine-learning techniques to further optimize other properties of the alloy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our methodology opens new doors for anyone who wants to do 3D printing alloy design,” Taheri-Mousavi says. “My dream is that one day, passengers looking out their airplane window will see fan blades of engines made from our aluminum alloys.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work was carried out, in part, using MIT.nano’s characterization facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202510/MIT-Printing-Aluminum-01-press.jpg?itok=WsN06Kug\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new 3-D-printed aluminum alloy is stronger than traditional aluminum, due to a key recipe that, when printed, produces aluminum (illustrated in brown) with nanometer scale precipitates (in light blue).

The broad-spectrum drugs often prescribed for gut flare-ups can kill helpful microbes alongside harmful ones, sometimes worsening symptoms over time. When fighting gut inflammation, you don’t always want to bring a sledgehammer to a knife fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and McMaster University have &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02142-0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;identified a new compound&lt;/a&gt; that takes a more targeted approach. The molecule, called enterololin, suppresses a group of bacteria linked to Crohn’s disease flare-ups while leaving the rest of the microbiome largely intact. Using a generative AI model, the team mapped how the compound works, a process that usually takes years but was accelerated here to just months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This discovery speaks to a central challenge in antibiotic development,” says Jon Stokes, senior author of a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02142-0\"&gt;new paper on the work&lt;/a&gt;, assistant professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at McMaster, and research affiliate at MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health. “The problem isn’t finding molecules that kill bacteria in a dish — we’ve been able to do that for a long time. A major hurdle is figuring out what those molecules actually do inside bacteria. Without that detailed understanding, you can’t develop these early-stage antibiotics into safe and effective therapies for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enterololin is a stride toward precision antibiotics: treatments designed to knock out only the bacteria causing trouble. In mouse models of Crohn’s-like inflammation, the drug zeroed in on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt;, a gut-dwelling bacterium that can worsen flares, while leaving most other microbial residents untouched. Mice given enterololin recovered faster and maintained a healthier microbiome than those treated with vancomycin, a common antibiotic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Pinning down a drug’s mechanism of action, the molecular target it binds inside bacterial cells, normally requires years of painstaking experiments. Stokes’ lab discovered enterololin using a high-throughput screening approach, but determining its target would have been the bottleneck. Here, the team turned to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/speeding-drug-discovery-with-diffusion-generative-models-diffdock-0331\"&gt;DiffDock&lt;/a&gt;, a generative AI model developed at CSAIL by MIT PhD student Gabriele Corso and MIT Professor Regina Barzilay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;DiffDock was designed to predict how small molecules fit into the binding pockets of proteins, a notoriously difficult problem in structural biology. Traditional docking algorithms search through possible orientations using scoring rules, often producing noisy results. DiffDock instead frames docking as a probabilistic reasoning problem: a diffusion model iteratively refines guesses until it converges on the most likely binding mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“In just a couple of minutes, the model predicted that enterololin binds to a protein complex called LolCDE, which is essential for transporting lipoproteins in certain bacteria,” says Barzilay, who also co-leads the Jameel Clinic. “That was a very concrete lead — one that could guide experiments, rather than replace them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Stokes’ group then put that prediction to the test. Using DiffDock predictions as an experimental GPS, they first evolved enterololin-resistant mutants of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; in the lab, which revealed that changes in the mutant’s DNA mapped to lolCDE, precisely where DiffDock had predicted enterololin to bind. They also performed RNA sequencing to see which bacterial genes switched on or off when exposed to the drug, as well as used CRISPR to selectively knock down expression of the expected target. These laboratory experiments all revealed disruptions in pathways tied to lipoprotein transport, exactly what DiffDock had predicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“When you see the computational model and the wet-lab data pointing to the same mechanism, that’s when you start to believe you’ve figured something out,” says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For Barzilay, the project highlights a shift in how AI is used in the life sciences. “A lot of AI use in drug discovery has been about searching chemical space, identifying new molecules that might be active,” she says. “What we’re showing here is that AI can also provide mechanistic explanations, which are critical for moving a molecule through the development pipeline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;That distinction matters because mechanism-of-action studies are often a major rate-limiting step in drug development. Traditional approaches can take 18 months to two years, or more, and cost millions of dollars. In this case, the MIT–McMaster team cut the timeline to about six months, at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enterololin is still in the early stages of development, but translation is already underway. Stokes’ spinout company, Stoked Bio, has licensed the compound and is optimizing its properties for potential human use. Early work is also exploring derivatives of the molecule against other resistant pathogens, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;. If all goes well, clinical trials could begin within the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers also see broader implications. Narrow-spectrum antibiotics have long been sought as a way to treat infections without collateral damage to the microbiome, but they have been difficult to discover and validate. AI tools like DiffDock could make that process more practical, rapidly enabling a new generation of targeted antimicrobials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For patients with Crohn’s and other inflammatory bowel conditions, the prospect of a drug that reduces symptoms without destabilizing the microbiome could mean a meaningful improvement in quality of life. And in the bigger picture, precision antibiotics may help tackle the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“What excites me is not just this compound, but the idea that we can start thinking about the mechanism of action elucidation as something we can do more quickly, with the right combination of AI, human intuition, and laboratory experiments,” says Stokes. “That has the potential to change how we approach drug discovery for many diseases, not just Crohn’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“One of the greatest challenges to our health is the increase of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria that evade even our best antibiotics,” adds Yves Brun, professor at the University of Montreal and distinguished professor emeritus at Indiana University Bloomington, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “AI is becoming an important tool in our fight against these bacteria. This study uses a powerful and elegant combination of AI methods to determine the mechanism of action of a new antibiotic candidate, an important step in its potential development as a therapeutic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corso, Barzilay, and Stokes wrote the paper with McMaster researchers Denise B. Catacutan, Vian Tran, Jeremie Alexander, Yeganeh Yousefi, Megan Tu, Stewart McLellan, and Dominique Tertigas, and professors ​​Jakob Magolan, Michael Surette, Eric Brown, and Brian Coombes.

Bakshi started in the role earlier this month at the start of the school year and will collaborate closely with the managing director, Ethernet Inventors Professor of the Practice Bill Aulet, to elevate the center to higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ana is uniquely qualified for this role through her knowledge and experience in entrepreneurship education at the highest levels, paired with her exceptional leadership and execution skills,” says Aulet. “Ana is committed to creating the highest-quality centers and institutes for entrepreneurs, first at King’s College London, where we met over 10 years ago, and then at Oxford University. This ideal skill set is compounded by her experience in leading high-growth companies, most recently as the chief operation officer in an award-winning AI startup. I’m honored and thrilled to welcome her to MIT — her knowledge and energy will greatly elevate our community, and the field as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rapidly changing environment creates imperative for raising the bar for entrepreneurship education&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to raise the bar for innovation-driven entrepreneurship education is of utmost importance in today's world. The rate of change is getting faster and faster every day, especially with artificial intelligence, and is generating new problems that need to be solved, as well as exacerbating existing problems in climate, health care, manufacturing, future of work, education, and economic stratification, to name but a few. The world needs more entrepreneurs and better entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi joins the Trust Center at a time when MIT is at the forefront of helping to develop people and systems that can turn challenges into opportunities using an entrepreneurial mindset, skill set, and way of operating.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi’s deep experience and success will be key to unlocking this opportunity. “I am honored to be joining MIT and the Trust Center at a time when education and entrepreneurship have the chance to shape the greatest good for the greatest number,” Bakshi says. “In an era defined by both extraordinary challenges and extraordinary possibilities, the future will be built by those bold enough to try, and MIT will be at the forefront of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translating academic research into real-world impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi has built two world-class entrepreneurship centers from the ground up. She served as the founding director at King’s College and then at Oxford. In this role, she was responsible for all aspects of these centers, including fundraising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While at Oxford, she authored a data-driven approach to determining efficacy of outcomes for their programs, as evidenced by a 61-page study, “Universities: Drivers of Prosperity and Economic Recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the director of the Oxford Foundry (Oxford’s cross-university entrepreneurship center), Bakshi focused on investing in ambitious founders and talent. The center was backed by global entrepreneurial leaders such as the founders of LinkedIn and Twitter, with corporate partnerships including Santander and EY, and investment funds including Oxford Science Enterprises (OSE). As of 2021, the startups supported by the Foundry and King’s College have raised over $500 million and have created nearly 3,000 jobs, spanning diverse industries including health tech, climate tech, cybersecurity, fintech, and deep tech spinouts focusing on world-class science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, she built the highly successful and economically sustainable&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sbs.ox.ac.uk/research/centres-and-initiatives/oxford-said-entrepreneurship-centre/e-school\"&gt;Entrepreneurship School&lt;/a&gt;, Oxford’s first digital online learning platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakshi comes to MIT after having worked in the private sector as the chief operating officer (COO) in a rapidly growing artificial intelligence startup for almost two years,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.quench.ai/\"&gt;Quench.ai&lt;/a&gt;, with offices in London and New York City. She was the first C-suite employee at Quench.ai, serving as COO and now senior advisor, helping companies unlock value from their knowledge through AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right place, right time, right person moving at the speed of MIT AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, then turbocharged in the 1940s with the creation and operation of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_Radiation_Laboratory\"&gt;RadLab&lt;/a&gt;, and continuing to this day, entrepreneurship is at the core of MIT’s identity and mission.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"MIT has been a leader in entrepreneurship for decades. It’s now the third leg of the school, alongside teaching and research,” says Mark Gorenberg ’76, chair of the MIT Corporation. “I’m excited to have such a transformative leader as Ana join the Trust Center team, and I look forward to the impact she will have on the students and the wider academic community at MIT as we enter an exciting new phase in company building, driven by the accelerated use of AI and emerging technologies.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a time where we are rethinking management education, entrepreneurship as an interdisciplinary field to create impact is even more important to our future. To have such an experienced and accomplished leader in academia and the startup world, especially in AI, reinforces our commitment to be a global leader in this field,” says Richard M. Locke, John C Head III Dean at the MIT Sloan School of Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“MIT is a unique hub of research, innovation, and entrepreneurship, and that special mix creates massive positive impact that ripples around the world,” says Frederic Kerrest, MIT Sloan MBA ’09, co-founder of Okta, and member of the MIT Corporation. “In a rapidly changing, AI-driven world, Ana has the skills and experience to further accelerate MIT’s global leadership in entrepreneurship education to ensure that our students launch and scale the next generation of groundbreaking, innovation-driven startups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to her time at Oxford and King’s College, Bakshi served as an elected councilor representing 6,000-plus constituents, held roles in international nongovernmental organizations, and led product execution strategy at MAHI, an award-winning family-led craft sauce startup, available in thousands of major retailers across the U.K.&amp;nbsp;Bakshi sits on the&amp;nbsp;advisory council for conservation charity&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://savetheelephants.org/\"&gt;Save the Elephants&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging AI-driven and scientific approaches to reduce human-wildlife conflict and protect elephant populations.&amp;nbsp;Her work and impact have been featured across &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, BBC, &lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;. Bakshi was twice honored as a Top 50 Woman in Tech (U.K.), most recently in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI changes how we learn, how we build, and how we scale, my focus will be on helping MIT expand its support for phenomenal talent — students and faculty — with the skills, ecosystem, and backing to turn knowledge into impact,” Bakshi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35 years of impact to date&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center was founded in 1990 by the late Professor Edward Roberts and serves all MIT students across all schools and all disciplines.&amp;nbsp;It supports 60-plus courses and extensive extracurricular programming, including the delta v academic accelerator. Much of the work of the center is generated through the Disciplined Entrepreneurship methodology, which offers a proven approach to create new ventures. Over a thousand schools and other organizations across the world use Disciplined Entrepreneurship books and resources to teach entrepreneurship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, with AI-powered tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/orbit/\"&gt;Orbit&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/new-ai-jetpack-accelerates-entrepreneurial-process-0919\"&gt;JetPack&lt;/a&gt;, the Trust Center is changing the way that entrepreneurship is taught and practiced. Its mission is to produce the next generation of innovation-driven entrepreneurs while advancing the field more broadly to make it both rigorous and practical. This approach of leveraging proven evidence-based methodology, emerging technology, the ingenuity of MIT students, and responding to industry shifts is similar to how MIT&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cheme.mit.edu/about/history/\"&gt;established the field of chemical engineering in the 1890s&lt;/a&gt;. The desired result in both cases was to create a comprehensive, integrated, scalable, rigorous, and practical curriculum to create a new workforce to address the nation’s and world’s greatest challenges.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-martintrust-bakshi.jpg?itok=GiAfFGg-\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Ana Bakshi is the new executive director of the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Chris Burns</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/leadership\">Leadership</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/staff\">Staff</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/business\">Business and management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/martin-trust-center-mit-entrepreneurship\">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Lincoln Lab unveils the most powerful AI supercomputer at any US university</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/lincoln-lab-unveils-most-powerful-ai-supercomputer-at-any-us-university-1002</link>\n  <description>Optimized for generative AI, TX-GAIN is driving innovation in biodefense, materials discovery, cybersecurity, and other areas of research and development.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 02 Oct 2025 15:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/lincoln-lab-unveils-most-powerful-ai-supercomputer-at-any-us-university-1002</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Kylie Foy | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The new TX-Generative AI Next (TX-GAIN) computing system at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"http://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/cyber-security-and-information-sciences/lincoln-laboratory-supercomputing-center\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center&lt;/a&gt;  (LLSC) is the most powerful AI supercomputer at any U.S. university. With its recent ranking from  &lt;a href=\"https://www.top500.org/lists/top500/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;TOP500&lt;/a&gt;, which biannually publishes a list of the top supercomputers in various categories, TX-GAIN joins the ranks of other powerful systems at the LLSC, all supporting research and development at Lincoln Laboratory and across the MIT campus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"TX-GAIN will enable our researchers to achieve scientific and engineering breakthroughs. The system will play a large role in supporting generative AI, physical simulation, and data analysis across all research areas,\" says Lincoln Laboratory Fellow&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Jeremy Kepner&lt;/a&gt;, who heads the LLSC.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC is a key resource for accelerating innovation at Lincoln Laboratory. Thousands of researchers tap into the LLSC to analyze data, train models, and run simulations for federally funded research projects. The supercomputers have been used, for example,&amp;nbsp;to simulate billions of aircraft encounters to develop collision-avoidance systems for the Federal Aviation Administration, and to train models in the complex tasks of autonomous navigation for the Department of Defense. Over the years, LLSC capabilities have been essential to numerous&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.mit.edu/~kepner/#AwardsEnabled\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;award-winning technologies&lt;/a&gt;, including those that have improved  airline safety,  prevented the spread of new diseases, and  aided in hurricane responses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, TX-GAIN is especially equipped for developing and applying generative AI. Whereas traditional AI focuses on categorization tasks, like identifying whether a photo depicts a dog or cat, generative AI produces entirely new outputs. Kepner describes it as a mathematical combination of interpolation (filling in the gaps between known data points) and extrapolation (extending data beyond known points). Today, generative AI is widely known for its use of large language models to create human-like responses to user prompts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lincoln Laboratory, teams are applying generative AI to various domains beyond large language models. They are using the technology, for instance, to evaluate radar signatures, supplement weather data where coverage is missing, root out anomalies in network traffic, and explore chemical interactions to design new medicines and materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enable such intense computations, TX-GAIN is powered by more than 600 NVIDIA graphics processing unit accelerators specially designed for AI operations, in addition to traditional high-performance computing hardware. With a peak performance of two AI exaflops (two quintillion floating-point operations per second), TX-GAIN is the top AI system at a university, and in the Northeast.&amp;nbsp;Since TX-GAIN came online this summer, researchers have taken notice.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"TX-GAIN is allowing us to model not only significantly more protein interactions than ever before, but also much larger proteins with more atoms. This new computational capability is a game-changer for protein characterization efforts in biological defense,\" says Rafael Jaimes, a researcher in Lincoln Laboratory's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/counter-weapons-mass-destruction-systems\"&gt;Counter–Weapons of Mass Destruction Systems Group&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC's focus on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/impact/world-leader-interactive-supercomputing\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;interactive supercomputing&lt;/a&gt; makes it especially useful to researchers. For years, the LLSC has pioneered software that lets users access its powerful systems without needing to be experts in configuring algorithms for parallel processing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The LLSC has always tried to make supercomputing feel like working on your laptop,\" Kepner says. \"The amount of data and the sophistication of analysis methods needed to be competitive today are well beyond what can be done on a laptop. But with our user-friendly approach, people can run their model and get answers quickly from their workspace.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond supporting programs solely at Lincoln Laboratory, TX-GAIN is enhancing research collaborations with MIT's campus. Such collaborations include the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.haystack.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Haystack Observatory&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cqe.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Center for Quantum Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Beaver Works&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://aia.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Department of Air Force–MIT AI Accelerator.&lt;/a&gt; The latter initiative is rapidly prototyping, scaling, and applying AI technologies for the U.S. Air Force and Space Force,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/us-air-force-pilots-artificial-intelligence-assist-scheduling-aircrews-0708\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;optimizing flight scheduling&lt;/a&gt; for global operations as one fielded example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LLSC systems are housed in an energy-efficient data center and facility in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Research staff in the LLSC are also tackling the immense&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/qa-vijay-gadepally-climate-impact-generative-ai\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;energy needs of AI&lt;/a&gt; and leading research into various&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/ai-models-are-devouring-energy-tools-reduce-consumption-are-here-if-data-centers-will-adopt\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;power-reduction methods&lt;/a&gt;. One software tool they developed can reduce the energy of training an AI model by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3581784.3607034\"&gt;as much as 80 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"The LLSC provides the capabilities needed to do leading-edge research, while in a cost-effective and energy-efficient manner,\" Kepner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the supercomputers at the LLSC use the \"TX\" nomenclature in homage&amp;nbsp;to Lincoln Laboratory's Transistorized Experimental Computer Zero (TX-0) of 1956. TX-0 was one of the world's first transistor-based machines, and its 1958 successor,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/sites/default/files/page/doc/2018-05/LookingBack_19_1.pdf\"&gt;TX-2&lt;/a&gt;, is storied for its role in pioneering human-computer interaction and AI.

While not all operations performed in a data center are AI-related, this total amount is slightly more than the energy consumption of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, an August 2025 analysis from Goldman Sachs Research forecasts that about 60 percent of the increasing electricity demands from data centers will be met by burning fossil fuels, increasing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-ai-is-transforming-data-centers-and-ramping-up-power-demand\"&gt;global carbon emissions by about 220 million tons&lt;/a&gt;. In comparison, driving a gas-powered car for 5,000 miles produces about 1 ton of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These statistics are staggering, but at the same time, scientists and engineers at MIT and around the world are studying innovations and interventions to mitigate AI’s ballooning carbon footprint, from boosting the efficiency of algorithms to rethinking the design of data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considering carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk of reducing generative AI’s carbon footprint is typically centered on “operational carbon” — the emissions used by the powerful processors, known as GPUs, inside a data center. It often ignores “embodied carbon,” which are emissions created by building the data center in the first place, says Vijay Gadepally, senior scientist at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who leads research projects in the Lincoln Laboratory Supercomputing Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constructing and retrofitting a data center, built from tons of steel and concrete and filled with air conditioning units, computing hardware, and miles of cable, consumes a huge amount of carbon. In fact, the environmental impact of building data centers is one reason companies like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.constructiondive.com/news/meta-piloting-mass-timber-for-sustainable-data-center-construction-clt-green-building/756919/\"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.esgdive.com/news/microsoft-swaps-concrete-steel-with-wood-in-data-centers-to-cut-emissions/731912/\"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are exploring more sustainable building materials. (Cost is another factor.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, data centers are enormous buildings — the world’s largest, the China Telecomm-Inner Mongolia Information Park, engulfs&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://datacentremagazine.com/top10/top-10-biggest-data-centres\"&gt;roughly 10 million square feet&lt;/a&gt; — with about 10 to 50 times the energy density of a normal office building, Gadepally adds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The operational side is only part of the story. Some things we are working on to reduce operational emissions may lend themselves to reducing embodied carbon, too, but we need to do more on that front in the future,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing operational carbon emissions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to reducing operational carbon emissions of AI data centers, there are many parallels with home energy-saving measures. For one, we can simply turn down the lights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if you have the worst lightbulbs in your house from an efficiency standpoint, turning them off or dimming them will always use less energy than leaving them running at full blast,” Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same fashion, research from the Supercomputing Center has shown that “turning down” the GPUs in a data center so they consume about &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/qa-vijay-gadepally-climate-impact-generative-ai-0113\"&gt;three-tenths the energy&lt;/a&gt; has minimal impacts on the performance of AI models, while also making the hardware easier to cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another strategy is to use less energy-intensive computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demanding generative AI workloads, such as training new reasoning models like GPT-5, usually need many GPUs working simultaneously. The Goldman Sachs analysis estimates that a state-of-the-art system could soon have as many as 576 connected GPUs operating at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But engineers can sometimes achieve similar results by reducing the precision of computing hardware, perhaps by switching to less powerful processors that have been tuned to handle a specific AI workload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also measures that boost the efficiency of training power-hungry deep-learning models before they are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gadepally’s group found that about half the electricity used for training an AI model is spent to get the last 2 or 3 percentage points in accuracy. Stopping the training process early can save a lot of that energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There might be cases where 70 percent accuracy is good enough for one particular application, like a recommender system for e-commerce,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also take advantage of efficiency-boosting measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a postdoc in the Supercomputing Center realized the group might run a thousand simulations during the training process to pick the two or three best AI models for their project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By building a tool that allowed them to avoid about 80 percent of those wasted computing cycles, they dramatically reduced the energy demands of training with no reduction in model accuracy, Gadepally says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leveraging efficiency improvements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Constant innovation in computing hardware, such as denser arrays of transistors on semiconductor chips, is still enabling dramatic improvements in the energy efficiency of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though energy efficiency improvements have been slowing for most chips since about 2005, the amount of computation that GPUs can do per joule of energy has been improving by 50 to 60 percent each year, says Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech Research Project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a principal investigator at MIT’s Initiative on the Digital Economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The still-ongoing ‘Moore’s Law’ trend of getting more and more transistors on chip still matters for a lot of these AI systems, since running operations in parallel is still very valuable for improving efficiency,” says Thomspon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more significant, his group’s research indicates that efficiency gains from new model architectures that can solve complex problems faster, consuming less energy to achieve the same or better results, is doubling every eight or nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thompson coined the term “&lt;a href=\"https://ide.mit.edu/insights/the-importance-of-aigorithm-efficiency-can-nflops-hold-the-key-to-efficiency-gains/\"&gt;negaflop&lt;/a&gt;” to describe this effect. The same way a “negawatt” represents electricity saved due to energy-saving measures, a “negaflop” is a computing operation that doesn’t need to be performed due to algorithmic improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could be things like “&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/new-techniques-efficiently-accelerate-sparse-tensors-1030\"&gt;pruning&lt;/a&gt;” away unnecessary components of a neural network or employing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2022/machine-learning-edge-microcontroller-1004\"&gt;compression techniques&lt;/a&gt; that enable users to do more with less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you need to use a really powerful model today to complete your task, in just a few years, you might be able to use a significantly smaller model to do the same thing, which would carry much less environmental burden. Making these models more efficient is the single-most important thing you can do to reduce the environmental costs of AI,” Thompson says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximizing energy savings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While reducing the overall energy use of AI algorithms and computing hardware will cut greenhouse gas emissions, not all energy is the same, Gadepally adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amount of carbon emissions in 1 kilowatt hour varies quite significantly, even just during the day, as well as over the month and year,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers can take advantage of these variations by leveraging the flexibility of AI workloads and data center operations to maximize emissions reductions. For instance, some generative AI workloads don’t need to be performed in their entirety at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Splitting computing operations so some are performed later, when more of the electricity fed into the grid is from renewable sources like solar and wind, can go a long way toward reducing a data center’s carbon footprint, says Deepjyoti Deka, a research scientist in the MIT Energy Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deka and his team are also studying “smarter” data centers where the AI workloads of multiple companies using the same computing equipment are flexibly adjusted to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By looking at the system as a whole, our hope is to minimize energy use as well as dependence on fossil fuels, while still maintaining reliability standards for AI companies and users,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and others at MITEI are building a flexibility model of a data center that considers the differing energy demands of training a deep-learning model versus deploying that model. Their hope is to uncover the best strategies for scheduling and streamlining computing operations to improve energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers are also exploring the use of long-duration energy storage units at data centers, which store excess energy for times when it is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these systems in place, a data center could use stored energy that was generated by renewable sources during a high-demand period, or avoid the use of diesel backup generators if there are fluctuations in the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long-duration energy storage could be a game-changer here because we can design operations that really change the emission mix of the system to rely more on renewable energy,” Deka says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, researchers at MIT and Princeton University are developing a software tool for investment planning in the power sector, called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://energy.mit.edu/genx/\"&gt;GenX&lt;/a&gt;, which could be used to help companies determine the ideal place to locate a data center to minimize environmental impacts and costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Location can have a big impact on reducing a data center’s carbon footprint. For instance, Meta operates a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://datacenters.atmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Meta_s-Lulea-Data-Center.pdf\"&gt;data center in Lulea&lt;/a&gt;, a city on the coast of northern Sweden where cooler temperatures reduce the amount of electricity needed to cool computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking farther outside the box (way farther), some governments are even exploring the construction of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-center-on-the-moon\"&gt;data centers on the moon&lt;/a&gt; where they could potentially be operated with nearly all renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-based solutions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, the expansion of renewable energy generation here on Earth isn’t keeping pace with the rapid growth of AI, which is one major roadblock to reducing its carbon footprint, says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, a short-term lecturer, former Sloan Fellow, and former practice leader of climate and energy AI at the Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The local, state, and federal review processes required for a new renewable energy projects can take years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at MIT and elsewhere are exploring the use of AI to speed up the process of connecting new renewable energy systems to the power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a generative AI model could streamline interconnection studies that determine how a new project will impact the power grid, a step that often takes years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when it comes to &lt;a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3485128\"&gt;accelerating the development and implementation of clean energy technologies&lt;/a&gt;, AI could play a major role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Machine learning is great for tackling complex situations, and the electrical grid is said to be one of the largest and most complex machines in the world,” Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, AI could help optimize the prediction of solar and wind energy generation or identify ideal locations for new facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could also be used to perform predictive maintenance and fault detection for solar panels or other green energy infrastructure, or to monitor the capacity of transmission wires to maximize efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By helping researchers gather and analyze huge amounts of data, AI could also inform targeted policy interventions aimed at getting the biggest “bang for the buck” from areas such as renewable energy, Turliuk says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of AI systems, she and her collaborators developed the Net Climate Impact Score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The score is a framework that can be used to help determine the net climate impact of AI projects, considering emissions and other environmental costs along with potential environmental benefits in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, the most effective solutions will likely result from collaborations among companies, regulators, and researchers, with academia leading the way, Turliuk adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every day counts. We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT_AI-Climate-01.jpg?itok=--5jq5Ns\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“We are on a path where the effects of climate change won’t be fully known until it is too late to do anything about it,” says Jennifer Turliuk MBA ’25, who is working to help policymakers, scientists, and enterprises consider the multifaceted costs and benefits of generative AI. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to innovate and make AI systems less carbon-intense.”</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainable-computing\">Sustainable computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/supercomputing\">Supercomputing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy-storage\">Energy storage</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/infrastructure\">Infrastructure</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-energy-initiative\">MIT Energy Initiative</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lincoln-laboratory-0\">Lincoln Laboratory</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>AI system learns from many types of scientific information and runs experiments to discover new materials</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-system-learns-many-types-scientific-information-and-runs-experiments-discovering-new-materials-0925</link>\n  <description>The new “CRESt” platform could help find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-system-learns-many-types-scientific-information-and-runs-experiments-discovering-new-materials-0925</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine-learning models can speed up the discovery of new materials by making predictions and suggesting experiments. But most models today only consider a few specific types of data or variables. Compare that with human scientists, who work in a collaborative environment and consider experimental results, the broader scientific literature, imaging and structural analysis, personal experience or intuition, and input from colleagues and peer reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a method for optimizing materials recipes and planning experiments that incorporates information from diverse sources like insights from the literature, chemical compositions, microstructural images, and more. The approach is part of a new platform, named Copilot for Real-world Experimental Scientists (CRESt), that also uses robotic equipment for high-throughput materials testing, the results of which are fed back into large multimodal models to further optimize materials recipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human researchers can converse with the system in natural language, with no coding required, and the system makes its own observations and hypotheses along the way. Cameras and visual language models also allow the system to monitor experiments, detect issues, and suggest corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the field of AI for science, the key is designing new experiments,” says Ju Li, School of Engineering Carl Richard Soderberg Professor of Power Engineering. “We use multimodal feedback — for example information from previous literature on how palladium behaved in fuel cells at this temperature, and human feedback — to complement experimental data and design new experiments. We also use robots to synthesize and characterize the material’s structure and to test performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system is described in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09640-5\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers used CRESt to explore more than 900 chemistries and conduct 3,500 electrochemical tests, leading to the discovery of a catalyst material that delivered record power density in a fuel cell that runs on formate salt to produce electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining Li on the paper as first authors are&amp;nbsp;PhD student Zhen Zhang, Zhichu Ren PhD ’24, PhD student Chia-Wei Hsu, and postdoc&amp;nbsp;Weibin Chen. Their coauthors are MIT Assistant Professor Iwnetim Abate; Associate Professor Pulkit Agrawal; JR East Professor of Engineering Yang Shao-Horn; MIT.nano researcher Aubrey Penn; Zhang-Wei Hong PhD ’25, Hongbin Xu PhD ’25; Daniel Zheng PhD ’25; MIT graduate students Shuhan Miao and Hugh Smith; MIT postdocs Yimeng Huang, Weiyin Chen, Yungsheng Tian, Yifan Gao, and Yaoshen Niu; former MIT postdoc Sipei Li; and collaborators including Chi-Feng Lee, Yu-Cheng Shao, Hsiao-Tsu Wang, and Ying-Rui Lu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A smarter system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can be time-consuming and expensive. They require researchers to carefully design workflows, make new material, and run a series of tests and analysis to understand what happened. Those results are then used to decide how to improve the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve the process, some researchers have turned to a machine-learning strategy known as active learning to make efficient use of previous experimental data points and explore or exploit those data. When paired with a statistical technique known as Bayesian optimization (BO), active learning has helped researchers identify new materials for things like batteries and advanced semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bayesian optimization is like Netflix recommending the next movie to watch based on your viewing history, except instead it recommends the next experiment to do,” Li explains. “But basic Bayesian optimization is too simplistic. It uses a boxed-in design space, so if I say I’m going to use platinum, palladium, and iron, it only changes the ratio of those elements in this small space. But real materials have a lot more dependencies, and BO often gets lost.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most active learning approaches also rely on single data streams that don’t capture everything that goes on in an experiment. To equip computational systems with more human-like knowledge, while still taking advantage of the speed and control of automated systems, Li and his collaborators built CRESt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRESt’s robotic equipment includes a liquid-handling robot, a carbothermal shock system to rapidly synthesize materials, an automated electrochemical workstation for testing, characterization equipment including automated electron microscopy and optical microscopy, and auxiliary devices such as pumps and gas valves, which can also be remotely controlled.&amp;nbsp; Many processing parameters can also be tuned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the user interface, researchers can chat with CRESt and tell it to use active learning to find promising materials recipes for different projects. CRESt can include up to 20 precursor molecules and substrates into its recipe. To guide material designs, CRESt’s models search through scientific papers for descriptions of elements or precursor molecules that might be useful. When human researchers tell CRESt to pursue new recipes, it kicks off a robotic symphony of sample preparation, characterization, and testing. The researcher can also ask CRESt to perform image analysis from scanning electron microscopy imaging, X-ray diffraction, and other sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information from those processes is used to train the active learning models, which use both literature knowledge and current experimental results to suggest further experiments and accelerate materials discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For each recipe we use previous literature text or databases, and it creates these huge representations of every recipe based on the previous knowledge base before even doing the experiment,” says Li. “We perform principal component analysis in this knowledge embedding space to get a reduced search space that captures most of the performance variability. Then we use Bayesian optimization in this reduced space to design the new experiment. After the new experiment, we feed newly acquired multimodal experimental data and human feedback into a large language model to augment the knowledgebase and redefine the reduced search space, which gives us a big boost in active learning efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials science experiments can also face reproducibility challenges. To address the problem, CRESt monitors its experiments with cameras, looking for potential problems and suggesting solutions via text and voice to human researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used CRESt to develop an electrode material for an advanced type of high-density fuel cell known as a direct formate fuel cell. After exploring more than 900 chemistries over three months, CRESt discovered a catalyst material made from eight elements that achieved a 9.3-fold improvement in power density per dollar over pure palladium, an expensive precious metal. In further tests, CRESTs material was used to deliver a record power density to a working direct formate fuel cell even though the cell contained just one-fourth of the precious metals of previous devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show the potential for CRESt to find solutions to real-world energy problems that have plagued the materials science and engineering community for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A significant challenge for fuel-cell catalysts is the use of precious metal,” says Zhang. “For fuel cells, researchers have used various precious metals like palladium and platinum. We used a multielement catalyst that also incorporates many other cheap elements to create the optimal coordination environment for catalytic activity and resistance to poisoning species such as carbon monoxide and adsorbed hydrogen atom. People have been searching low-cost options for many years. This system greatly accelerated our search for these catalysts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A helpful assistant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on, poor reproducibility emerged as a major problem that limited the researchers’ ability to perform their new active learning technique on experimental datasets. Material properties can be influenced by the way the precursors are mixed and processed, and any number of problems can subtly alter experimental conditions, requiring careful inspection to correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To partially automate the process, the researchers coupled computer vision and vision language models with domain knowledge from the scientific literature, which allowed the system to hypothesize sources of irreproducibility and propose solutions. For example, the models can notice when there’s a millimeter-sized deviation in a sample’s shape or when a pipette moves something out of place. The researchers incorporated some of the model’s suggestions, leading to improved consistency, suggesting the models already make good experimental assistants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers noted that humans still performed most of the debugging in their experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CREST is an assistant, not a replacement, for human researchers,” Li says. “Human researchers are still indispensable. In fact, we use natural language so the system can explain what it is doing and present observations and hypotheses. But this is a step toward more flexible, self-driving labs.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Crest-01-press.jpg?itok=7kYJbO5h\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The CRESt user interface allows researchers to chat with the platform and tell it to deliver promising material recipes, start sample preparation, or perform image analysis on SEM images.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; figures courtesy of the researchers; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/materialsscienceandengineering\">Materials science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nanotech\">Nanoscience and nanotechnology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dmse\">DMSE</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitnano\">MIT.nano</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New AI system could accelerate clinical research</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925</link>\n  <description>By enabling rapid annotation of areas of interest in medical images, the tool can help scientists study new treatments or map disease progression.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 25 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-ai-system-could-accelerate-clinical-research-0925</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Annotating regions of interest in medical images, a process known as segmentation, is often one of the first steps clinical researchers take when running a new study involving biomedical images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, to determine how the size of the brain’s hippocampus changes as patients age, the scientist first outlines each hippocampus in a series of brain scans. For many structures and image types, this is often a manual process that can be extremely time-consuming, especially if the regions being studied are challenging to delineate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To streamline the process, MIT researchers developed an artificial intelligence-based system that enables a researcher to rapidly segment new biomedical imaging datasets by clicking, scribbling, and drawing boxes on the images. This new AI model uses these interactions to predict the segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the user marks additional images, the number of interactions they need to perform decreases, eventually dropping to zero. The model can then segment each new image accurately without user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can do this because the model’s architecture has been specially designed to use information from images it has already segmented to make new predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike other medical image segmentation models, this system allows the user to segment an entire dataset without repeating their work for each image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the interactive tool does not require a presegmented image dataset for training, so users don’t need machine-learning expertise or extensive computational resources. They can use the system for a new segmentation task without retraining the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long run, this tool could accelerate studies of new treatment methods and reduce the cost of clinical trials and medical research. It could also be used by physicians to improve the efficiency of clinical applications, such as radiation treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many scientists might only have time to segment a few images per day for their research because manual image segmentation is so time-consuming. Our hope is that this system will enable new science by allowing clinical researchers to conduct studies they were prohibited from doing before because of the lack of an efficient tool,” says Hallee Wong, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student and lead author of a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.15058\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper on this new tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz PhD ’24; John Guttag, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering; and senior author Adrian Dalca, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and MGH, and a research scientist in the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). The research will be presented at the International Conference on Computer Vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlining segmentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are primarily two methods researchers use to segment new sets of medical images. With interactive segmentation, they input an image into an AI system and use an interface to mark areas of interest. The model predicts the segmentation based on those interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tool previously developed by the MIT researchers,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/scribbleprompt-helping-doctors-annotate-medical-scans-0909\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;ScribblePrompt&lt;/a&gt;, allows users to do this, but they must repeat the process for each new image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another approach is to develop a task-specific AI model to automatically segment the images. This approach requires the user to manually segment hundreds of images to create a dataset, and then train a machine-learning model. That model predicts the segmentation for a new image. But the user must start the complex, machine-learning-based process from scratch for each new task, and there is no way to correct the model if it makes a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new system,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://multiverseg.csail.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;MultiverSeg&lt;/a&gt;, combines the best of each approach. It predicts a segmentation for a new image based on user interactions, like scribbles, but also keeps each segmented image in a context set that it refers to later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the user uploads a new image and marks areas of interest, the model draws on the examples in its context set to make a more accurate prediction, with less user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed the model’s architecture to use a context set of any size, so&amp;nbsp;the user doesn’t need to have a certain number of images. This gives MultiverSeg the flexibility to be used in a range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point, for many tasks, you shouldn’t need to provide any interactions. If you have enough examples in the context set, the model can accurately predict the segmentation on its own,” Wong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers carefully engineered and trained the model on a diverse collection of biomedical imaging data to ensure it had the ability to incrementally improve its predictions based on user input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user doesn’t need to retrain or customize the model for their data. To use MultiverSeg for a new task, one can upload a new medical image and start marking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers compared MultiverSeg to state-of-the-art tools for in-context and interactive image segmentation, it outperformed each baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer clicks, better results&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike these other tools, MultiverSeg requires less user input with each image. By the ninth new image, it needed only two clicks from the user to generate a segmentation more accurate than a model designed specifically for the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some image types, like X-rays, the user might only need to segment one or two images manually before the model becomes accurate enough to make predictions on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tool’s interactivity also enables the user to make corrections to the model’s prediction, iterating until it reaches the desired level of accuracy. Compared to the researchers’ previous system, MultiverSeg reached 90 percent accuracy with roughly 2/3 the number of scribbles and 3/4 the number of clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With MultiverSeg, users can always provide more interactions to refine the AI predictions. This still dramatically accelerates the process because it is usually faster to correct something that exists than to start from scratch,” Wong says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving forward, the researchers want to test this tool in real-world situations with clinical collaborators and improve it based on user feedback. They also want to enable MultiverSeg to segment 3D biomedical images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is supported, in part, by Quanta Computer, Inc. and the National Institutes of Health, with hardware support from the Massachusetts Life Sciences Center.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Scalable-Segmentation-01.jpg?itok=JP7l2Ede\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT researchers have developed a new AI-based tool that rapidly annotates areas of interest in medical images and can help in the study of new treatments or map disease progression.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/imaging\">Imaging</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health-care\">Health care</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Improving the workplace of the future</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/improving-workplace-future-whitney-zhang-0924</link>\n  <description>Economics doctoral student Whitney Zhang investigates how technologies and organizational decisions shape labor markets.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 24 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/improving-workplace-future-whitney-zhang-0924</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Benjamin Daniel | School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Whitney Zhang ’21 believes in the importance of valuing workers regardless of where they fit into an organizational chart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang is a PhD student in MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/\"&gt;Department of Economics&lt;/a&gt; studying labor economics. She explores how the technological and managerial decisions companies make affect workers across the pay spectrum.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“I’ve been interested in economics, economic impacts, and related social issues for a long time,” says Zhang, who majored in mathematical economics as an undergraduate. “I wanted to apply my math skills to see how we could improve policies and their effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang is interested in how to improve conditions for workers. She believes it’s important to build relationships with policymakers, focusing on an evidence-driven approach to policy, while always remembering to center those the policies may affect. “We have to remember the people whose lives are impacted by business operations and legislation,” she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;She’s also aware of the complex intermixture of politics, social status, and financial obligations organizations and their employees have to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Though I’m studying workers, it’s important to consider the entire complex ecosystem when solving for these kinds of challenges, including firm incentives and global economic conditions,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The intersection of tech and labor policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang began investigating employee productivity, artificial intelligence, and related economic and labor market phenomena early in her time as a doctoral student, collaborating frequently with fellow PhD students in the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;A collaboration with economics doctoral student Shakked Noy yielded the 2023&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh2586\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; investigating ChatGPT as a tool to improve productivity. Their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/study-finds-chatgpt-boosts-worker-productivity-writing-0714\"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found it substantially increased workers’ productivity on writing tasks, most so for workers who initially performed the worst on the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This was one of the earliest pieces of evidence on the productivity effects of generative AI, and contributed to providing concrete data on how impactful these types of tools might be in the workplace and on the labor market,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In other ongoing research&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;“Determinants of Irregular Worker Schedules” —&amp;nbsp;Zhang is using data from a payroll provider to examine scheduling unpredictability, investigating why companies employ unpredictable schedules and how these schedules affect low-wage employees’ quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The scheduling project, conducted with MIT economics PhD student Nathan Lazarus, is motivated, in part, by existing sociological evidence that low-wage workers’ unpredictable schedules are associated with worse sleep and well-being. “We’ve seen a relationship between higher turnover and inconsistent, inadequate schedules, which suggests workers dis-prefer these kinds of schedules,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;At an academic roundtable, Zhang presented her results to Starbucks employees involved in scheduling and staffing. The attendees wanted to learn more about how different scheduling practices impacted workers and their productivity. “These are the kinds of questions that could reveal useful information for small businesses, large corporations, and others,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;By conducting this research, Zhang hopes to better understand whether or not scheduling regulations can improve affected employees’ quality of life, while also considering potential unintended consequences. “Why are these schedules set the way they’re set?” she asks. “Do businesses with these kinds of schedules require increased regulation?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Another project, conducted with MIT economics doctoral student Arjun Ramani, examines the linkages between offshoring, remote work, and related outcomes. “Do the technological and managerial practices that have made remote work possible further facilitate offshoring?” she asks. “Do organizations see significant gains in efficiency? What are the impacts on U.S. and offshore workers?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Her work is being funded through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program\"&gt;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program&lt;/a&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://equitablegrowth.org/equitable-growth-awards-funding-to-early-career-scholars-studying-the-effects-of-economic-inequality/\"&gt;Washington Center for Equitable Growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting people at the center&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang has observed the different kinds of people economics and higher education could bring together. She followed a dual enrollment track in high school, completing college-level courses with students from across a variety of demographic identities. “I enjoyed centering people in my work,” she says. “Taking classes with a diverse group of students, including veterans and mothers returning to school to complete their studies, made me more curious about socioeconomic issues and the policies relevant to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;She later enrolled at MIT, where she participated in the Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (&lt;a href=\"https://urop.mit.edu/\"&gt;UROP&lt;/a&gt;). She also completed an internship at the World Bank, worked as a summer analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and worked as an assistant for a diverse faculty cohort including MIT economists&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/david-h-autor\"&gt;David Autor&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/jonathan-gruber\"&gt;Jon Gruber&lt;/a&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/people/faculty/nina-roussille\"&gt;Nina Roussille&lt;/a&gt;. Autor is her primary advisor on her doctoral research, a mentor she cites as a significant influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“[Autor’s] course, 14.03 (Microeconomics and Public Policy), cemented connections between theory and practice,” she says. “I thought the class was revelatory in showing the kinds of questions economics can answer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Doctoral study has revealed interesting pathways of investigation for Zhang, as have her relationships with her student peers and other faculty. She has, for example, leveraged faculty connections to gain access to hourly wage data in support of her scheduling and employee impacts work. “Generally, economists have had administrative data on earnings, but not on hours,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang’s focus on improving others’ lives extends to her work outside the classroom. She’s a mentor for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bcnc.net/find-a-program/child-and-youth-services/youth-program/\"&gt;Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center College Access Program&lt;/a&gt; and a member of MIT’s Graduate Christian Fellowship group. When she’s not enjoying spicy soups or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://harvarddb.com/\"&gt;paddling&lt;/a&gt; on the Charles, she takes advantage of opportunities to decompress with her art at&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://arts.mit.edu/start/studios/\"&gt;W20 Arts Studios&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“I wanted to create time for myself outside of research and the classroom,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Zhang cites the benefits of MIT’s focus on cross-collaboration and encouraging students to explore other disciplines. As an undergraduate, Zhang minored in computer science, which taught her coding skills critical to her data work. Exposure to engineering also led her to become more interested in questions around how technology and workers interact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Working with other scholars in the department has improved how Zhang conducts inquiries. “I’ve become the kind of well-rounded student and professional who can identify and quantify impacts, which is invaluable for future projects,” she says. Exposure to different academic and research areas, Zhang argues, helps increase access to ideas and information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-Whitney-Zhang.jpg?itok=2XIoq8ag\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“I’ve been interested in economics, economic impacts, and related social issues for a long time,” says Whitney Zhang.

With AI technologies such as large language models (LLMs), the barrier to entry for these formal tools is dropping rapidly, making formal verification frameworks accessible to working mathematicians.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathlib is a large, community-driven mathematical library for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" title=\"https://lean-lang.org/\" data-outlook-id=\"aec284c5-6738-43e8-a293-7ec08de2a2e8\"&gt;Lean&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;theorem prover, a formal system that verifies the correctness of every step in a proof.&amp;nbsp;Mathlib currently contains on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; mathematical results (such as lemmas, propositions, and theorems). The LMFDB,&amp;nbsp;a massive, collaborative online resource that serves as a kind of “encyclopedia” of modern number theory,&amp;nbsp;contains more than 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; concrete statements.&amp;nbsp;Sutherland&amp;nbsp;and Roe are managing editors of the LMFDB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roe and Sutherland’s grant will be used for a&amp;nbsp;project that aims to augment both systems, making the LMFDB’s results available within mathlib as assertions that have not yet been formally proved, and providing precise formal definitions of the numerical data stored within the LMFDB. This bridge will benefit both human mathematicians and AI agents, and provide a framework for connecting other mathematical databases to formal theorem-proving systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main obstacles to automating mathematical discovery and proof are the limited amount of formalized math knowledge, the high cost of formalizing complex results, and the gap between what is computationally accessible and what is feasible to formalize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address these obstacles, the researchers will use the funding to build tools for accessing the LMFDB from mathlib, making a large database of unformalized mathematical knowledge accessible to a formal proof system. This approach enables proof assistants to identify specific targets for formalization without the need to formalize the entire LMFDB corpus in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making a large database of unformalized number-theoretic facts available within mathlib will provide a powerful technique for mathematical discovery, because the set of facts an agent might wish to consider while searching for a theorem or proof is exponentially larger than the set of facts that eventually need to be formalized in actually proving the theorem,” says Roe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that proving new theorems at the frontier of mathematical knowledge often&amp;nbsp;involves steps that rely on a nontrivial computation. For example, Andrew Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem uses what is known as the “3-5 trick” at a crucial point in the proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This trick depends on the fact that the modular curve X_0(15) has only finitely many rational points, and none of those rational points correspond to a semi-stable elliptic curve,” according to&amp;nbsp;Sutherland. “This fact was known well before Wiles’ work, and is easy to verify using computational tools available in modern computer algebra systems, but it is not something one can realistically prove using pencil and paper, nor is it necessarily easy to formalize.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While formal theorem provers are being connected to computer algebra systems for more efficient verification, tapping into computational outputs in existing mathematical databases offers several other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using stored results leverages the thousands of CPU-years of computation time already spent in creating the LMFDB, saving money that would be needed to redo these computations. Having precomputed information available also makes it feasible to search for examples or counterexamples without knowing ahead of time how broad the search can be. In addition, mathematical databases are curated repositories, not simply a random collection of facts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that number theorists emphasized the role of the conductor in databases of elliptic curves has already proved to be crucial to one notable mathematical discovery made using machine learning tools:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/\" title=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/elliptic-curve-murmurations-found-with-ai-take-flight-20240305/\" data-outlook-id=\"05d200f2-ffa0-4277-92e5-3fcf85b00cb9\"&gt;murmurations&lt;/a&gt;,” says&amp;nbsp;Sutherland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our next steps are to build a team, engage with both the LMFDB and mathlib communities, start to formalize the definitions that underpin the elliptic curve, number field, and modular form sections of the LMFDB, and make it possible to run LMFDB searches from within mathlib,” says Roe. “If you are an MIT student interested in getting involved, feel free to reach out!”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/mit-mathematics-roe-sutherland.jpg?itok=GaIs7BPh\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Department of Mathematics researchers David Roe (left) and Andrew Sutherland</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Sandi Miller</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/awards\">Awards, honors and fellowships</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/funding\">Funding</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/staff\">Staff</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New tool makes generative AI models more likely to create breakthrough materials</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922</link>\n  <description>With SCIGEN, researchers can steer AI models to create materials with exotic properties for applications like quantum computing.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 22 Sep 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-tool-makes-generative-ai-models-likely-create-breakthrough-materials-0922</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The artificial intelligence models that turn text into images are also useful for generating new materials. Over the last few years, generative materials models from companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have drawn on their training data to help researchers design tens of millions of new materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to designing materials with exotic quantum properties like superconductivity or unique magnetic states, those models struggle. That’s too bad, because humans could use the help. For example, after a decade of research into a class of materials that could revolutionize quantum computing, called quantum spin liquids, only a dozen material candidates have been identified. The bottleneck means there are fewer materials to serve as the basis for technological breakthroughs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, MIT researchers have developed a technique that lets popular generative materials models create promising quantum materials by following specific design rules. The rules, or constraints, steer models to create materials with unique structures that give rise to quantum properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The models from these large companies generate materials optimized for stability,” says Mingda Li, MIT’s Class of 1947 Career Development Professor. “Our perspective is that’s not usually how materials science advances. We don’t need 10 million new materials to change the world. We just need one really good material.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach is described today in a &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-025-02355-y\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper published by &lt;em&gt;Nature Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties. From that pool, they synthesized two actual materials with exotic magnetic traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People in the quantum community really care about these geometric constraints, like the Kagome lattices that are two overlapping, upside-down triangles. We created materials with Kagome lattices because those materials can mimic the behavior of rare earth elements, so they are of high technical importance.” Li says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Li is the senior author of the paper. His MIT co-authors include PhD students Ryotaro Okabe,&amp;nbsp;Mouyang Cheng, Abhijatmedhi Chotrattanapituk, and Denisse Cordova Carrizales; postdoc Manasi Mandal; undergraduate researchers Kiran Mak and Bowen Yu; visiting scholar Nguyen Tuan Hung; Xiang Fu ’22, PhD ’24; and professor of electrical engineering and computer science Tommi Jaakkola, who is an affiliate of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Institute for Data, Systems, and Society. Additional co-authors include Yao Wang of Emory University, Weiwei Xie of Michigan State University, YQ Cheng of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Robert Cava of Princeton University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steering models toward impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A material’s properties are determined by its structure, and quantum materials are no different. Certain atomic structures are more likely to give rise to exotic quantum properties than others. For instance, square lattices can serve as a platform for high-temperature superconductors, while other shapes known as Kagome and Lieb lattices can support the creation of materials that could be useful for quantum computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help a popular class of generative models known as a diffusion models produce materials that conform to particular geometric patterns, the researchers created SCIGEN (short for Structural Constraint Integration in GENerative model). SCIGEN is a computer code that ensures diffusion models adhere to user-defined constraints at each iterative generation step. With SCIGEN, users can give any generative AI diffusion model geometric structural rules to follow as it generates materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI diffusion models work by sampling from their training dataset to generate structures that reflect the distribution of structures found in the dataset. SCIGEN blocks generations that don’t align with the structural rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test SCIGEN, the researchers applied it to a popular AI materials generation model known as DiffCSP. They had the SCIGEN-equipped model generate materials with unique geometric patterns known as Archimedean lattices, which are collections of 2D lattice tilings of different polygons. Archimedean lattices can lead to a range of quantum phenomena and have been the focus of much research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Archimedean lattices give rise to quantum spin liquids and so-called flat bands, which can mimic the properties of rare earths without rare earth elements, so they are extremely important,” says Cheng, a co-corresponding author of the work. “Other Archimedean lattice materials have large pores that could be used for carbon capture and other applications, so it’s a collection of special materials. In some cases, there are no known materials with that lattice, so I think it will be really interesting to find the first material that fits in that lattice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model generated over 10 million material candidates with Archimedean lattices. One million of those materials survived a screening for stability. Using the supercomputers in Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the researchers then took a smaller sample of 26,000 materials and ran detailed simulations to understand how the materials’ underlying atoms behaved. The researchers found magnetism in 41 percent of those structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that subset, the researchers synthesized two previously undiscovered compounds, TiPdBi and TiPbSb, at Xie and Cava’s labs. Subsequent experiments showed the AI model’s predictions largely aligned with the actual material’s properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to discover new materials that could have a huge potential impact by incorporating these structures that have been known to give rise to quantum properties,” says Okabe, the paper’s first author. “We already know that these materials with specific geometric patterns are interesting, so it’s natural to start with them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerating material breakthroughs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quantum spin liquids could unlock quantum computing by enabling stable, error-resistant qubits that serve as the basis of quantum operations. But no quantum spin liquid materials have been confirmed. Xie and Cava believe SCIGEN could accelerate the search for these materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a big search for quantum computer materials and topological superconductors, and these are all related to the geometric patterns of materials,” Xie says. “But experimental progress has been very, very slow,” Cava adds. “Many of these quantum spin liquid materials are subject to constraints: They have to be in a triangular lattice or a Kagome lattice. If the materials satisfy those constraints, the quantum researchers get excited; it’s a necessary but not sufficient condition. So, by generating many, many materials like that, it immediately gives experimentalists hundreds or thousands more candidates to play with to accelerate quantum computer materials research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work presents a new tool, leveraging machine learning, that can predict which materials will have specific elements in a desired geometric pattern,” says Drexel University Professor Steve May, who was not involved in the research. “This should speed up the development of previously unexplored materials for applications in next-generation electronic, magnetic, or optical technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers stress that experimentation is still critical to assess whether AI-generated materials can be synthesized and how their actual properties compare with model predictions. Future work on SCIGEN could incorporate additional design rules into generative models, including chemical and functional constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who want to change the world care about material properties more than the stability and structure of materials,” Okabe says. “With our approach, the ratio of stable materials goes down, but it opens the door to generate a whole bunch of promising materials.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy, the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, the National Science Foundation, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-genmaterial-01-press.jpg?itok=3ST3EvZG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The researchers applied their technique to generate millions of candidate materials consisting of geometric lattice structures associated with quantum properties.

Over the last few years, no technology has changed that craft more than artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are predicting a rapid and complete transformation in how startups are built, the Trust Center’s leaders have a more nuanced view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fundamentals of entrepreneurship haven’t changed with AI,” says Trust Center Entrepreneur in Residence Macauley Kenney. “There’s been a shift in how entrepreneurs accomplish tasks, and that trickles down into how you build a company, but we’re thinking of AI as another new tool in the toolkit. In some ways the world is moving a lot faster, but we also need to make sure the fundamental principles of entrepreneurship are well-understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach was on display during this summer’s delta v startup accelerator program, where many students regularly turned to AI tools but still ultimately relied on talking to their customers to make the right decisions for their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students in this year’s cohort used AI tools to accelerate their coding, draft presentations, learn about new industries, and brainstorm ideas. The Trust Center is encouraging students to use AI as they see fit while also staying mindful of the technology’s limitations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center itself has also embraced AI, most notably through Jetpack, its generative AI app that walks users through the 24 steps of disciplined entrepreneurship outlined in Managing Director Bill Aulet’s &lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2013/disciplined-entrepreneurship-bill-aulet-0826\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. When students input a startup idea, the tool can suggest customer segments, early markets to pursue, business models, pricing, and a product plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways the Trust Center wants students to use Jetpack is apparent in its name: It’s inspired by the acceleration a jetpack provides, but users still need to guide its direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with AI technology’s current limitations, the Trust Center’s leaders acknowledge it can be a powerful tool for people at any stage of building a business, and their use of AI will continue to evolve with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s undeniable we’re in the midst of an AI revolution right now,” says Entrepreneur in Residence Ben Soltoff. “AI is reshaping a lot of things we do, and it’s also shaping how we do entrepreneurship and how students build companies. The Trust Center has recognized that for years, and we’ve welcomed AI into how we teach entrepreneurship at all levels, from the earliest stages of idea formation to exploring and testing those ideas and understanding how to commercialize and scale them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI’s strengths and weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, when the Trust Center’s delta v staff get together for strategic retreats, AI has been a central topic. The delta v program’s organizers think about how students can get the most out of the technology each year as they plan their summer-long curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with Orbit, the mobile app designed to help students find entrepreneurial resources, network with peers, access mentorship, and identify events and jobs. Jetpack was added to Orbit last year. It is trained on Aulet’s “Disciplined Entrepreneurship” as well as former Trust Center Executive Director Paul Cheek’s “&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/3-questions-paul-cheek-startup-tactics-book-0503\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Startup Tactics&lt;/a&gt;” book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trust Center describes Jetpack’s outputs as first drafts designed to help students brainstorm their next steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to verify everything when you are using AI to build a business,” says Kenney, who is also a lecturer at MIT Sloan and MIT D-Lab. “I have yet to meet anyone who will base their business on the output of something like ChatGPT without verifying everything first. Sometimes, the verification can take longer than if you had done the research yourself from the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One company in this year’s cohort, Mendhai Health, uses AI and telehealth to offer personalized physical therapy for women struggling with pelvic floor dysfunction before and after childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“AI has definitely made the entrepreneurial process more efficient and faster,” says MBA student Aanchal Arora. “Still, overreliance on AI, at least at this point, can hamper your understanding of customers. You need to be careful with every decision you make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kenney notes the way large language models are built can make them less useful for entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some AI tools can increase your speed by doing things like automatically sorting your email or helping you vibe code apps, but many AI tools are built off averages, and those can be less effective when you’re trying to connect with a very specific demographic,” Kenney says. “It’s not helpful to have AI tell you about an average person, you need to personally have strong validation that your specific customer exists. If you try to build a tool for an average person, you may build a tool for no one at all.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students eager to embrace AI may also be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of tools available today. Fortunately, MIT students have a long history of being at the forefront of any new technology, and this year’s delta v cohort featured teams leveraging AI at the core of their solutions and in every step of their entrepreneurial journeys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT Sloan MBA candidate Murtaza Jameel, whose company Cognify uses AI to simulates user interactions with websites and apps to improve digital experiences, describes his firm as an AI-native business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re building a design intelligence tool that replaces product testing with instant, predictive simulations of user behavior,” Jameel explains. “We’re trying to integrate AI into all of our processes: ideation, go to market, programming. All of our building has been done with AI coding tools. I have a custom bot that I’ve fed tons of information about our company to, and it’s a thought partner I’m speaking to every single day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more things change…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fundamentals the Trust Center doesn’t see changing is the need for students to get out of the lab or the classroom to talk to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are ways that AI can unlock new capabilities and make things move faster, but we haven’t turned our curriculum on its head because of AI,” Soltoff says. “In delta v, we stress first and foremost: What are you building and who are you building it for? AI alone can’t tell you who your customer is, what they want, and how you can better serve their needs. You need to go out into the world to make that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, many of the biggest hurdles delta v teams faced this summer looked a lot like the hurdles entrepreneurs have always faced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were prepared at the Trust Center to see a big change and to adapt to that, but the companies are still building and encountering the same challenges of customer identification, beachhead market identification, team dynamics,” Kenney says. “Those are still the big meaty challenges they’ve always been working on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid endless hype about AI agents and the future of work, many founders this summer still said the human side of delta v is what makes the program special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I came to MIT with one goal: to start a technology company,” Jameel says. “The delta v program was on my radar when I was applying to MIT. The program gives you incredible access to resources — networks, mentorship, advisors. Some of the top folks in our industry are advising us now on how to build our company. It’s really unique. These are folks who have done what you’re doing 10 or 20 years ago, all just rooting for you. That’s why I came to MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-Entrepreneurs-01-press.jpg?itok=WovQMRvc\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The 2025 delta v accelerator cohort poses on stage for a group photo at the delta v demo day.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the Martin Trust Center</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/business\">Business and management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/martin-trust-center-mit-entrepreneurship\">Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>What does the future hold for generative AI?</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919</link>\n  <description>At the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium Symposium, researchers and business leaders discussed potential advancements centered on this powerful technology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 19 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/what-does-future-hold-generative-ai-0919</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the world in 2022, it brought generative artificial intelligence into the mainstream and started a snowball effect that led to its rapid integration into industry, scientific research, health care, and the everyday lives of people who use the technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What comes next for this powerful but imperfect tool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that question in mind, hundreds of researchers, business leaders, educators, and students gathered at MIT’s Kresge Auditorium for the inaugural MIT Generative AI Impact Consortium (MGAIC) Symposium on Sept. 17 to share insights and discuss the potential future of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a pivotal moment — generative AI is moving fast. It is our job to make sure that, as the technology keeps advancing, our collective wisdom keeps pace,” said MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan to kick off this first symposium of the MGAIC, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2025/introducing-mit-generative-ai-impact-consortium-0203\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;consortium&lt;/a&gt; of industry leaders and MIT researchers launched in February to harness the power of generative AI for the good of society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the critical need for this collaborative effort, MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of MIT’s responsibility is to keep these advances coming for the world. … How can we manage the magic [of generative AI] so that all of us can confidently rely on it for critical applications in the real world?” Kornbluth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keynote speaker Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, the most exciting and significant advances in generative AI will most likely not come from continued improvements or expansions of large language models like Llama, GPT, and Claude. Through training, these enormous generative models learn patterns in huge datasets to produce new outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, LuCun and others are working on the development of “world models” that learn the same way an infant does — by seeing and interacting with the world around them through sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A 4-year-old has seen as much data through vision as the largest LLM. … The world model is going to become the key component of future AI systems,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robot with this type of world model could learn to complete a new task on its own with no training. LeCun sees world models as the best approach for companies to make robots smart enough to be generally useful in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if future generative AI systems do get smarter and more human-like through the incorporation of world models, LeCun doesn’t worry about robots escaping from human control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists and engineers will need to design guardrails to keep future AI systems on track, but as a society, we have already been doing this for millennia by designing rules to align human behavior with the common good, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are going to have to design these guardrails, but by construction, the system will not be able to escape those guardrails,” LeCun said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote speaker Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, also discussed how generative AI could impact the future of robotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, Amazon has already incorporated generative AI technology into many of its warehouses to optimize how robots travel and move material to streamline order processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects many future innovations will focus on the use of generative AI in collaborative robotics by building machines that allow humans to become more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GenAI is probably the most impactful technology I have witnessed throughout my whole robotics career,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other presenters and panelists discussed the impacts of generative AI in businesses, from largescale enterprises like Coca-Cola and Analog Devices to startups like health care AI company Abridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several MIT faculty members also spoke about their latest research projects, including the use of AI to reduce noise in ecological image data, designing new AI systems that mitigate bias and hallucinations, and enabling LLMs to learn more about the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a day spent exploring new generative AI technology and discussing its implications for the future, MGAIC faculty co-lead Vivek Farias, the Patrick J. McGovern Professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, said he hoped attendees left with “a sense of possibility, and urgency to make that possibility real.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT_MGAIC_01-press.jpg?itok=RAAJ5NOt\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT President Sally Kornbluth said that the world is counting on faculty, researchers, and business leaders like those in MGAIC to tackle the technological and ethical challenges of generative AI as the technology advances.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: Gretchen Ertl</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/special-events\">Special events and guest speakers</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/robotics\">Robotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/industry\">Industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/president-sally-kornbluth\">President Sally Kornbluth</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/provost\">Provost</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>How to build AI scaling laws for efficient LLM training and budget maximization</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-build-ai-scaling-laws-efficient-llm-training-budget-maximization-0916</link>\n  <description>MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers have developed a universal guide for estimating how large language models will perform based on smaller models in the same family.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-build-ai-scaling-laws-efficient-llm-training-budget-maximization-0916</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Lauren Hinkel | MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When researchers are building large language models (LLMs), they aim to maximize performance under a particular computational and financial budget. Since training a model can amount to millions of dollars, developers need to be judicious with cost-impacting decisions about, for instance, the model architecture, optimizers, and training datasets before committing to a model. To anticipate the quality and accuracy of a large model’s predictions, practitioners often turn to scaling laws: using smaller, cheaper models to try to approximate the performance of a much larger target model. The challenge, however, is that there are thousands of ways to create a scaling law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New work from MIT and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers addresses this by amassing and releasing a collection of hundreds of models and metrics concerning training and performance to approximate more than a thousand scaling laws. From this, the team developed a meta-analysis and guide for how to select small models and estimate scaling laws for different LLM model families, so that the budget is optimally applied toward generating reliable performance predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The notion that you might want to try to build mathematical models of the training process is a couple of years old, but I think what was new here is that most of the work that people had been doing before is saying, ‘can we say something post-hoc about what happened when we trained all of these models, so that when we’re trying to figure out how to train a new large-scale model, we can make the best decisions about how to use our compute budget?’” says Jacob Andreas, associate professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and principal investigator with the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning by Andreas, along with MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab researchers Leshem Choshen and Yang Zhang of IBM Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extrapolating performance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how you slice it, developing LLMs is an expensive endeavor: from decision-making regarding the numbers of parameters and tokens, data selection and size, and training techniques to determining output accuracy and tuning to the target applications and tasks. Scaling laws offer a way to forecast model behavior by relating a large model’s loss to the performance of smaller, less-costly models from the same family, avoiding the need to fully train every candidate. Mainly, the differences between the smaller models are the number of parameters and token training size. According to Choshen, elucidating scaling laws not only enable better pre-training decisions, but also democratize the field by enabling researchers without vast resources to understand and build effective scaling laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The functional form of scaling laws is relatively simple, incorporating components from the small models that capture the number of parameters and their scaling effect, the number of training tokens and their scaling effect, and the baseline performance for the model family of interest. Together, they help researchers estimate a target large model’s performance loss; the smaller the loss, the better the target model’s outputs are likely to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These laws allow research teams to weigh trade-offs efficiently and to test how best to allocate limited resources. They’re particularly useful for evaluating scaling of a certain variable, like the number of tokens, and for A/B testing of different pre-training setups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, scaling laws aren’t new; however, in the field of AI, they emerged as models grew and costs skyrocketed. “It’s like scaling laws just appeared at some point in the field,” says Choshen. “They started getting attention, but no one really tested how good they are and what you need to do to make a good scaling law.” Further, scaling laws were themselves also a black box, in a sense. “Whenever people have created scaling laws in the past, it has always just been one model, or one model family, and one dataset, and one developer,” says Andreas. “There hadn’t really been a lot of systematic meta-analysis, as everybody is individually training their own scaling laws. So, [we wanted to know,] are there high-level trends that you see across those things?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, Choshen, Andreas, and Zhang created a large dataset. They collected LLMs from 40 model families, including Pythia, OPT, OLMO, LLaMA, Bloom, T5-Pile, ModuleFormer mixture-of-experts, GPT, and other families. These included 485 unique, pre-trained models, and where available, data about their training checkpoints, computational cost (FLOPs), training epochs, and the seed, along with 1.9 million performance metrics of loss and downstream tasks. The models differed in their architectures, weights, and so on. Using these models, the researchers fit over 1,000 scaling laws and compared their accuracy across architectures, model sizes, and training regimes, as well as testing how the number of models, inclusion of intermediate training checkpoints, and partial training impacted the predictive power of scaling laws to target models. They used measurements of absolute relative error (ARE); this is the difference between the scaling law’s prediction and the observed loss of a large, trained model. With this, the team compared the scaling laws, and after analysis, distilled practical recommendations for AI practitioners about what makes effective scaling laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their shared guidelines walk the developer through steps and options to consider and expectations. First, it’s critical to decide on a compute budget and target model accuracy. The team found that 4 percent ARE is about the best achievable accuracy one could expect due to random seed noise, but up to 20 percent ARE is still useful for decision-making. The researchers identified several factors that improve predictions, like including intermediate training checkpoints, rather than relying only on final losses; this made scaling laws more reliable. However, very early training data before 10 billion tokens are noisy, reduce accuracy, and should be discarded. They recommend prioritizing training more models across a spread of sizes to improve robustness of the scaling law’s prediction, not just larger models; selecting five models provides a solid starting point.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, including larger models improves prediction, but costs can be saved by partially training the target model to about 30 percent of its dataset and using that for extrapolation. If the budget is considerably constrained, developers should consider training one smaller model within the target model family and borrow scaling law parameters from a model family with similar architecture; however, this may not work for encoder–decoder models. Lastly, the MIT-IBM research group found that when scaling laws were compared across model families, there was strong correlation between two sets of hyperparameters, meaning that three of the five hyperparameters explained nearly all of the variation and could likely capture the model behavior. Together, these guidelines provide a systematic approach to making scaling law estimation more efficient, reliable, and accessible for AI researchers working under varying budget constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several surprises arose during this work: small models partially trained are still very predictive, and further, the intermediate training stages from a fully trained model can be used (as if they are individual models) for prediction of another target model. “Basically, you don’t pay anything in the training, because you already trained the full model, so the half-trained model, for instance, is just a byproduct of what you did,” says Choshen. Another feature Andreas pointed out was that, when aggregated, the variability across model families and different experiments jumped out and was noisier than expected. Unexpectedly, the researchers found that it’s possible to utilize the scaling laws on large models to predict performance down to smaller models. Other research in the field has hypothesized that smaller models were a “different beast” compared to large ones; however, Choshen disagrees. “If they’re totally different, they should have shown totally different behavior, and they don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this work focused on model training time, the researchers plan to extend their analysis to model inference. Andreas says it’s not, “how does my model get better as I add more training data or more parameters, but instead as I let it think for longer, draw more samples. I think there are definitely lessons to be learned here about how to also build predictive models of how much thinking you need to do at run time.” He says the theory of inference time scaling laws might become even more critical because, “it’s not like I'm going to train one model and then be done. [Rather,] it’s every time a user comes to me, they’re going to have a new query, and I need to figure out how hard [my model needs] to think to come up with the best answer. So, being able to build those kinds of predictive models, like we’re doing in this paper, is even more important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was supported, in part, by the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab and a Sloan Research Fellowship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/Increasing-LLM-size.jpg?itok=I-0gEXtr\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Scaling laws enable researchers to use smaller LLMs to predict the performance of a significantly bigger target model, thus allowing better allocation of computational power.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: AdobeStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab\">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Machine-learning tool gives doctors a more detailed 3D picture of fetal health</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-tool-gives-doctors-more-detailed-3d-picture-fetal-health-0915</link>\n  <description>MIT CSAIL researchers developed a tool that can model the shape and movements of fetuses in 3D, potentially assisting doctors in finding abnormalities and making diagnoses.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/machine-learning-tool-gives-doctors-more-detailed-3d-picture-fetal-health-0915</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Alex Shipps | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-9f9513be-7fff-adbc-e573-265de5f3d249\"&gt;For pregnant women, ultrasounds are an informative (and sometimes necessary) procedure. They typically produce two-dimensional black-and-white scans of fetuses that can reveal key insights, including biological sex, approximate size, and abnormalities like heart issues or cleft lip. If your doctor wants a closer look, they may use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which uses magnetic fields to capture images that can be combined to create a 3D view of the fetus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MRIs aren’t a catch-all, though; the 3D scans are difficult for doctors to interpret well enough to diagnose problems because our visual system is not accustomed to processing 3D volumetric scans (in other words, a wrap-around look that also shows us the inner structures of a subject). Enter machine learning, which could help model a fetus’s development more clearly and accurately from data — although no such algorithm has been able to model their somewhat random movements and various body shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;That is, until a new approach called “Fetal SMPL” from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), Boston Children’s Hospital (BCH), and Harvard Medical School presented clinicians with a more detailed picture of fetal health. It was adapted from “SMPL” (Skinned Multi-Person Linear model), a 3D model developed in computer graphics to capture adult body shapes and poses, as a way to represent fetal body shapes and poses accurately. Fetal SMPL was then trained on 20,000 MRI volumes to predict the location and size of a fetus and create sculpture-like 3D representations. Inside each model is a skeleton with 23 articulated joints called a “kinematic tree,” which the system uses to pose and move like the fetuses it saw during training.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The extensive, real-world scans that Fetal SMPL learned from helped it develop pinpoint accuracy. Imagine stepping into a stranger’s footprint while blindfolded, and not only does it fit perfectly, but you correctly guess what shoe they wore — similarly, the tool closely matched the position and size of fetuses in MRI frames it hadn’t seen before. Fetal SMPL was only misaligned by an average of about 3.1 millimeters, a gap smaller than a single grain of rice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The approach could enable doctors to precisely measure things like the size of a baby’s head or abdomen and compare these metrics with healthy fetuses at the same age. Fetal SMPL has demonstrated its clinical potential in early tests, where it achieved accurate alignment results on a small group of real-world scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“It can be challenging to estimate the shape and pose of a fetus because they’re crammed into the tight confines of the uterus,” says lead author, MIT PhD student, and CSAIL researcher Yingcheng Liu SM ’21. “Our approach overcomes this challenge using a system of interconnected bones under the surface of the 3D model, which represent the fetal body and its motions realistically. Then, it relies on a coordinate descent algorithm to make a prediction, essentially alternating between guessing pose and shape from tricky data until it finds a reliable estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In utero&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fetal SMPL was tested on shape and pose accuracy against the closest baseline the researchers could find: a system that models infant growth called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://files.is.tue.mpg.de/black/papers/miccai18.pdf\"&gt;“SMIL.”&lt;/a&gt; Since babies out of the womb are larger than fetuses, the team shrank those models by 75 percent to level the playing field.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The system outperformed this baseline on a dataset of fetal MRIs between the gestational ages of 24 and 37 weeks taken at Boston Children’s Hospital. Fetal SMPL was able to recreate real scans more precisely, as its models closely lined up with real MRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The method was efficient at lining up their models to images, only needing three iterations to arrive at a reasonable alignment. In an experiment that counted how many incorrect guesses Fetal SMPL had made before arriving at a final estimate, its accuracy plateaued from the fourth step onward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers have just begun testing their system in the real world, where it produced similarly accurate models in initial clinical tests. While these results are promising, the team notes that they’ll need to apply their results to larger populations, different gestational ages, and a variety of disease cases to better understand the system’s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only skin deep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Liu also notes that their system only helps analyze what doctors can see on the surface of a fetus, since only bone-like structures lie beneath the skin of the models. To better monitor babies’ internal health, such as liver, lung, and muscle development, the team intends to make their tool volumetric, modeling the fetus’s inner anatomy from scans. Such upgrades would make the models more human-like, but the current version of Fetal SMPL already presents a precise (and unique) upgrade to 3D fetal health analysis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This study introduces a method specifically designed for fetal MRI that effectively captures fetal movements, enhancing the assessment of fetal development and health,” says Kiho Im, Harvard Medical School associate professor of pediatrics and staff scientist in the Division of Newborn Medicine at BCH’s Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center. Im, who was not involved with the paper, adds that this approach “will not only improve the diagnostic utility of fetal MRI, but also provide insights into the early functional development of the fetal brain in relation to body movements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This work reaches a pioneering milestone by extending parametric surface human body models for the earliest shapes of human life: fetuses,” says Sergi Pujades, an associate professor at University Grenoble Alpes, who wasn’t involved in the research. “It allows us to detangle the shape and motion of a human, which has already proven to be key in understanding how adult body shape relates to metabolic conditions and how infant motion relates to neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, the fact that the fetal model stems from, and is compatible with, the adult (SMPL) and infant (SMIL) body models, will allow us to study human shape and pose evolution over long periods of time. This is an unprecedented opportunity to further quantify how human shape growth and motion are affected by different conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liu wrote the paper with three CSAIL members: Peiqi Wang SM ’22, PhD ’25; MIT PhD student Sebastian Diaz; and senior author Polina Golland, the Sunlin and Priscilla Chou Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a principal investigator in MIT CSAIL, and the leader of the Medical Vision Group. BCH assistant professor of pediatrics Esra Abaci Turk, Inria researcher Benjamin Billot, and Harvard Medical School professor of pediatrics and professor of radiology Patricia Ellen Grant are also authors on the paper.

The center will be part of the fourth phase of NNSA's&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://psaap.llnl.gov/\"&gt;Predictive Science Academic Alliance Program&lt;/a&gt; (PSAAP-IV), which supports frontier research advancing the predictive capabilities of high-performance computing for open science and engineering applications relevant to national security mission spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://chefsi.mit.edu/\"&gt;Center for the Exascale Simulation of Coupled High-Enthalpy Fluid–Solid Interactions&lt;/a&gt; (CHEFSI) — a joint effort of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://cse.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Center for Computational Science and Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://computing.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Schwarzman College of Computing&lt;/a&gt;, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://isn.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies&lt;/a&gt; (ISN) —&amp;nbsp;plans to harness &lt;a name=\"_Int_hvY0bt2J\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;cutting-edge exascale supercomputers and next-generation algorithms to simulate with unprecedented detail how extremely hot, fast-moving gaseous and solid materials interact. The understanding of these extreme environments — characterized by temperatures of more than 1,500 degrees Celsius and speeds as high as Mach&amp;nbsp;25 — and their effect on vehicles is central to national security, space exploration, and the development of advanced thermal protection systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CHEFSI will capitalize on MIT’s deep strengths in predictive modeling, high-performance computing, and STEM education to help ensure the United States remains at the forefront of scientific and technological innovation,” says Ian A. Waitz, MIT’s vice president for research. “The center’s particular relevance to national security and advanced technologies exemplifies MIT’s commitment to advancing research with broad societal benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI is one of five new Predictive Simulation Centers announced by the NNSA as part of a program expected to provide up to $17.5 million to each center over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI’s research aims to couple detailed simulations of high-enthalpy gas flows with models of the chemical, thermal, and mechanical behavior of solid materials, capturing phenomena such as oxidation, nitridation, ablation, and fracture. Advanced computational models — validated by carefully designed experiments — can address the limitations of flight testing by providing critical insights into material performance and failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By integrating high-fidelity physics models with artificial intelligence-based surrogate models, experimental validation, and state-of-the-art exascale computational tools, CHEFSI will help us understand and predict how thermal protection systems perform under some of the harshest conditions encountered in engineering systems,” says Raúl Radovitzky, the Jerome C. Hunsaker Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, associate director of the ISN, and director of CHEFSI. “This knowledge will help in the design of resilient systems for applications ranging from reusable spacecraft to hypersonic vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radovitzky will be joined on the center’s leadership team by Youssef Marzouk, the Breene M. Kerr (1951) Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics, co-director of the MIT Center for Computational Science and Engineering (CCSE), and recently named the associate dean of the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing; and Nicolas Hadjiconstantinou, the Quentin Berg (1937) Professor of Mechanical Engineering and co-director of CCSE, who will serve as associate directors. The center&amp;nbsp;co-principal investigators include MIT faculty members across the departments of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Materials Science and Engineering, Mathematics, and Mechanical Engineering. Franklin Hadley will lead center operations, with administration and finance under the&amp;nbsp;purview of Joshua Freedman. Hadley and Freedman are both members of the ISN headquarters team.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEFSI expects to collaborate extensively with the DoE/NNSA national laboratories —&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories — and, in doing so, offer graduate students and postdocs immersive research experiences and internships at these facilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/orion-reentry-00.jpg?itok=GkvaXXWN\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers in the new MIT Center for the Exascale Simulation of Coupled High-Enthalpy Fluid–Solid Interactions will study environments and material interactions such as those involved in the reentry of spacecraft into Earth's atmosphere.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Illustration: NASA</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/supercomputing\">Supercomputing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/space\">Space</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/security-studies\">Security studies and military</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dmse\">DMSE</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/doe\">Department of Energy (DoE)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>AI and machine learning for engineering design</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-machine-learning-for-engineering-design-0907</link>\n  <description>Popular mechanical engineering course applies machine learning and AI theory to real-world engineering design.</description>\n  <pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/ai-machine-learning-for-engineering-design-0907</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Wilson | Department of Mechanical Engineering</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence optimization offers a host of benefits for mechanical engineers, including faster and more accurate designs and simulations, improved efficiency, reduced development costs through process automation, and enhanced predictive maintenance and quality control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When people think about mechanical&amp;nbsp;engineering, they're thinking about basic mechanical tools like&amp;nbsp;hammers and … hardware like cars, robots, cranes, but mechanical engineering is very broad,” says Faez Ahmed, the Doherty Chair in Ocean Utilization and associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT. “Within mechanical engineering,&amp;nbsp;machine learning, AI, and optimization are playing a big role.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ahmed’s course, &lt;a href=\"https://meche.mit.edu/featured-classes/artificial-intelligence-and-machine-learning-engineering-design\"&gt;2.155/156&lt;/a&gt; (AI and Machine Learning for Engineering Design), students use tools and techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning for mechanical engineering design, focusing on the creation of new products and addressing engineering design challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a lot of reason for mechanical engineers to think about machine learning and AI to essentially expedite the design process,” says Lyle Regenwetter, a teaching assistant for the course and a PhD candidate in Ahmed’s Design Computation and Digital Engineering Lab (DeCoDE), where research focuses on developing new machine learning and optimization methods to study complex engineering design problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First offered in 2021, the class has quickly become one of the Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE)’s most popular non-core offerings, attracting students from departments across the Institute, including mechanical and civil and environmental engineering, aeronautics and astronautics, the MIT Sloan School of Management, and nuclear and computer science, along with cross-registered students from Harvard University and other schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The course, which is open to both undergraduate and graduate students, focuses on the implementation of advanced machine learning and optimization strategies in the context of real-world mechanical design problems.&amp;nbsp;From designing&amp;nbsp;bike frames to city grids, students participate in contests related to AI for physical systems and&amp;nbsp;tackle optimization challenges in a class environment fueled by friendly competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students are given challenge problems and starter code that “gave a solution, but [not] the best solution …” explains Ilan Moyer, a graduate student in MechE. “Our task was to [determine],&amp;nbsp;how can we do better?” Live leaderboards encourage students to continually refine their methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Em Lauber, a system design and management graduate student, says the process gave space to explore the application of what students were learning and the practice skill of “literally how to code it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The curriculum incorporates discussions on research papers, and students also pursue hands-on exercises in machine learning tailored to specific engineering issues including robotics, aircraft, structures, and metamaterials. For their final project, students work together on a team project that employs AI techniques for design on a complex problem of their choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is wonderful to see the diverse breadth and high quality of class projects,” says Ahmed. “Student projects from this course often lead to research publications, and have even led to awards.” He cites the example of a recent paper, titled “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23287\"&gt;GenCAD-Self-Repairing&lt;/a&gt;,” that went on to win the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Systems Engineering, Information and Knowledge Management 2025 Best Paper Award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best part about the final project was that it gave every student the opportunity to apply what they’ve learned in the class to an area that interests them a lot,” says Malia Smith, a graduate student in MechE. Her project chose “markered motion captured data” and looked at predicting ground force for runners, an effort she called “really gratifying” because it worked so much better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lauber took the framework of a “cat tree” design with different modules of poles, platforms, and ramps to create customized solutions for individual cat households, while Moyer created software that is designing a new type of 3D printer architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you see machine learning in popular culture, it’s very abstracted, and you have the sense that there’s something very complicated going on,” says Moyer. “This class has opened the curtains.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-AI-Design-B_0.jpg?itok=MPVjWyPQ\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT mechanical engineering graduate student Malia Smith (left) asks teaching assistant Noah Bagazinski for feedback on her final project for course 2.155/156 (AI and Machine Learning for Engineering Design).</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Lauren Futami</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/students\">Students</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/design\">Design</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/civil-engineering\">Civil and environmental engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/aeronautics\">Aeronautical and astronautical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A greener way to 3D print stronger stuff</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/greener-way-3d-print-stronger-stuff-0904</link>\n  <description>MIT CSAIL researchers developed SustainaPrint, a system that reinforces only the weakest zones of eco-friendly 3D prints, achieving strong results with less plastic.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 2025 16:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/greener-way-3d-print-stronger-stuff-0904</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-8a16a100-7fff-866e-17d3-0c98f0ab7768\"&gt;3D printing has come a long way since its invention in 1983 by Chuck Hull, who pioneered stereolithography, a technique that solidifies liquid resin into solid objects using ultraviolet lasers. Over the decades, 3D printers have evolved from experimental curiosities into tools capable of producing everything from custom prosthetics to complex food designs, architectural models, and even functioning human organs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;But as the technology matures, its environmental footprint has become increasingly difficult to set aside. The vast majority of consumer and industrial 3D printing still relies on petroleum-based plastic filament. And while “greener” alternatives made from biodegradable or recycled materials exist, they come with a serious trade-off: they’re often not as strong. These eco-friendly filaments tend to become brittle under stress, making them ill-suited for structural applications or load-bearing parts — exactly where strength matters most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;This trade-off between sustainability and mechanical performance prompted researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the Hasso Plattner Institute to ask: Is it possible to build objects that are mostly eco-friendly, but still strong where it counts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Their answer is &lt;a href=\"https://maxineaps.github.io/sustainaprint-project-site/\"&gt;SustainaPrint&lt;/a&gt;, a new software and hardware toolkit designed to help users strategically combine strong and weak filaments to get the best of both worlds. Instead of printing an entire object with high-performance plastic, the system analyzes a model through finite element analysis simulations, predicts where the object is most likely to experience stress, and then reinforces just those zones with stronger material. The rest of the part can be printed using greener, weaker filament, reducing plastic use while preserving structural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Our hope is that SustainaPrint can be used in industrial and distributed manufacturing settings one day, where local material stocks may vary in quality and composition,” says MIT PhD student and CSAIL researcher Maxine Perroni-Scharf, who is a lead author on a &lt;a href=\"https://maxineaps.github.io/sustainaprint-project-site/\"&gt;paper presenting the project&lt;/a&gt;. “In these contexts, the testing toolkit could help ensure the reliability of available filaments, while the software’s reinforcement strategy could reduce overall material consumption without sacrificing function.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For their experiments, the team used Polymaker’s PolyTerra PLA as the eco-friendly filament, and standard or Tough PLA from Ultimaker for reinforcement. They used a 20 percent reinforcement threshold to show that even a small amount of strong plastic goes a long way. Using this ratio, SustainaPrint was able to recover up to 70 percent of the strength of an object printed entirely with high-performance plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;They printed dozens of objects, from simple mechanical shapes like rings and beams to more functional household items such as headphone stands, wall hooks, and plant pots. Each object was printed three ways: once using only eco-friendly filament, once using only strong PLA, and once with the hybrid SustainaPrint configuration. The printed parts were then mechanically tested by pulling, bending, or otherwise breaking them to measure how much force each configuration could withstand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In many cases, the hybrid prints held up nearly as well as the full-strength versions. For example, in one test involving a dome-like shape, the hybrid version outperformed the version printed entirely in Tough PLA. The team believes this may be due to the reinforced version’s ability to distribute stress more evenly, avoiding the brittle failure sometimes caused by excessive stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This indicates that in certain geometries and loading conditions, mixing materials strategically may actually outperform a single homogenous material,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It’s a reminder that real-world mechanical behavior is full of complexity, especially in 3D printing, where interlayer adhesion and tool path decisions can affect performance in unexpected ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lean, green, eco-friendly printing machine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;SustainaPrint starts off by letting a user upload their 3D model into a custom interface. By selecting fixed regions and areas where forces will be applied, the software then uses an approach called “Finite Element Analysis” to simulate how the object will deform under stress. It then creates a map showing pressure distribution inside the structure, highlighting areas under compression or tension, and applies heuristics to segment the object into two categories: those that need reinforcement, and those that don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Recognizing the need for accessible and low-cost testing, the team also developed a DIY testing toolkit to help users assess strength before printing. The kit has a 3D-printable device with modules for measuring both tensile and flexural strength. Users can pair the device with common items like pull-up bars or digital scales to get rough, but reliable performance metrics. The team benchmarked their results against manufacturer data and found that their measurements consistently fell within one standard deviation, even for filaments that had undergone multiple recycling cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Although the current system is designed for dual-extrusion printers, the researchers believe that with some manual filament swapping and calibration, it could be adapted for single-extruder setups, too. In current form, the system simplifies the modeling process by allowing just one force and one fixed boundary per simulation. While this covers a wide range of common use cases, the team sees future work expanding the software to support more complex and dynamic loading conditions. The team also sees potential in using AI to infer the object’s intended use based on its geometry, which could allow for fully automated stress modeling without manual input of forces or boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D for free&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers plan to release SustainaPrint open-source, making both the software and testing toolkit available for public use and modification. Another initiative they aspire to bring to life in the future: education. “In a classroom, SustainaPrint isn’t just a tool, it’s a way to teach students about material science, structural engineering, and sustainable design, all in one project,” says Perroni-Scharf. “It turns these abstract concepts into something tangible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;As 3D printing becomes more embedded in how we manufacture and prototype everything from consumer goods to emergency equipment, sustainability concerns will only grow. With tools like SustainaPrint, those concerns no longer need to come at the expense of performance. Instead, they can become part of the design process: built into the very geometry of the things we make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Co-author Patrick Baudisch, who is a professor at the Hasso Plattner Institute, adds that “the project addresses a key question: What is the point of collecting material for the purpose of recycling, when there is no plan to actually ever use that material? Maxine presents the missing link between the theoretical/abstract idea of 3D printing material recycling and what it actually takes to make this idea relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Perroni-Scharf and Baudisch wrote the paper with CSAIL research assistant Jennifer Xiao; MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science master’s student Cole Paulin ’24; master’s student Ray Wang SM ’25 and PhD student Ticha Sethapakdi SM ’19 (both CSAIL members); Hasso Plattner Institute PhD student Muhammad Abdullah; and Associate Professor Stefanie Mueller, lead of the Human-Computer Interaction Engineering Group at CSAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The researchers’ work was supported by a Designing for Sustainability Grant from the Designing for Sustainability MIT-HPI Research Program.

These have had limited success, in part because until now they have not been grounded in an understanding of fundamental physical principles, such as the laws of conservation of mass. Now, a team of researchers at MIT has come up with a way of incorporating these physical constraints on a reaction prediction model, and thus greatly improving the accuracy and reliability of its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new work was &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09426-9\"&gt;reported Aug. 20 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a paper by recent postdoc Joonyoung Joung (now an assistant professor at Kookmin University, South Korea); former software engineer Mun Hong Fong (now at Duke University); chemical engineering graduate student Nicholas Casetti; postdoc Jordan Liles; physics undergraduate student Ne Dassanayake; and senior author Connor Coley, who is the Class of 1957 Career Development Professor in the MIT departments of Chemical Engineering and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The prediction of reaction outcomes is a very important task,” Joung explains. For example, if you want to make a new drug, “you need to know how to make it. So, this requires us to know what product is likely” to result from a given set of chemical inputs to a reaction. But most previous efforts to carry out such predictions look only at a set of inputs and a set of outputs, without looking at the intermediate steps or considering the constraints of ensuring that no mass is gained or lost in the process, which is not possible in actual reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joung points out that while large language models such as ChatGPT have been very successful in many areas of research, these models do not provide a way to limit their outputs to physically realistic possibilities, such as by requiring them to adhere to conservation of mass. These models use computational “tokens,” which in this case represent individual atoms, but “if you don’t conserve the tokens, the LLM model starts to make new atoms, or deletes atoms in the reaction.” Instead of being grounded in real scientific understanding, “this is kind of like alchemy,” he says. While many attempts at reaction prediction only look at the final products, “we want to track all the chemicals, and how the chemicals are transformed” throughout the reaction process from start to end, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to address the problem, the team made use of a method developed back in the 1970s by chemist Ivar Ugi, which uses a bond-electron matrix to represent the electrons in a reaction. They used this system as the basis for their new program, called FlowER (Flow matching for Electron Redistribution), which allows them to explicitly keep track of all the electrons in the reaction to ensure that none are spuriously added or deleted in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system uses a matrix to represent the electrons in a reaction, and uses nonzero values to represent bonds or lone electron pairs and zeros to represent a lack thereof. “That helps us to conserve both atoms and electrons at the same time,” says Fong. This representation, he says, was one of the key elements to including mass conservation in their prediction system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The system they developed is still at an early stage, Coley says. “The system as it stands is a demonstration — a proof of concept that this generative approach of flow matching is very well suited to the task of chemical reaction prediction.” While the team is excited about this promising approach, he says, “we’re aware that it does have specific limitations as far as the breadth of different chemistries that it’s seen.” Although the model was trained using data on more than a million chemical reactions, obtained from a U.S. Patent Office database, those data do not include certain metals and some kinds of catalytic reactions, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re incredibly excited about the fact that we can get such reliable predictions of chemical mechanisms” from the existing system, he says. “It conserves mass, it conserves electrons, but we certainly acknowledge that there’s a lot more expansion and robustness to work on in the coming years as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even in its present form, which is being made freely available through the online platform GitHub, “we think it will make accurate predictions and be helpful as a tool for assessing reactivity and mapping out reaction pathways,” Coley says. “If we’re looking toward the future of really advancing the state of the art of mechanistic understanding and helping to invent new reactions, we’re not quite there. But we hope this will be a steppingstone toward that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s all open source,” says Fong. “The models, the data, all of them are up there,” including a previous dataset developed by Joung that exhaustively lists the mechanistic steps of known reactions. “I think we are one of the pioneering groups making this dataset, and making it available open-source, and making this usable for everyone,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FlowER model matches or outperforms existing approaches in finding standard mechanistic pathways, the team says, and makes it possible to generalize to previously unseen reaction types. They say the model could potentially be relevant for predicting reactions for medicinal chemistry, materials discovery, combustion, atmospheric chemistry, and electrochemical systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their comparisons with existing reaction prediction systems, Coley says, “using the architecture choices that we’ve made, we get this massive increase in validity and conservation, and we get a matching or a little bit better accuracy in terms of performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He adds that “what’s unique about our approach is that while we are using these textbook understandings of mechanisms to generate this dataset, we’re anchoring the reactants and products of the overall reaction in experimentally validated data from the patent literature.”&amp;nbsp;They are inferring the underlying mechanisms, he says, rather than just making them up. “We’re imputing them from experimental data, and that’s not something that has been done and shared at this kind of scale before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next step, he says, is “we are quite interested in expanding the model’s understanding of metals and catalytic cycles. We’ve just scratched the surface in this first paper,” and most of the reactions included so far don’t include metals or catalysts, “so that’s a direction we’re quite interested in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, he says, “a lot of the excitement is in using this kind of system to help discover new complex reactions and help elucidate new mechanisms. I think that the long-term potential impact is big, but this is of course just a first step.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work was supported by the Machine Learning for Pharmaceutical Discovery and Synthesis consortium and the National Science Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-flower.jpg?itok=xtPoC4hU\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The FlowER (Flow matching for Electron Redistribution) system allows a researcher to explicitly keep track of all the electrons in a reaction to ensure that none are spuriously added or deleted in the process of predicting the outcome of a chemical reaction.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image courtesy of the researchers.</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-source\">Open source</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nsf\">National Science Foundation (NSF)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>3 Questions: The pros and cons of synthetic data in AI </title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-pros-cons-synthetic-data-ai-kalyan-veeramachaneni-0903</link>\n  <description>Artificially created data offer benefits from cost savings to privacy preservation, but their limitations require careful planning and evaluation, Kalyan Veeramachaneni says.  </description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 03 Sep 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-pros-cons-synthetic-data-ai-kalyan-veeramachaneni-0903</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Synthetic data are artificially generated by algorithms to mimic the statistical properties of actual data, without containing any information from real-world sources. While concrete numbers are hard to pin down, some estimates suggest that more than 60 percent of data used for AI applications in 2024 was synthetic, and this figure is expected to grow across industries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because synthetic data don’t contain real-world information, they hold the promise of safeguarding privacy while reducing the cost and increasing the speed at which new AI models are developed. But&amp;nbsp;using synthetic data requires careful&amp;nbsp;evaluation, planning, and checks and balances to prevent loss of performance when AI models are deployed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To unpack some pros and cons of using synthetic data,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;MIT News&lt;em&gt; spoke with Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a principal research scientist in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems&amp;nbsp;and co-founder of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://datacebo.com\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DataCebo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;whose open-core platform,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the Synthetic Data Vault&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;helps&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;users generate and test synthetic data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;How are synthetic data created?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Synthetic data are algorithmically generated but do not come from a real situation. Their value lies in their statistical similarity to real data. If we’re talking about language, for instance, synthetic data look very much as if a human had written those sentences. While researchers have created synthetic data for a long time, what has changed in the past few years is our ability to build generative models out of data and use them to create realistic synthetic data. We can take a little bit of real data and build a generative model from that, which we can use to create as much synthetic data as we want. Plus, the model creates synthetic data in a way that captures all the underlying rules and infinite patterns that exist in the real data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are essentially&amp;nbsp;four&amp;nbsp;different data modalities: language, video or images,&amp;nbsp;audio,&amp;nbsp;and tabular data. All four&amp;nbsp;of them have slightly different ways of building the generative models to create synthetic data. An LLM, for instance, is nothing but a generative model from which you are sampling synthetic data when you ask it a question.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of language and image data are publicly available on the internet. But tabular data, which is the data collected when we interact with physical and social systems, is often locked up behind enterprise firewalls. Much of it is sensitive or private, such as customer transactions stored by a bank. For this type of data, platforms like the Synthetic Data Vault provide software that can be used to build generative models. Those models then create synthetic data that preserve customer privacy and can be shared more widely.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One powerful thing about this generative modeling approach for synthesizing data is that enterprises can now build a customized, local model for their own data. Generative AI automates what used to be a manual process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What are some benefits of using synthetic data, and which use-cases and applications are they particularly well-suited for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; One fundamental application which has grown tremendously over the past decade is using synthetic data to test software applications. There is data-driven logic behind many software applications, so you need data to test that software and its functionality. In the past, people have resorted to manually generating data, but now we can use generative models to create as much data as we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also create specific data for application testing. Say I work for an e-commerce company. I can generate synthetic data that mimics real customers who live in Ohio and made transactions pertaining to one particular product in February or March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because synthetic data aren’t drawn from real situations, they are also privacy-preserving. One of the biggest problems in software testing has been getting access to sensitive real data for testing software in non-production environments, due to privacy concerns.&amp;nbsp;Another immediate benefit is in performance testing. You can create a billion transactions from a generative model and test how fast your system can process them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another application where synthetic data hold a lot of promise is in training machine-learning models. Sometimes, we want an AI model to help us predict an event that is less frequent. A bank may want to use an AI model to predict fraudulent transactions, but there may be too few real examples to train a model that can identify fraud accurately.&amp;nbsp;Synthetic data provide data augmentation — additional data examples that are similar to the real data. These can significantly improve the accuracy of AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, sometimes users don’t have time or the financial resources to collect all the data. For instance, collecting data about customer intent would require conducting many surveys. If you end up with limited data and then try to train a model, it won’t perform well. You can augment by adding synthetic data to train those models better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;What are some of the risks or potential pitfalls of using synthetic data, and are there steps users can take to prevent or mitigate those problems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the biggest questions people often have in their mind is, if the data are synthetically created, why should I trust them? Determining whether you can trust the data often comes down to evaluating the overall system where you are using them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of aspects of synthetic data we have been able to evaluate for a long time. For instance, there are existing methods to measure how close synthetic data are to real data, and we can measure their quality and whether they preserve privacy. But there are other important considerations if you are using those synthetic data to train a machine-learning model for a new use case. How would you know the data are going to lead to models that still make valid conclusions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New efficacy metrics are emerging, and the emphasis is now on efficacy for a particular task. You must really dig into your workflow to ensure the synthetic data you add to the system still allow you to draw valid conclusions. That is something that must be done carefully on an application-by-application basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bias can also be an issue. Since it is created from a small amount of real data, the same bias that exists in the real data can carry over into the synthetic data. Just like with real data, you would need to purposefully make sure the bias is removed through different sampling techniques, which can create balanced datasets. It takes some careful planning, but you can calibrate the data generation to prevent the proliferation of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help with the evaluation process, our group created the &lt;a href=\"https://docs.sdv.dev/sdmetrics\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Synthetic Data Metrics Library&lt;/a&gt;. We worried that people would use synthetic data in their environment and it would give different conclusions in the real world. We created a metrics and evaluation library to&amp;nbsp;ensure&amp;nbsp;checks and balances. The machine learning community has faced a lot of challenges in ensuring models can generalize to new situations. The use of synthetic data adds a whole new dimension to that problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I expect that the old systems of working with data, whether to build software applications, answer analytical questions, or train models, will dramatically change as we get more sophisticated at building these generative models. A lot of things we have never been able to do before will now be possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202509/MIT-3Q-Synthetic-01-press.jpg?itok=kGcQGLUI\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Kalyan Veeramachaneni spoke with MIT News about the pros and cons of using synthetic data.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/interview\">Interview</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>3 Questions: On biology and medicine’s “data revolution”</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-caroline-uhler-biology-medicine-data-revolution-0902</link>\n  <description>Professor Caroline Uhler discusses her work at the Schmidt Center, thorny problems in math, and the ongoing quest to understand some of the most complex interactions in biology.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2025 17:45:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/3-questions-caroline-uhler-biology-medicine-data-revolution-0902</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Jane Halpern | Elvira Forte | Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Caroline Uhler is&amp;nbsp;an Andrew (1956) and Erna Viterbi Professor of Engineering at MIT; a professor of electrical engineering and computer science in the Institute for Data, Science, and Society (IDSS);&amp;nbsp;and director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, where she is also a core institute and scientific leadership team member.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uhler is interested in all the methods by which scientists can uncover causality in biological systems, ranging from causal discovery on observed variables to causal feature learning and representation learning.&amp;nbsp;In this interview, she discusses machine learning in biology, areas that are ripe for problem-solving, and cutting-edge research coming out of the Schmidt Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;The Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center has four distinct areas of focus structured around four natural levels of biological organization: proteins, cells, tissues, and organisms. What, within the current landscape of machine learning, makes&amp;nbsp;now the right time to work on these specific problem classes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Biology and medicine are currently undergoing a “data revolution.” The availability of large-scale, diverse datasets — ranging from genomics and multi-omics to high-resolution imaging and electronic health records — makes this an opportune time. Inexpensive and accurate DNA sequencing is a reality, advanced molecular imaging has become routine, and single cell genomics is allowing the profiling of millions of cells. These innovations — and the massive datasets they produce — have brought us to the threshold of a new era in biology, one where we will be able to move beyond characterizing the units of life (such as all proteins, genes, and cell types) to understanding the `programs of life’, such as the logic of gene circuits and cell-cell communication that underlies tissue patterning and the molecular mechanisms that underlie the genotype-phenotype map.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;At the same time, in the past decade, machine learning has seen remarkable progress with models like BERT, GPT-3, and ChatGPT demonstrating advanced capabilities in text understanding and generation, while vision transformers and multimodal models like CLIP have achieved human-level performance in image-related tasks. These breakthroughs provide powerful architectural blueprints and training strategies that can be adapted to biological data. For instance, transformers can model genomic sequences similar to language, and vision models can analyze medical and microscopy images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Importantly, biology is poised to be not just a beneficiary of machine learning, but also a significant source of inspiration for new ML research. Much like agriculture and breeding spurred modern statistics, biology has the potential to inspire new and perhaps even more profound avenues of ML research. Unlike fields such as recommender systems and internet advertising, where there are no natural laws to discover and predictive accuracy is the ultimate measure of value, in biology, phenomena are physically interpretable, and causal mechanisms are the ultimate goal. Additionally, biology boasts genetic and chemical tools that enable perturbational screens on an unparalleled scale compared to other fields. These combined features make biology uniquely suited to both benefit greatly from ML and serve as a profound wellspring of inspiration for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Taking a somewhat different tack, what problems in biology are still really resistant to our current tool set? Are there areas, perhaps specific challenges in disease or in wellness, which you feel are ripe for problem-solving?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable success in predictive tasks across domains such as image classification, natural language processing, and clinical risk modeling. However, in the biological sciences, predictive accuracy is often insufficient. The fundamental questions in these fields are inherently causal: How does a perturbation to a specific gene or pathway affect downstream cellular processes? What is the mechanism by which an intervention leads to a phenotypic change? Traditional machine learning models, which are primarily optimized for capturing statistical associations in observational data, often fail to answer such interventional queries.There is a strong need for biology and medicine to also inspire new foundational developments in machine learning.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field is now equipped with high-throughput perturbation technologies — such as pooled CRISPR screens, single-cell transcriptomics, and spatial profiling — that generate rich datasets under systematic interventions. These data modalities naturally call for the development of models that go beyond pattern recognition to support causal inference, active experimental design, and representation learning in settings with complex, structured latent variables. From a mathematical perspective, this requires tackling core questions of identifiability, sample efficiency, and the integration of combinatorial, geometric, and probabilistic tools. I believe that addressing these challenges will not only unlock new insights into the mechanisms of cellular systems, but also push the theoretical boundaries of machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to foundation models, a consensus in the field is that we are still far from creating a holistic foundation model for biology across scales, similar to what ChatGPT represents in the language domain — a sort of digital organism capable of simulating all biological phenomena. While new foundation models emerge almost weekly, these models have thus far been specialized for a specific scale and question, and focus on one or a few modalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant progress has been made in predicting protein structures from their sequences. This success has highlighted the importance of iterative machine learning challenges, such as CASP (critical assessment of structure prediction), which have been instrumental in benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms for protein structure prediction and driving their improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Schmidt Center is organizing challenges to increase awareness in the ML field and make progress in the development of methods to solve causal prediction problems that are so critical for the biomedical sciences. With the increasing availability of single-gene perturbation data at the single-cell level,&amp;nbsp;I believe predicting the effect of single or combinatorial perturbations, and which perturbations could drive a desired phenotype, are solvable problems. With our Cell Perturbation Prediction Challenge (CPPC), we aim to provide the means to objectively test and benchmark algorithms for predicting the effect of new perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the field has made remarkable strides is disease diagnostic and patient triage. Machine learning algorithms can integrate different sources of patient information (data modalities), generate missing modalities, identify patterns that may be difficult for us to detect, and help stratify patients based on their disease risk. While we must remain cautious about potential biases in model predictions, the danger of models learning shortcuts instead of true correlations, and the risk of automation bias in clinical decision-making, I believe this is an area where machine learning is already having a significant impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: &lt;/strong&gt;Let’s talk about some of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ericandwendyschmidtcenter.org/news\"&gt;headlines coming out of the Schmidt Center&lt;/a&gt; recently. What current research do you think people should be particularly excited about, and why?&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;/strong&gt;In collaboration with Dr. Fei Chen at the Broad Institute, we have recently developed a method for the prediction of unseen proteins’ subcellular location, called PUPS. Many existing methods can only make predictions based on the specific protein and cell data on which they were trained. PUPS, however, combines a protein language model with an image in-painting model to utilize both protein sequences and cellular images. We demonstrate that the protein sequence input enables generalization to unseen proteins, and the cellular image input captures single-cell variability, enabling cell-type-specific predictions. The model learns how relevant each amino acid residue is for the predicted sub-cellular localization, and it can predict changes in localization due to mutations in the protein sequences. Since proteins’ function is strictly related to their subcellular localization, our predictions could provide insights into potential mechanisms of disease. In the future, we aim to extend this method to predict the localization of multiple proteins in a cell and possibly understand protein-protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with Professor G.V. Shivashankar, a long-time collaborator at ETH Zürich, we have previously shown how simple images of cells stained with fluorescent DNA-intercalating dyes to label the chromatin can yield a lot of information about the state and fate of a cell in health and disease, when combined with machine learning algorithms. Recently, we have furthered this observation and proved the deep link between chromatin organization and gene regulation by developing Image2Reg, a method that enables the prediction of unseen genetically or chemically perturbed genes from chromatin images. Image2Reg utilizes convolutional neural networks to learn an informative representation of the chromatin images of perturbed cells. It also employs a graph convolutional network to create a gene embedding that captures the regulatory effects of genes based on protein-protein interaction data, integrated with cell-type-specific transcriptomic data. Finally, it learns a map between the resulting physical and biochemical representation of cells, allowing us to predict the perturbed gene modules based on chromatin images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we recently finalized the development of a method for predicting the outcomes of unseen combinatorial gene perturbations and identifying the types of interactions occurring between the perturbed genes. MORPH can guide the design of the most informative perturbations for lab-in-a-loop experiments. Furthermore, the attention-based framework provably enables our method to identify causal relations among the genes, providing insights into the underlying gene regulatory programs. Finally, thanks to its modular structure, we can apply MORPH to perturbation data measured in various modalities, including not only transcriptomics, but also imaging. We are very excited about the potential of this method to enable the efficient exploration of the perturbation space to advance our understanding of cellular programs by bridging causal theory to important applications, with implications for both basic research and therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-caroline-uhler.jpg?itok=-Tnd3ZSd\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“The current landscape of machine learning presents a unique opportunity to address problems across different levels of biological organization, from proteins to organisms, due to a data revolution in biology and significant advancements in AI,” says Caroline Uhler. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Jiin Kang</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/interview\">Interview</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/faculty\">Faculty</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health\">Health sciences and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/genomics\">Genomics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cells\">Cells</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/proteins\">Proteins</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/dna\">DNA</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/crispr\">CRISPR</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT researchers develop AI tool to improve flu vaccine strain selection</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/vaxseer-ai-tool-to-improve-flu-vaccine-strain-selection-0828</link>\n  <description>VaxSeer uses machine learning to predict virus evolution and antigenicity, aiming to make vaccine selection more accurate and less reliant on guesswork.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:50:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/vaxseer-ai-tool-to-improve-flu-vaccine-strain-selection-0828</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Rachel Gordon | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-2ef4ad7e-7fff-c28e-41c1-d61ce18592ae\"&gt;Every year, global health experts are faced with a high-stakes decision: Which influenza strains should go into the next seasonal vaccine? The choice must be made months in advance, long before flu season even begins, and it can often feel like a race against the clock. If the selected strains match those that circulate, the vaccine will likely be highly effective. But if the prediction is off, protection can drop significantly, leading to (potentially preventable) illness and strain on health care systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;This challenge became even more familiar to scientists in the years during the Covid-19 pandemic. Think back to the time (and time and time again), when new variants emerged just as vaccines were being rolled out. Influenza behaves like a similar, rowdy cousin, mutating constantly and unpredictably. That makes it hard to stay ahead, and therefore harder to design vaccines that remain protective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To reduce this uncertainty, scientists at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and the MIT Abdul Latif Jameel Clinic for Machine Learning in Health set out to make vaccine selection more accurate and less reliant on guesswork. They created an AI system called VaxSeer, designed to predict dominant flu strains and identify the most protective vaccine candidates, months ahead of time. The tool uses deep learning models trained on decades of viral sequences and lab test results to simulate how the flu virus might evolve and how the vaccines will respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Traditional evolution models often analyze the effect of single amino acid mutations independently. “VaxSeer adopts a large protein language model to learn the relationship between dominance and the combinatorial effects of mutations,” explains Wenxian Shi, a PhD student in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, researcher at CSAIL, and lead author of a new paper on the work. “Unlike existing protein language models that assume a static distribution of viral variants, we model dynamic dominance shifts, making it better suited for rapidly evolving viruses like influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;An &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03917-y\"&gt;open-access report on the study&lt;/a&gt; was published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future of flu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;VaxSeer has two core prediction engines: one that estimates how likely each viral strain is to spread (dominance), and another that estimates how effectively a vaccine will neutralize that strain (antigenicity). Together, they produce a predicted coverage score: a forward-looking measure of how well a given vaccine is likely to perform against future viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The scale of the score could be from an infinite negative to 0. The closer the score to 0, the better the antigenic match of vaccine strains to the circulating viruses. (You can imagine it as the negative of some kind of “distance.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In a 10-year retrospective study, the researchers evaluated VaxSeer’s recommendations against those made by the World Health Organization (WHO) for two major flu subtypes: A/H3N2 and A/H1N1. For A/H3N2, VaxSeer’s choices outperformed the WHO’s in nine out of 10 seasons, based on retrospective empirical coverage scores (a surrogate metric of the vaccine effectiveness, calculated from the observed dominance from past seasons and experimental HI test results). The team used this to evaluate vaccine selections, as the effectiveness is only available for vaccines actually given to the population.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;For A/H1N1, it outperformed or matched the WHO in six out of 10 seasons. In one notable case, for the 2016 flu season, VaxSeer identified a strain that wasn’t chosen by the WHO until the following year. The model’s predictions also showed strong correlation with real-world vaccine effectiveness estimates, as reported by the CDC, Canada’s Sentinel Practitioner Surveillance Network, and Europe’s I-MOVE program. VaxSeer’s predicted coverage scores aligned closely with public health data on flu-related illnesses and medical visits prevented by vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;So how exactly does VaxSeer make sense of all these data? Intuitively, the model first estimates how rapidly a viral strain spreads over time using a protein language model, and then determines its dominance by accounting for competition among different strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Once the model has calculated its insights, they’re plugged into a mathematical framework based on something called ordinary differential equations to simulate viral spread over time. For antigenicity, the system estimates how well a given vaccine strain will perform in a common lab test called the hemagglutination inhibition assay. This measures how effectively antibodies can&amp;nbsp;inhibit the virus from binding to human red blood cells, which is a widely used proxy for antigenic match/antigenicity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outpacing evolution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“By modeling how viruses evolve and how vaccines interact with them, AI tools like VaxSeer could help health officials make better, faster decisions — and stay one step ahead in the race between infection and immunity,” says Shi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;VaxSeer currently focuses only on the flu virus’s HA (hemagglutinin) protein,the major antigen of influenza. Future versions could incorporate other proteins like NA (neuraminidase), and factors like immune history, manufacturing constraints, or dosage levels. Applying the system to other viruses would also require large, high-quality datasets that track both viral evolution and immune responses — data that aren’t always publicly available. The team, however is currently working on the methods that can predict viral evolution in low-data regimes building on relations between viral families&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Given the speed of viral evolution, current therapeutic development often lags behind.&amp;nbsp;VaxSeer is our attempt to catch up,” says Regina Barzilay, the School of Engineering Distinguished Professor for AI and Health at MIT, AI lead of Jameel Clinic, and CSAIL principal investigator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“This paper is impressive, but what excites me perhaps even more is the team’s ongoing work on predicting viral evolution in low-data settings,” says Assistant Professor Jon Stokes of the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “The implications go far beyond influenza. Imagine being able to anticipate how antibiotic-resistant bacteria or drug-resistant cancers might evolve, both of which can adapt rapidly. This kind of predictive modeling opens up a powerful new way of thinking about how diseases change, giving us the opportunity to stay one step ahead and design clinical interventions before escape becomes a major problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Shi and Barzilay wrote the paper with MIT CSAIL postdoc Jeremy Wohlwend ’16, MEng ’17, PhD ’25 and recent CSAIL affiliate Menghua Wu ’19, MEng ’20, PhD ’25.

This could lead someone to believe a deep-learning model makes more accurate predictions when that is not the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers developed a more robust way of evaluating these techniques, which shows that, while simple models are more accurate when estimating regional surface temperatures, deep-learning approaches can be the best choice for estimating local rainfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used these results to enhance a simulation tool known as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://bc3.mit.edu/demos/en-roads/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;climate emulator&lt;/a&gt;, which can rapidly simulate the effect of human activities onto a future climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers see their work as a “cautionary tale” about the risk of deploying large AI models for climate science. While deep-learning models have shown incredible success in domains such as natural language, climate science contains a proven set of physical laws and approximations, and the challenge becomes how to incorporate those into AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are trying to develop models that are going to be useful and relevant for the kinds of things that decision-makers need going forward when making climate policy choices. While it might be attractive to use the latest, big-picture machine-learning model on a climate problem, what this study shows is that stepping back and really thinking about the problem fundamentals is important and useful,” says study senior author Noelle Selin, a professor in the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), and director of the Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selin’s co-authors are lead author Björn Lütjens, a former EAPS postdoc who is now a research scientist at IBM Research; senior author Raffaele Ferrari, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Oceanography in EAPS and co-director of the Lorenz Center; and Duncan Watson-Parris, assistant professor at the University of California at San Diego. Selin and Ferrari are also co-principal investigators of the &lt;a href=\"https://climategrandchallenges.mit.edu/flagship-projects/bringing-computation-to-the-climate-challenge/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge&lt;/a&gt; project, out of which this research emerged. The &lt;a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2024MS004619\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; appears today in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing emulators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the Earth’s climate is so complex, running a state-of-the-art climate model to predict how pollution levels will impact environmental factors like temperature can take weeks on the world’s most powerful supercomputers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists often create climate emulators, simpler approximations of a state-of-the art climate model, which are faster and more accessible. A policymaker could use a climate emulator to see how alternative assumptions on greenhouse gas emissions would affect future temperatures, helping them develop regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But an emulator isn’t very useful if it makes inaccurate predictions about the local impacts of climate change. While deep learning has become increasingly popular for emulation, few studies have explored whether these models perform better than tried-and-true approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers performed such a study. They compared a traditional technique called linear pattern scaling (LPS) with a deep-learning model using a common benchmark dataset for evaluating climate emulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results showed that LPS outperformed deep-learning models on predicting nearly all parameters they tested, including temperature and precipitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Large AI methods are very appealing to scientists, but they rarely solve a completely new problem, so implementing an existing solution first is necessary to find out whether the complex machine-learning approach actually improves upon it,” says Lütjens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some initial results seemed to fly in the face of the researchers’ domain knowledge. The powerful deep-learning model should have been more accurate when making predictions about precipitation, since those data don’t follow a linear pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that the high amount of natural variability in climate model runs can cause the deep learning model to perform poorly on unpredictable long-term oscillations, like El Niño/La Niña. This skews the benchmarking scores in favor of LPS, which averages out those oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructing a new evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, the researchers constructed a new evaluation with more data that address natural climate variability. With this new evaluation, the deep-learning model performed slightly better than LPS for local precipitation, but LPS was still more accurate for temperature predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to use the modeling tool that is right for the problem, but in order to do that you also have to set up the problem the right way in the first place,” Selin says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on these results, the researchers incorporated LPS into a climate emulation platform to predict local temperature changes in different emission scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are not advocating that LPS should always be the goal. It still has limitations. For instance, LPS doesn’t predict variability or extreme weather events,”&amp;nbsp;Ferrari adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather, they hope their results emphasize the need to develop better benchmarking techniques, which could provide a fuller picture of which climate emulation technique is best suited for a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With an improved climate emulation benchmark, we could use more complex machine-learning methods to explore problems that are currently very hard to address, like the impacts of aerosols or estimations of extreme precipitation,” Lütjens says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, more accurate benchmarking techniques will help ensure policymakers are making decisions based on the best available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope others build on their analysis, perhaps by studying additional improvements to climate emulation methods and benchmarks. Such research could explore impact-oriented metrics like drought indicators and wildfire risks, or new variables like regional wind speeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by Schmidt Sciences, LLC, and is part of the MIT Climate Grand Challenges team for “Bringing Computation to the Climate Challenge.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Climate-Emulators-01-press.jpg?itok=EtBcQ0D-\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Simple climate prediction models can outperform deep-learning approaches when predicting future temperature changes, but deep learning has potential for estimating more complex variables like rainfall, according to an MIT study.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pollution\">Pollution</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/public-health\">Public health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/earth-atmosphere\">Earth and atmospheric sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/eaps\">EAPS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New technologies tackle brain health assessment for the military</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technologies-tackle-brain-health-assessment-for-military-0825</link>\n  <description>Tools build on years of research at Lincoln Laboratory to develop a rapid brain health screening capability and may also be applicable to civilian settings such as sporting events and medical offices.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-technologies-tackle-brain-health-assessment-for-military-0825</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne McGovern | MIT Lincoln Laboratory</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive readiness denotes a person's ability to respond and adapt to the changes around them. This includes functions like keeping balance after tripping, or making the right decision in a challenging situation based on knowledge and past experiences. For military service members, cognitive readiness is crucial for their health and safety, as well as mission success. Injury to the brain is a major contributor to cognitive impairment, and between 2000 and 2024,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Centers-of-Excellence/Traumatic-Brain-Injury-Center-of-Excellence/DOD-TBI-Worldwide-Numbers\"&gt;more than 500,000&lt;/a&gt; military service members were diagnosed with traumatic brain injury (TBI) — caused by anything from a fall during training to blast exposure on the battlefield. While impairment from factors like sleep deprivation can be treated through rest and recovery, others caused by injury may require more intense and prolonged medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"Current cognitive readiness tests administered to service members lack the sensitivity to detect subtle shifts in cognitive performance that may occur in individuals exposed to operational hazards,\" says Christopher Smalt, a researcher in the laboratory's &lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/biotechnology-and-human-systems/human-health-and-performance-systems\"&gt;Human Health and Performance Systems Group.&lt;/a&gt; \"Unfortunately, the cumulative effects of these exposures are often not well-documented during military service or after transition to Veterans Affairs, making it challenging to provide effective support.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smalt is part of a team at the laboratory developing a suite of portable diagnostic tests that provide near-real-time screening for brain injury and cognitive health. One of these tools, called READY, is a smartphone or tablet app that helps identify a potential change in cognitive performance in less than 90 seconds. Another tool, called MINDSCAPE — which is being developed in collaboration with Richard Fletcher, a visiting scientist in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/r-d/engineering/rapid-prototyping\"&gt;Rapid Prototyping Group&lt;/a&gt; who leads the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://mobilehealthlab.com/\"&gt;Mobile Technology Lab&lt;/a&gt; at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://autoid.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Auto-ID Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;, and his students — uses virtual reality (VR) technology for a more in-depth analysis to pinpoint specific conditions such as TBI, post-traumatic stress disorder, or sleep deprivation. Using these tests, medical personnel on the battlefield can make quick and effective decisions for treatment triage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both READY and MINDSCAPE are a response to a series of Congressional legislation mandates, military program requirements, and mission-driven health needs to improve brain health screening capabilities for service members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive readiness biomarkers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The READY and MINDSCAPE platforms incorporate more than a decade of laboratory research on finding the right indicators of cognitive readiness to build into rapid testing applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/biographies/thomas-f-quatieri\"&gt;Thomas Quatieri&lt;/a&gt; oversaw this work and identified balance, eye movement, and speech as three reliable biomarkers. He is leading the effort at Lincoln Laboratory to develop READY.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"READY stands for Rapid Evaluation of Attention for DutY, and is built on the premise that attention is the key to being 'ready' for a mission,\" he says. \"In one view, we can think of attention as the mental state that allows you to focus on a task.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For someone to be attentive, their brain must continuously anticipate and process incoming sensory information and then instruct the body to respond appropriately. For example, if a friend yells \"catch\" and then throws a ball in your direction, in order to catch that ball, your brain must process the incoming auditory and visual data, predict in advance what may happen in the next few moments, and then direct your body to respond with an action that synchronizes those sensory data. The result? You realize from hearing the word \"catch\" and seeing the moving ball that your friend is throwing the ball to you, and you reach out a hand to catch it just in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"An unhealthy or fatigued brain — caused by TBI or sleep deprivation, for example — may have challenges within a neurosensory feed-forward [prediction] or feedback [error] system, thus hampering the person's ability to attend,\" Quatieri says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READY's three tests measure a person’s ability to track a moving dot with their eye, balance, and hold a vowel fixed at one pitch. The app then uses the data to calculate a variability or \"wobble\" indicator, which represents changes from the test taker's baseline or from expected results based on others with similar demographics, or the general population. The results are displayed to the user as an indication of the patient's level of attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the READY screen shows an impairment, the administrator can then direct the subject to follow up with MINDSCAPE, which stands for Mobile Interface for Neurological Diagnostic Situational Cognitive Assessment and Psychological Evaluation. MINDSCAPE uses VR technology to administer additional, in-depth tests to measure cognitive functions such as reaction time and working memory. These standard neurocognitive tests are recorded with multimodal physiological sensors, such as electroencephalography (EEG), photoplethysmography, and pupillometry, to better pinpoint diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic and adaptable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key advantage of READY and MINDSCAPE is their ability to leverage existing technologies, allowing for rapid deployment in the field. By utilizing sensors and capabilities already integrated into smartphones, tablets, and VR devices, these assessment tools can be easily adapted for use in operational settings at a significantly reduced cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"We can immediately apply our advanced algorithms to the data collected from these devices, without the need for costly and time-consuming hardware development,\" Smalt says. \"By harnessing the capabilities of commercially available technologies, we can quickly provide valuable insights and improve upon traditional assessment methods.\"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing new capabilities and AI for brain-health sensing into operational environments is a theme across several projects at the laboratory. Another example is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.ll.mit.edu/news/fifteen-lincoln-laboratory-technologies-receive-rd-100-awards\"&gt;EYEBOOM&lt;/a&gt; (Electrooculography and Balance Blast Overpressure Monitoring System), a wearable technology developed for the U.S. Special Forces to monitor blast exposure. EYEBOOM continuously monitors a wearer's eye and body movements as they experience blast energy, and warns of potential harm. For this program, the laboratory developed an algorithm that could identify a potential change in physiology resulting from blast exposure during operations, rather than waiting for a check-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three technologies are in development to be versatile, so they can be adapted for other relevant uses. For example, a workflow could pair EYEBOOM's monitoring capabilities with the READY and MINDSCAPE tests: EYEBOOM would continuously monitor for exposure risk and then prompt the wearer to seek additional assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\"A lot of times, research focuses on one specific modality, whereas what we do at the laboratory is search for a holistic solution that can be applied for many different purposes,\" Smalt says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINDSCAPE is undergoing testing at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://walterreed.tricare.mil/\"&gt;Walter Reed National Military Center&lt;/a&gt; this year. READY will be tested with the&amp;nbsp;U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine (USARIEM) in 2026 in the context of sleep deprivation. Smalt and Quatieri also see the technologies finding use in civilian settings — on sporting event sidelines, in doctors' offices, or wherever else there is a need to assess brain readiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MINDSCAPE is being developed with clinical validation and support from Stefanie Kuchinsky at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. Quatieri and his team are developing the READY tests in collaboration with Jun Maruta and Jam Ghajar from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://braintrauma.org/\"&gt;Brain Trauma Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (BTF), and Kristin Heaton from USARIEM. The tests are supported by concurrent evidence-based guidelines lead by the BTF and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://mtbi2.usuhs.edu/\"&gt;Military TBI Initiative&lt;/a&gt; at Uniform Services University.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-lincoln-Brain-Health-Military.jpg?itok=gtPYkumz\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Lincoln Laboratory researchers are building rapid brain health screening capabilities for military service members.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Tammy Ko/Lincoln Laboratory</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/brain-cognitive\">Brain and cognitive sciences</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/neuroscience\">Neuroscience</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/diagnostic-devices\">Diagnostic devices</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biomedical-sensors\">Biomedical sensors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/augmented-and-virtual-reality\">Augmented and virtual reality</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/security-studies\">Security studies and military</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mobile-applications\">Mobile applications</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/invention\">Invention</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health-care\">Health care</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sports\">Sports and fitness</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lincoln-laboratory-0\">Lincoln Laboratory</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Can large language models figure out the real world?</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-large-language-models-figure-out-real-world-0825</link>\n  <description>New test could help determine if AI systems that make accurate predictions in one area can understand it well enough to apply that ability to a different area.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 25 Aug 2025 16:30:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/can-large-language-models-figure-out-real-world-0825</guid>\n        <dc:creator>David Chandler | Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in the 17th century, German astronomer Johannes Kepler figured out the laws of motion that made it possible to accurately predict where our solar system’s planets would appear in the sky as they orbit the sun. But it wasn’t until decades later, when Isaac Newton formulated the universal laws of gravitation, that the underlying principles were understood. Although they were inspired by Kepler’s laws, they went much further, and made it possible to apply the same formulas to everything from the trajectory of a cannon ball to the way the moon’s pull controls the tides on Earth — or how to launch a satellite from Earth to the surface of the moon or planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today’s sophisticated artificial intelligence systems have gotten very good at making the kind of specific predictions that resemble Kepler’s orbit predictions. But do they know why these predictions work, with the kind of deep understanding that comes from basic principles like Newton’s laws? As the world grows ever-more dependent on these kinds of AI systems, researchers are struggling to try to measure just how they do what they do, and how deep their understanding of the real world actually is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers in MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) and at Harvard University have devised a new approach to assessing how deeply these predictive systems understand their subject matter, and whether they can apply knowledge from one domain to a slightly different one. And by and large the answer at this point, in the examples they studied, is — not so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://icml.cc/virtual/2025/poster/44374\"&gt;findings were presented&lt;/a&gt; at the International Conference on Machine Learning, in Vancouver, British Columbia, last month by Harvard postdoc Keyon Vafa, MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and LIDS affiliate Peter G. Chang, MIT assistant professor and LIDS principal investigator Ashesh Rambachan, and MIT professor, LIDS principal investigator, and senior author Sendhil Mullainathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Humans all the time have been able to make this transition from good predictions to world models,” says Vafa, the study’s lead author. So the question their team was addressing was, “have foundation models — has AI — been able to make that leap from predictions to world models? And we’re not asking are they capable, or can they, or will they. It’s just, have they done it so far?” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know how to test whether an algorithm predicts well. But what we need is a way to test for whether it has understood well,” says Mullainathan, the Peter de Florez Professor with dual appointments in the MIT departments of Economics and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the senior author on the study. “Even defining what understanding means was a challenge.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Kepler versus Newton analogy, Vafa says, “they both had models that worked really well on one task, and that worked essentially the same way on that task. What Newton offered was ideas that were able to generalize to new tasks.” That capability, when applied to the predictions made by various AI systems, would entail having it develop a world model so it can “transcend the task that you’re working on and be able to generalize to new kinds of problems and paradigms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another analogy that helps to illustrate the point is the difference between centuries of accumulated knowledge of how to selectively breed crops and animals, versus Gregor Mendel’s insight into the underlying laws of genetic inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of excitement in the field about using foundation models to not just perform tasks, but to learn something about the world,” for example in the natural sciences, he says. “It would need to adapt, have a world model to adapt to any possible task.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are AI systems anywhere near the ability to reach such generalizations? To test the question, the team looked at different examples of predictive AI systems, at different levels of complexity. On the very simplest of examples, the systems succeeded in creating a realistic model of the simulated system, but as the examples got more complex that ability faded fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team developed a new metric, a way of measuring quantitatively how well a system approximates real-world conditions. They call the measurement inductive bias — that is, a tendency or bias toward responses that reflect reality, based on inferences developed from looking at vast amounts of data on specific cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The simplest level of examples they looked at was known as a lattice model. In a one-dimensional lattice, something can move only along a line. Vafa compares it to a frog jumping between lily pads in a row. As the frog jumps or sits, it calls out what it’s doing — right, left, or stay. If it reaches the last lily pad in the row, it can only stay or go back. If someone, or an AI system, can just hear the calls, without knowing anything about the number of lily pads, can it figure out the configuration? The answer is yes: Predictive models do well at reconstructing the “world” in such a simple case. But even with lattices, as you increase the number of dimensions, the systems no longer can make that leap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, in a two-state or three-state lattice, we showed that the model does have a pretty good inductive bias toward the actual state,” says Chang. “But as we increase the number of states, then it starts to have a divergence from real-world models.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more complex problem is a system that can play the board game Othello, which involves players alternately placing black or white disks on a grid. The AI models can accurately predict what moves are allowable at a given point, but it turns out they do badly at inferring what the overall arrangement of pieces on the board is, including ones that are currently blocked from play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team then looked at five different categories of predictive models actually in use, and again, the more complex the systems involved, the more poorly the predictive modes performed at matching the true underlying world model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new metric of inductive bias, “our hope is to provide a kind of test bed where you can evaluate different models, different training approaches, on problems where we know what the true world model is,” Vafa says. If it performs well on these cases where we already know the underlying reality, then we can have greater faith that its predictions may be useful even in cases “where we don’t really know what the truth is,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are already trying to use these kinds of predictive AI systems to aid in scientific discovery, including such things as properties of chemical compounds that have never actually been created, or of potential pharmaceutical compounds, or for predicting the folding behavior and properties of unknown protein molecules. “For the more realistic problems,” Vafa says, “even for something like basic mechanics, we found that there seems to be a long way to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang says, “There’s been a lot of hype around foundation models, where people are trying to build domain-specific foundation models — biology-based foundation models, physics-based foundation models, robotics foundation models, foundation models for other types of domains where people have been collecting a ton of data” and training these models to make predictions, “and then hoping that it acquires some knowledge of the domain itself, to be used for other downstream tasks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work shows there’s a long way to go, but it also helps to show a path forward. “Our paper suggests that we can apply our metrics to evaluate how much the representation is learning, so that we can come up with better ways of training foundation models, or at least evaluate the models that we’re training currently,” Chang says. “As an engineering field, once we have a metric for something, people are really, really good at optimizing that metric.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/Foundation-models.jpg?itok=IXXXhTI8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Researchers at MIT and Harvard University have devised a new approach to assessing how deeply predictive AI systems understand their subject matter, and whether they can apply knowledge from one domain to a slightly different one. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/economics\">Economics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A new model predicts how molecules will dissolve in different solvents</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819</link>\n  <description>Solubility predictions could make it easier to design and synthesize new drugs, while minimizing the use of more hazardous solvents.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 19 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-model-predicts-how-molecules-will-dissolve-in-different-solvents-0819</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using machine learning, MIT chemical engineers have created a computational model that can predict how well any given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent — a key step in the synthesis of nearly any pharmaceutical. This type of prediction could make it much easier to develop new ways to produce drugs and other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model, which predicts how much of a solute will dissolve in a particular solvent, should help chemists to choose the right solvent for any given reaction in their synthesis, the researchers say. Common organic solvents include ethanol and acetone, and there are hundreds of others that can also be used in chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Predicting solubility really is a rate-limiting step in synthetic planning and manufacturing of chemicals, especially drugs, so there’s been a longstanding interest in being able to make better predictions of solubility,” says Lucas Attia, an MIT graduate student and one of the lead authors of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have made their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://askcos.mit.edu/solprop?tab=solpred\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; freely available, and many companies and labs have already started using it. The model could be particularly useful for identifying solvents that are less hazardous than some of the most commonly used industrial solvents, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are some solvents which are known to dissolve most things. They’re really useful, but they’re damaging to the environment, and they’re damaging to people, so many companies require that you have to minimize the amount of those solvents that you use,” says Jackson Burns, an MIT graduate student who is also a lead author of the paper. “Our model is extremely useful in being able to identify the next-best solvent, which is hopefully much less damaging to the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Green, the Hoyt Hottel Professor of Chemical Engineering and director of the MIT Energy Initiative, is the senior author of the &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-62717-7\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears today in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. Patrick Doyle, the Robert T. Haslam Professor of Chemical Engineering, is also an author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving solubility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model grew out of a project that Attia and Burns worked on together in an MIT course&amp;nbsp;on applying machine learning to chemical engineering problems. Traditionally, chemists have predicted solubility with a tool known as the Abraham Solvation Model, which can be used to estimate a molecule’s overall solubility by adding up the contributions of chemical structures within the molecule. While these predictions are useful, their accuracy is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, researchers have begun using machine learning to try to make more accurate solubility predictions. Before Burns and Attia began working on their new model, the state-of-the-art model for predicting solubility was a model developed in Green’s lab in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That model, known as SolProp, works by predicting a set of related properties and combining them, using thermodynamics, to ultimately predict the solubility. However, the model has difficulty predicting solubility for solutes that it hasn’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For drug and chemical discovery pipelines where you’re developing a new molecule, you want to be able to predict ahead of time what its solubility looks like,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the reason that existing solubility models haven’t worked well is because there wasn’t a comprehensive dataset to train them on. However, in 2023 a new dataset called BigSolDB was released, which compiled data from nearly 800 published papers, including information on solubility for about 800 molecules dissolved about more than 100 organic solvents that are commonly used in synthetic chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attia and Burns decided to try training two different types of models on this data. Both of these models represent the chemical structures of molecules using numerical representations known as embeddings, which incorporate information such as the number of atoms in a molecule and which atoms are bound to which other atoms. Models can then use these representations to predict a variety of chemical properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the models used in this study, known as FastProp and developed by Burns and others in Green’s lab, incorporates “static embeddings.” This means that the model already knows the embedding for each molecule before it starts doing any kind of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other model, ChemProp, learns an embedding for each molecule during the training, at the same time that it learns to associate the features of the embedding with a trait such as solubility. This model, developed across multiple MIT labs, has already been used for tasks such as antibiotic discovery, lipid nanoparticle design, and predicting chemical reaction rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers trained both types of models on over 40,000 data points from BigSolDB, including information on the effects of temperature, which plays a significant role in solubility. Then, they tested the models on about 1,000 solutes that had been withheld from the training data. They found that the models’ predictions were two to three times more accurate than those of SolProp, the previous best model, and the new models were especially accurate at predicting variations in solubility due to temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Being able to accurately reproduce those small variations in solubility due to temperature, even when the overarching experimental noise is very large, was a really positive sign that the network had correctly learned an underlying solubility prediction function,” Burns says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accurate predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers had expected that the model based on ChemProp, which is able to learn new representations as it goes along, would be able to make more accurate predictions. However, to their surprise, they found that the two models performed essentially the same. That suggests that the main limitation on their performance is the quality of the data, and that the models are performing as well as theoretically possible based on the data that they’re using, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ChemProp should always outperform any static embedding when you have sufficient data,” Burns says. “We were blown away to see that the static and learned embeddings were statistically indistinguishable in performance across all the different subsets, which indicates to us that that the data limitations that are present in this space dominated the model performance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The models could become more accurate, the researchers say, if better training and testing data were available — ideally, data obtained by one person or a group of people all trained to perform the experiments the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the big limitations of using these kinds of compiled datasets is that different labs use different methods and experimental conditions when they perform solubility tests. That contributes to this variability between different datasets,” Attia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the model based on FastProp makes its predictions faster and has code that is easier for other users to adapt, the researchers decided to make that one, known as FastSolv, available to the public. Multiple pharmaceutical companies have already begun using it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are applications throughout the drug discovery pipeline,” Burns says.&amp;nbsp;“We’re also excited to see, outside of formulation and drug discovery, where people may use this model.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Predict-Solubility-01-press.jpg?itok=NlJyl9z7\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT chemical engineers created a computational model that can predict how well a given molecule will dissolve in an organic solvent.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the researchers; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-development\">Drug development</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pharmaceuticals\">Pharmaceuticals</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemistry-0\">Chemistry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cleaner-industry\">Cleaner industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Researchers glimpse the inner workings of protein language models</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-glimpse-inner-workings-protein-language-models-0818</link>\n  <description>A new approach can reveal the features AI models use to predict proteins that might make good drug or vaccine targets.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/researchers-glimpse-inner-workings-protein-language-models-0818</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Within the past few years, models that can predict the structure or function of proteins have been widely used for a variety of biological applications, such as identifying drug targets and designing new therapeutic antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These models, which are based on large language models (LLMs), can make very accurate predictions of a protein’s suitability for a given application. However, there’s no way to determine how these models make their predictions or which protein features play the most important role in those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, MIT researchers have used a novel technique to open up that “black box” and allow them to determine what features a protein language model takes into account when making predictions. Understanding what is happening inside that black box&amp;nbsp;could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our work has broad implications for enhanced explainability in downstream tasks that rely on these representations,” says Bonnie Berger, the Simons Professor of Mathematics, head of the Computation and Biology group in MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and the senior author of the study. “Additionally, identifying features that protein language models track has the potential to reveal novel biological insights from these representations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onkar Gujral, an MIT graduate student, is the lead author of the open-access &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2506316122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, which appears this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/em&gt; Mihir Bafna, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, and Eric Alm, an MIT professor of biological engineering, are also authors of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opening the black box&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Berger and former MIT graduate student Tristan Bepler PhD ’20 &lt;a href=\"https://openreview.net/revisions?id=SygLehCqtm\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;introduced&lt;/a&gt; the first protein language model. Their model, like subsequent protein models that accelerated the development of&amp;nbsp;AlphaFold, such as&amp;nbsp;ESM2 and OmegaFold, was based on LLMs. These models, which include ChatGPT, can analyze huge amounts of text and figure out which words are most likely to appear together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein language models use a similar approach, but instead of analyzing words, they analyze amino acid sequences. Researchers have used these models to predict the structure and function of proteins, and for applications such as identifying proteins that might bind to particular drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2021/model-viruses-escape-immune-0114\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, Berger and colleagues used a protein language model to predict which sections of viral surface proteins are less likely to mutate in a way that enables viral escape. This allowed them to identify possible targets for vaccines against influenza, HIV, and SARS-CoV-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in all of these studies, it has been impossible to know how the models were making their predictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would get out some prediction at the end, but we had absolutely no idea what was happening in the individual components of this black box,” Berger says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers wanted to dig into how protein language models make their predictions. Just like LLMs, protein language models encode information as representations that consist of a pattern of activation of different “nodes” within a neural network. These nodes are analogous to the networks of neurons that store memories and other information within the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inner workings of LLMs are not easy to interpret, but within the past couple of years, researchers have begun using a type of algorithm known as a sparse autoencoder to help shed some light on how those models make their predictions. The new study from Berger’s lab is the first to use this algorithm on protein language models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sparse autoencoders work by adjusting how a protein is represented within a neural network. Typically, a given protein will be represented by a pattern of activation of a constrained number of neurons, for example, 480. A sparse autoencoder will expand that representation into a much larger number of nodes, say 20,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When information about a protein is encoded by only 480 neurons, each node lights up for multiple features, making it very difficult to know what features each node is encoding. However, when the neural network is expanded to 20,000 nodes, this extra space along with a sparsity constraint gives the information room to “spread out.” Now, a feature of the protein that was previously encoded by multiple nodes can occupy a single node.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a sparse representation, the neurons lighting up are doing so in a more meaningful manner,” Gujral says. “Before the sparse representations are created, the networks pack information so tightly together that it's hard to interpret the neurons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interpretable models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers obtained sparse representations of many proteins, they used an AI assistant called Claude (related to the popular Anthropic chatbot of the same name), to analyze the representations. In this case, they asked Claude to compare the sparse representations with the known features of each protein, such as molecular function, protein family, or location within a cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analyzing thousands of representations, Claude can determine which nodes correspond to specific protein features, then describe them in plain English. For example, the algorithm might say, “This neuron appears to be detecting proteins involved in transmembrane transport of ions or amino acids, particularly those located in the plasma membrane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This process makes the nodes far more “interpretable,” meaning the researchers can tell what each node is encoding. They found that the features most likely to be encoded by these nodes were protein family and certain functions, including several different metabolic and biosynthetic processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you train a sparse autoencoder, you aren’t training it to be interpretable, but it turns out that by incentivizing the representation to be really sparse, that ends up resulting in interpretability,” Gujral says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what features a particular protein model is encoding could help researchers choose the right model for a particular task, or tweak the type of input they give the model, to generate the best results. Additionally, analyzing the features that a model encodes could one day help biologists to learn more about the proteins that they are studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point when the models get a lot more powerful, you could learn more biology than you already know, from opening up the models,” Gujral says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-model-interpret-01-press.jpg?itok=nA-s3rBF\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Understanding what is happening inside the “black box” of large protein models could help researchers to choose better models for a particular task, helping to streamline the process of identifying new drugs or vaccine targets.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/proteins\">Proteins</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-discovery\">Drug discovery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-science\">School of Science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>How AI could speed the development of RNA vaccines and other RNA therapies</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-ai-could-speed-development-rna-vaccines-and-other-rna-therapies-0815</link>\n  <description>MIT engineers used a machine-learning model to design nanoparticles that can deliver RNA to cells more efficiently.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2025 05:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/how-ai-could-speed-development-rna-vaccines-and-other-rna-therapies-0815</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have come up with a new way to design nanoparticles that can more efficiently deliver RNA vaccines and other types of RNA therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After training a machine-learning model to analyze thousands of existing delivery particles, the researchers used it to predict new materials that would work even better. The model also enabled the researchers to identify particles that would work well in different types of cells, and to discover ways to incorporate new types of materials into the particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we did was apply machine-learning tools to help accelerate the identification of optimal ingredient mixtures in lipid nanoparticles to help target a different cell type or help incorporate different materials, much faster than previously was possible,” says Giovanni Traverso,&amp;nbsp;an associate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital,&amp;nbsp;and the senior author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could dramatically speed the process of developing new RNA vaccines, as well as therapies that could be used to treat obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic disorders, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvin Chan, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at Nanyang Technological University, and Ameya Kirtane, a former MIT postdoc who is now an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota, are the lead authors of the new open-access study, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41565-025-01975-4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Nanotechnology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Particle predictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RNA vaccines, such as the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, are usually packaged in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for delivery. These particles protect mRNA from being broken down in the body and help it to enter cells once injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating particles that handle these jobs more efficiently could help researchers to develop even more effective vaccines. Better delivery vehicles could also make it easier to develop mRNA therapies that encode genes for proteins that could help to treat a variety of diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Traverso’s lab launched a multiyear&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2024/mit-led-team-receives-funding-new-treatments-metabolic-disease-0205\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;research program&lt;/a&gt;, funded by the U.S. Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), to develop new ingestible devices that could achieve oral delivery of RNA treatments and vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of what we’re trying to do is develop ways of producing more protein, for example, for therapeutic applications. Maximizing the efficiency is important to be able to boost how much we can have the cells produce,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical LNP consists of four components — a cholesterol, a helper lipid, an ionizable lipid, and a lipid that is attached to polyethylene glycol (PEG). Different variants of each of these components can be swapped in to create a huge number of possible combinations. Changing up these formulations and testing each one individually is very time-consuming, so Traverso, Chan, and their colleagues decided to turn to artificial intelligence to help speed up the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most AI models in drug discovery focus on optimizing a single compound at a time, but that approach doesn’t work for lipid nanoparticles, which are made of multiple interacting components,” Chan says. “To tackle this, we developed a new model called COMET, inspired by the same transformer architecture that powers large language models like ChatGPT. Just as those models understand how words combine to form meaning, COMET learns how different chemical components come together in a nanoparticle to influence its properties — like how well it can deliver RNA into cells.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To generate training data for their machine-learning model, the researchers created a library of about 3,000 different LNP formulations. The team tested each of these 3,000 particles in the lab to see how efficiently they could deliver their payload to cells, then fed all of this data into a machine-learning model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the model was trained, the researchers asked it to predict new formulations that would work better than existing LNPs. They tested those predictions by using the new formulations to deliver mRNA encoding a fluorescent protein to mouse skin cells grown in a lab dish. They found that the LNPs predicted by the model did indeed work better than the particles in the training data, and in some cases better than LNP formulations that are used commercially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerated development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers showed that the model could accurately predict particles that would efficiently deliver mRNA, they began asking additional questions. First, they wondered if they could train the model on nanoparticles that incorporate a fifth component: a type of polymer known as branched poly beta amino esters (PBAEs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by Traverso and his colleagues has shown that these polymers can effectively deliver nucleic acids on their own, so they wanted to explore whether adding them to LNPs could improve LNP performance. The MIT team created a set of about 300 LNPs that also include these polymers, which they used to train the model. The resulting model could then predict additional formulations with PBAEs that would work better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers set out to train the model to make predictions about LNPs that would work best in different types of cells, including a type of cell called Caco-2, which is derived from colorectal cancer cells. Again, the model was able to predict LNPs that would efficiently deliver mRNA to these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the researchers used the model to predict which LNPs could best withstand lyophilization — a freeze-drying process often used to extend the shelf-life of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a tool that allows us to adapt it to a whole different set of questions and help accelerate development. We did a large training set that went into the model, but then you can do much more focused experiments and get outputs that are helpful on very different kinds of questions,” Traverso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues are now working on incorporating some of these particles into potential treatments for diabetes and obesity, which are two of the primary targets of the ARPA-H funded project. Therapeutics that could be delivered using this approach include GLP-1 mimics with similar effects to Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by the GO Nano Marble Center at the Koch Institute, the Karl van Tassel Career Development Professorship, the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and ARPA-H.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-AI-Nanoparticles-01-press.jpg?itok=s93vqVvn\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“What we did was apply machine-learning tools to help accelerate the identification of optimal ingredient mixtures in lipid nanoparticles to help target a different cell type or help incorporate different materials, much faster than previously was possible,” says Giovanni Traverso.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: Courtesy of the researchers; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/rna\">RNA</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/vaccines\">Vaccines</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-delivery\">Drug delivery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-discovery\">Drug discovery</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Using generative AI, researchers design compounds that can kill drug-resistant bacteria</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/using-generative-ai-researchers-design-compounds-kill-drug-resistant-bacteria-0814</link>\n  <description>The team used two different AI approaches to design novel antibiotics, including one that showed promise against MRSA.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2025 11:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/using-generative-ai-researchers-design-compounds-kill-drug-resistant-bacteria-0814</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Anne Trafton | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have designed novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; and multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;(MRSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using generative AI algorithms, the research team designed more than 36 million possible compounds and computationally screened them for antimicrobial properties. The top candidates they discovered are structurally distinct from any existing antibiotics, and they appear to work by novel mechanisms that disrupt bacterial cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach allowed the researchers to generate and evaluate theoretical compounds that have never been seen before — a strategy that they now hope to apply to identify and design compounds with activity against other species of bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the new possibilities that this project opens up for antibiotics development. Our work shows the power of AI from a drug design standpoint, and enables us to exploit much larger chemical spaces that were previously inaccessible,” says James Collins,&amp;nbsp;the Termeer Professor of Medical Engineering and Science in MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) and Department of Biological Engineering, and a member of the Broad Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins is the senior author of the study, which &lt;a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00855-4\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears today&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. The paper’s lead authors are MIT postdoc Aarti Krishnan, former postdoc Melis Anahtar ’08, and Jacqueline Valeri PhD ’23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploring chemical space&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past 45 years, a few dozen&amp;nbsp;new antibiotics have been approved by the FDA, but most of these are variants of existing antibiotics. At the same time, bacterial resistance to many of these drugs has been growing. Globally, it is estimated that drug-resistant bacterial infections cause nearly 5 million deaths per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In hopes of finding new antibiotics to fight this growing problem, Collins and others at MIT’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.audaciousproject.org/grantees/collins-lab\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Antibiotics-AI Project&lt;/a&gt; have harnessed the power of AI to screen huge libraries of existing chemical compounds. This work has yielded several promising drug candidates, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/artificial-intelligence-identifies-new-antibiotic-0220\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;halicin&lt;/a&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/using-ai-scientists-combat-drug-resistant-infections-0525\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;abaucin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build on that progress, Collins and his colleagues decided to expand their search into molecules that can’t be found in any chemical libraries. By using AI to generate hypothetically possible molecules that don’t exist or haven’t been discovered, they realized that it should be possible to explore a much greater diversity of potential drug compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, the researchers employed two different approaches: First, they directed generative AI algorithms to design molecules based on a specific chemical fragment that showed antimicrobial activity, and second, they let the algorithms freely generate molecules, without having to include a specific fragment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the fragment-based approach, the researchers sought to identify molecules that could kill &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;a Gram-negative bacterium that causes gonorrhea. They began by assembling a library of about 45 million known chemical fragments, consisting of all possible combinations of 11 atoms of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, and sulfur, along with fragments from Enamine’s REadily AccessibLe (REAL) space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they screened the library using machine-learning models that Collins’ lab has previously trained to predict antibacterial activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This resulted in nearly 4 million fragments. They narrowed down that pool by removing any fragments predicted to be cytotoxic to human cells, displayed chemical liabilities, and were known to be similar to existing antibiotics. This left them with about 1 million candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to get rid of anything that would look like an existing antibiotic, to help address the antimicrobial resistance crisis in a fundamentally different way. By venturing into underexplored areas of chemical space, our goal was to uncover novel mechanisms of action,” Krishnan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through several rounds of additional experiments and computational analysis, the researchers identified a fragment they called F1 that appeared to have promising activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. They used this fragment as the basis for generating additional compounds, using two different generative AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those algorithms, known as chemically reasonable mutations (CReM), works by starting with a particular molecule containing F1 and then generating new molecules by adding, replacing, or deleting atoms and chemical groups. The second algorithm, F-VAE (fragment-based variational autoencoder), takes a chemical fragment and builds it into a complete molecule. It does so by learning patterns of how fragments are commonly modified, based on its pretraining on more than 1 million molecules from the ChEMBL database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those two algorithms generated about 7 million candidates containing F1, which the researchers then computationally screened for activity against &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt;. This screen yielded about 1,000 compounds, and the researchers selected 80 of those to see if they could be produced by chemical synthesis vendors. Only two of these could be synthesized, and one of them, named NG1, was very effective at killing &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; in a lab dish and in a mouse model of drug-resistant gonorrhea infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional experiments revealed that NG1 interacts with a protein called LptA, a novel drug target involved in the synthesis of the bacterial outer membrane. It appears that the drug works by interfering with membrane synthesis, which is fatal to cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unconstrained design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a second round of studies, the researchers explored the potential of using generative AI to freely design molecules, using Gram-positive bacteria, &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; as their target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, the researchers used CReM and VAE to generate molecules, but this time with no constraints other than the general rules of how atoms can join to form chemically plausible molecules. Together, the models generated more than 29 million compounds. The researchers then applied the same filters that they did to the &lt;em&gt;N. gonorrhoeae&lt;/em&gt; candidates, but focusing on &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt;, eventually narrowing the pool down to about 90 compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were able to synthesize and test 22 of these molecules, and six of them showed strong antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;grown in a lab dish. They also found that the top candidate, named DN1, was able to clear a methicillin-resistant &lt;em&gt;S. aureus&lt;/em&gt; (MRSA) skin infection in a mouse model. These molecules also appear to interfere with bacterial cell membranes, but with broader effects not limited to interaction with one specific protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phare Bio, a nonprofit that is also part of the Antibiotics-AI Project, is now working on further modifying NG1 and DN1 to make them suitable for additional testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a collaboration with Phare Bio, we are exploring analogs, as well as working on advancing the best candidates preclinically, through medicinal chemistry work,” Collins says. “We are also excited about applying the platforms that Aarti and the team have developed toward other bacterial pathogens of interest, notably &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded, in part, by the U.S. Defense&amp;nbsp;Threat Reduction Agency, the&amp;nbsp;National Institutes of Health,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Audacious Project, Flu Lab, the Sea Grape Foundation, Rosamund Zander and Hansjorg Wyss for the Wyss Foundation, and an anonymous donor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Novel-Antibiotics-01.jpg?itok=hrC95Mtj\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">With help from artificial intelligence, MIT researchers have discovered novel antibiotics that can combat two hard-to-treat infections: a drug-resistant form of gonorrhea and multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock, MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-resistance\">Drug resistance</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/microbes\">Microbes</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/disease\">Disease</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/bacteria\">Bacteria</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/antibiotics\">Antibiotics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/drug-development\">Drug development</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/institute-medical-engineering-and-science-imes-0\">Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>A new way to test how well AI systems classify text</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-way-test-how-well-ai-systems-classify-text-0813</link>\n  <description>As large language models increasingly dominate our everyday lives, new systems for checking their reliability are more important than ever.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-way-test-how-well-ai-systems-classify-text-0813</guid>\n        <dc:creator>David Chandler | MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Is this movie review a rave or a pan? Is this news story about business or technology? Is this online chatbot conversation veering off into giving financial advice? Is this online medical information site giving out misinformation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of automated conversations, whether they involve seeking a movie or restaurant review or getting information about your bank account or health records, are becoming increasingly prevalent. More than ever, such evaluations are being made by highly sophisticated algorithms, known as text classifiers, rather than by human beings. But how can we tell how accurate these classifications really are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS) has come up with an innovative approach to not only measure how well these classifiers are doing their job, but then go one step further and show how to make them more accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new evaluation and remediation software was led and developed by Lei Xu alongside the research conducted by Sarah Alnegheimish, Kalyan Veeramachaneni, a principal research scientist at LIDS and senior author, with two others. The software package is being made freely available for download by anyone who wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A standard method for testing these classification systems is to create what are known as&amp;nbsp;synthetic examples — sentences that closely resemble ones that have already been classified. For example, researchers might take a sentence that has already been tagged by a classifier program as being a rave review, and see if changing a word or a few words while retaining the same meaning could fool the classifier into deeming it a pan. Or a sentence that was determined to be misinformation might get misclassified as accurate. This ability to fool the classifiers makes these adversarial examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People have tried various ways to find the vulnerabilities in these classifiers, Veeramachaneni says. But existing methods of finding these vulnerabilities have a hard time with this task and miss many examples that they should catch, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increasingly, companies are trying to use such evaluation tools in real time, monitoring the output of chatbots used for various purposes to try to make sure they are not putting out improper responses. For example, a bank might use a chatbot to respond to routine customer queries such as checking account balances or applying for a credit card, but it wants to ensure that its responses could never be interpreted as financial advice, which could expose the company to liability. “Before showing the chatbot’s response to the end user, they want to use the text classifier to detect whether it’s giving financial advice or not,” Veeramachaneni says. But then it’s important to test that classifier to see how reliable its evaluations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These chatbots, or summarization engines or whatnot are being set up across the board,” he says, to deal with external customers and within an organization as well, for example providing information about HR issues. It’s important to put these text classifiers into the loop to detect things that they are not supposed to say, and filter those out before the output gets transmitted to the user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s where the use of adversarial examples comes in — those sentences that have already been classified but then produce a different response when they are slightly modified while retaining the same meaning. How can people confirm that the meaning is the same? By using another large language model (LLM) that interprets and compares meanings. So, if the LLM says the two sentences mean the same thing, but the classifier labels them differently, “that is a sentence that is adversarial — it can fool the classifier,” Veeramachaneni says. And when the researchers examined these adversarial sentences, “we found that most of the time, this was just a one-word change,” although the people using LLMs to generate these alternate sentences often didn’t realize that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further investigation, using LLMs to analyze many thousands of examples, showed that certain specific words had an outsized influence in changing the classifications, and therefore the testing of a classifier’s accuracy could focus on this small subset of words that seem to make the most difference. They found that one-tenth of 1 percent of all the 30,000 words in the system’s vocabulary could account for almost half of all these reversals of classification, in some specific applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lei Xu PhD ’23, a recent graduate from LIDS who performed much of the analysis as part of his thesis work, “used a lot of interesting estimation techniques to figure out what are the most powerful words that can change the overall classification, that can fool the classifier,” Veeramachaneni says. The goal is to make it possible to do much more narrowly targeted searches, rather than combing through all possible word substitutions, thus making the computational task of generating adversarial examples much more manageable. “He’s using large language models, interestingly enough, as a way to understand the power of a single word.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, also using LLMs, he&amp;nbsp;searches for other words that are closely related to these powerful words, and so on, allowing for an overall ranking of words according to their influence on the outcomes. Once these adversarial sentences have been found, they can be used in turn to retrain the classifier to take them into account, increasing the robustness of the classifier against those mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making classifiers more accurate may not sound like a big deal if it’s just a matter of classifying news articles into categories, or deciding whether reviews of anything from movies to restaurants are positive or negative. But increasingly, classifiers are being used in settings where the outcomes really do matter, whether preventing the inadvertent release of sensitive medical, financial, or security information, or helping to guide important research, such as into properties of chemical compounds or the folding of proteins for biomedical applications, or in identifying and blocking hate speech or known misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this research, the team introduced a new metric, which they call p, which provides a measure of how robust a given classifier is against single-word attacks. And because of the importance of such misclassifications, the research team has made its products available as open access for anyone to use. The package consists of two components: SP-Attack, which generates adversarial sentences to test classifiers in any particular application, and SP-Defense, which aims to improve the robustness of the classifier by generating and using adversarial sentences to retrain the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some tests, where competing methods of testing classifier outputs allowed a 66 percent success rate by adversarial attacks, this team’s system cut that attack success rate almost in half, to 33.7 percent. In other applications, the improvement was as little as a 2 percent difference, but even that can be quite important, Veeramachaneni says, since these systems are being used for so many billions of interactions that even a small percentage can affect millions of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s results were published on July 7 in the journal &lt;em&gt;Expert Systems&lt;/em&gt; in a paper by Xu, Veeramachaneni, and Alnegheimish of LIDS, along with Laure Berti-Equille at IRD in Marseille, France, and Alfredo Cuesta-Infante at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, in Spain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/mit-lids-text-classifier.jpg?itok=EFDHW0eB\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new approach measures how well text classifiers are doing their job, and shows how to make them more accurate.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-access\">Open access</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT gears up to transform manufacturing</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-gears-transform-manufacturing-0813</link>\n  <description>The Initiative for New Manufacturing is convening experts across the Institute to drive a transformation of production across the U.S. and the world.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 13 Aug 2025 15:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-gears-transform-manufacturing-0813</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Eric Bender | MIT Industrial Liaison Program</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;“Manufacturing is the engine of society, and it is the backbone of robust, resilient economies,” says John Hart, head of MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering (MechE) and faculty co-director of the MIT &lt;a href=\"http://inm.mit.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Initiative for New Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; (INM). “With manufacturing a lively topic in today’s news, there’s a renewed appreciation and understanding of the importance of manufacturing to innovation, to economic and national security, and to daily lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched this May, INM will “help create a transformation of manufacturing through new technology, through development of talent, and through an understanding of how to scale manufacturing in a way that enables imparts higher productivity and resilience, drives adoption of new technologies, and creates good jobs,” Hart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM is one of MIT’s strategic initiatives and builds on the successful three-year-old Manufacturing@MIT program. “It’s a recognition by MIT that manufacturing is an Institute-wide theme and an Institute-wide priority, and that manufacturing connects faculty and students across campus,” says Hart. Alongside Hart, INM’s faculty co-directors are Institute Professor Suzanne Berger and Chris Love, professor of chemical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative is pursuing four main themes: reimagining manufacturing technologies and systems, elevating the productivity and human experience of manufacturing, scaling up new manufacturing, and transforming the manufacturing base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking manufacturing barriers for corporations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amgen, Autodesk, Flex, GE Vernova, PTC, Sanofi, and Siemens are founding members of INM’s industry consortium. These industry partners will work closely with MIT faculty, researchers,&amp;nbsp;and students across many aspects of manufacturing-related research, both in broad-scale initiatives and in particular areas of shared interests. Membership requires a minimum three-year commitment of $500,000 a year to manufacturing-related activities at MIT, including the INM membership fee of $275,000 per year, which supports several core activities that engage the industry members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major thrust for INM industry collaboration is the deployment and adoption of AI and automation in manufacturing. This effort will include seed research projects at MIT, collaborative case studies, and shared strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM also offers companies participation in the MIT-wide New Manufacturing Research effort, which is studying the trajectories of specific manufacturing industries and examining cross-cutting themes such as technology and financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, INM will concentrate on education for all professions in manufacturing, with alliances bringing together corporations, community colleges, government agencies, and other partners. “We'll scale our curriculum to broader audiences, from aspiring manufacturing workers and aspiring production line supervisors all the way up to engineers and executives,” says Hart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In workforce training, INM will collaborate with companies broadly to help understand the challenges and frame its overall workforce agenda, and with individual firms on specific challenges, such as acquiring suitably prepared employees for a new factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, industry partners will also engage directly with students. Founding member Flex, for instance, hosted MIT researchers and students at the Flex Institute of Technology in Sorocaba, Brazil, developing new solutions for electronics manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“History shows that you need to innovate in manufacturing alongside the innovation in products,” Hart comments. “At MIT, as more students take classes in manufacturing, they’ll think more about key manufacturing issues as they decide what research problems they want to solve, or what choices they make as they prototype their devices. The same is true for industry — companies that operate at the frontier of manufacturing, whether through internal capabilities or their supply chains, are positioned to be on the frontier of product innovation and overall growth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll have an opportunity to bring manufacturing upstream to the early stage of research, designing new processes and new devices with scalability in mind,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MIT expects to open new manufacturing-related labs and to further broaden cooperation with industry at existing shared facilities, such as MIT.nano. Hart says that facilities will also invite tighter collaborations with corporations — not just providing advanced equipment, but working jointly on, say, new technologies for weaving textiles, or speeding up battery manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homing in on the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INM is a global project that brings a particular focus on the United States, which remains the world’s second-largest manufacturing economy, but has suffered a significant decline in manufacturing employment and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One key to reversing this trend and reinvigorating the U.S. manufacturing base is advocacy for manufacturing’s critical role in society and the career opportunities it offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one really disputes the importance of manufacturing,” Hart says. “But we need to elevate interest in manufacturing as a rewarding career, from the production workers to manufacturing engineers and leaders, through advocacy, education programs, and buy-in from industry, government, and academia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT is in a unique position to convene industry, academic, and government stakeholders in manufacturing to work together on this vital issue, he points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in times of radical and rapid changes in manufacturing, “we need to focus on deploying new technologies into factories and supply chains,” Hart says. “Technology is not all of the solution, but for the U.S. to expand our manufacturing base, we need to do it with technology as a key enabler, embracing companies of all sizes, including small and medium enterprises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As AI becomes more capable, and automation becomes more flexible and more available, these are key building blocks upon which you can address manufacturing challenges,” he says. “AI and automation offer new accelerated ways to develop, deploy, and monitor production processes, which present a huge opportunity and, in some cases, a necessity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While manufacturing is always a combination of old technology, new technology, established practice, and new ways of thinking, digital technology gives manufacturers an opportunity to leapfrog competitors,” Hart says. “That’s very, very powerful for the U.S. and any company, or country, that aims to create differentiated capabilities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, in recent years, investors have increasingly bought into new manufacturing in the United States. “They see the opportunity to re-industrialize, to build the factories and production systems of the future,” Hart says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That said, building new manufacturing is capital-intensive, and takes time,” he adds. “So that’s another area where it’s important to convene stakeholders and to think about how startups and growth-stage companies build their capital portfolios, how large industry can support an ecosystem of small businesses and young companies, and how to develop talent to support those growing companies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these concerns and opportunities in the manufacturing ecosystem play to MIT’s strengths. “MIT’s DNA of cross-disciplinary collaboration and working with industry can let us create a lot of impact,” Hart emphasizes. “We can understand the practical challenges. We can also explore breakthrough ideas in research and cultivate successful outcomes, all the way to new companies and partnerships. Sometimes those are seen as disparate approaches, but we like to bring them together.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/john-hart-mit-00.png?itok=W2PumkXm\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">John Hart is head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and faculty co-director of the Initiative for New Manufacturing.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: David Sella</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/chemical-engineering\">Chemical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mechanical-engineering\">Mechanical engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitnano\">MIT.nano</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/education\">Education, teaching, academics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/industry\">Industry</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/manufacturing\">Manufacturing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/collaboration\">Collaboration</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/labor-jobs\">Labor and jobs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-and-policy\">Technology and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/political-science\">Political science</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Eco-driving measures could significantly reduce vehicle emissions</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/eco-driving-measures-could-significantly-reduce-vehicle-emissions-0807</link>\n  <description>New research shows automatically controlling vehicle speeds to mitigate traffic at intersections can cut carbon emissions between 11 and 22 percent.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/eco-driving-measures-could-significantly-reduce-vehicle-emissions-0807</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Any motorist who has ever waited through multiple cycles for a traffic light to turn green knows how annoying signalized intersections can be. But sitting at intersections isn’t just a drag on drivers’ patience — unproductive vehicle idling could contribute as much as 15 percent of the carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. land transportation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale modeling study led by MIT researchers reveals that eco-driving measures, which can involve dynamically adjusting vehicle speeds to reduce stopping and excessive acceleration, could significantly reduce those CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a powerful artificial intelligence method called deep reinforcement learning, the researchers conducted an in-depth impact assessment of the factors affecting vehicle emissions in three major U.S. cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their analysis indicates that fully adopting eco-driving measures could cut annual city-wide intersection carbon emissions by 11 to 22 percent, without slowing traffic throughput or affecting vehicle and traffic safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles on the road employ eco-driving, it would result in 25 to 50 percent of the total reduction in CO2 emissions, the researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, dynamically optimizing speed limits at about 20 percent of intersections provides 70 percent of the total emission benefits. This indicates that eco-driving measures could be implemented gradually while still having measurable, positive impacts on mitigating climate change and improving public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/sites/default/files/images/inline/eco-driving.gif\" data-align=\"center\" data-entity-uuid=\"49a19790-c04e-4465-ad70-9841001a6200\" data-entity-type=\"file\" alt=\"Two intersections with lots of cars; the 100% adoption has less traffic.\" width=\"521\" height=\"333\" data-caption=\"An animated GIF compares what 20% eco-driving adoption looks like to 100% eco-driving adoption.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Image: Courtesy of the researchers\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vehicle-based control strategies like eco-driving can move the needle on climate change reduction. We’ve shown here that modern machine-learning tools, like deep reinforcement learning, can accelerate the kinds of analysis that support sociotechnical decision making. This is just the tip of the iceberg,” says senior author Cathy Wu, the Class of 1954 Career Development Associate Professor in Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) and the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) at MIT, and a member of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by lead author Vindula Jayawardana, an MIT graduate student; as well as MIT graduate students Ao Qu, Cameron Hickert, and Edgar Sanchez; MIT undergraduate Catherine Tang; Baptiste Freydt, a graduate student at ETH Zurich; and Mark Taylor and Blaine Leonard of the Utah Department of Transportation. The &lt;a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X25001500\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;research appears&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A multi-part modeling study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic control measures typically call to mind fixed infrastructure, like stop signs and traffic signals. But as vehicles become more technologically advanced, it presents an opportunity for eco-driving, which is a catch-all term for vehicle-based traffic control measures like the use of dynamic speeds to reduce energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the near term, eco-driving could involve speed guidance in the form of vehicle dashboards or smartphone apps. In the longer term, eco-driving could involve intelligent speed commands that directly control the acceleration of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles through vehicle-to-infrastructure communication systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most prior work has focused on how&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;to implement eco-driving. We shifted the frame to consider the question of should&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;we implement eco-driving. If we were to deploy this technology at scale, would it make a difference?” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, the researchers embarked on a multifaceted modeling study that would take the better part of four years to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They began by identifying 33 factors that influence vehicle emissions, including temperature, road grade, intersection topology, age of the vehicle, traffic demand, vehicle types, driver behavior, traffic signal timing, road geometry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the biggest challenges was making sure we were diligent and didn’t leave out any major factors,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then they used data from OpenStreetMap, U.S. geological surveys, and other sources to create digital replicas of more than 6,000 signalized intersections in three cities — Atlanta, San Francisco, and Los Angeles — and simulated more than a million traffic scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used deep reinforcement learning to optimize each scenario for eco-driving to achieve the maximum emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reinforcement learning optimizes the vehicles’ driving behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a high-fidelity traffic simulator, rewarding vehicle behaviors that are more energy-efficient while penalizing those that are not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers cast the problem as a decentralized cooperative multi-agent control problem, where the vehicles cooperate to achieve overall energy efficiency, even among non-participating vehicles, and they act in a decentralized manner, avoiding the need for costly communication between vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, training vehicle behaviors that generalize across diverse intersection traffic scenarios was a major challenge. The researchers observed that some scenarios are more similar to one another than others, such as scenarios with the same number of lanes or the same number of traffic signal phases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, the researchers trained separate reinforcement learning models for different clusters of traffic scenarios, yielding better emission benefits overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with the help of AI, analyzing citywide traffic at the network level would be so computationally intensive it could take another decade to unravel, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, they broke the problem down and solved each eco-driving scenario at the individual intersection level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We carefully constrained the impact of eco-driving control at each intersection on neighboring intersections. In this way, we dramatically simplified the problem, which enabled us to perform this analysis at scale, without introducing unknown network effects,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant emissions benefits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they analyzed the results, the researchers found that full adoption of eco-driving could result in intersection emissions reductions of between 11 and 22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits differ depending on the layout of a city’s streets. A denser city like San Francisco has less room to implement eco-driving between intersections, offering a possible explanation for reduced emission savings, while Atlanta could see greater benefits given its higher speed limits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if only 10 percent of vehicles employ eco-driving, a city could still realize 25 to 50 percent of the total emissions benefit because of car-following dynamics: Non-eco-driving vehicles would follow controlled eco-driving vehicles as they optimize speed to pass smoothly through intersections, reducing their carbon emissions as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, eco-driving could also increase vehicle throughput by minimizing emissions. However, Wu cautions that increasing throughput could result in more drivers taking to the roads, reducing emissions benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while their analysis of widely used safety metrics known as surrogate safety measures, such as time to collision, suggest that eco-driving is as safe as human driving, it could cause unexpected behavior in human drivers. More research is needed to fully understand potential safety impacts, Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their results also show that eco-driving could provide even greater benefits when combined with alternative transportation decarbonization solutions. For instance, 20 percent eco-driving adoption in San Francisco would cut emission levels by 7 percent, but when combined with the projected adoption of hybrid and electric vehicles, it would cut emissions by 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a first attempt to systematically quantify network-wide environmental benefits of eco-driving. This is a great research effort that will serve as a key reference for others to build on in the assessment of eco-driving systems,” says Hesham Rakha, the Samuel L. Pritchard Professor of Engineering at Virginia Tech, who was not involved with this research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while the researchers focus on carbon emissions, the benefits are highly correlated with improvements in fuel consumption, energy use, and air quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is almost a free intervention. We already have smartphones in our cars, and we are rapidly adopting cars with more advanced automation features. For something to scale quickly in practice, it must be relatively simple to implement and shovel-ready. Eco-driving fits that bill,” Wu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is funded, in part, by Amazon and the Utah Department of Transportation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-EcoDriving-01-press.jpg?itok=qAjylkrY\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">Implementing co-driving techniques can significantly reduce intersection carbon dioxide emissions without impacting traffic throughput or safety, according to new MIT research.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: iStock; MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/transportation\">Transportation</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cities\">Cities</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/autonomous-vehicles\">Autonomous vehicles</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/emissions\">Emissions</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/sustainability\">Sustainability</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/climate-change\">Climate change</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/civil-engineering\">Civil and environmental engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>School of Architecture and Planning welcomes new faculty for 2025</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/school-architecture-planning-welcomes-new-faculty-0806</link>\n  <description>Four new professors join the Department of Architecture and MIT Media Lab.</description>\n  <pubDate>Wed, 06 Aug 2025 16:10:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/school-architecture-planning-welcomes-new-faculty-0806</guid>\n        <dc:creator>School of Architecture and Planning</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Four new faculty members join the School of Architecture and Planning (SA+P) this fall, offering the MIT community creativity, knowledge, and scholarship in multidisciplinary roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These individuals add considerable strength and depth to our faculty,” says Hashim Sarkis, dean of the School of Architecture and Planning. “We are excited for the academic vigor they bring to research and teaching.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/karrie-karahalios-announce/\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karrie G.

That’s because traditional data storage systems were designed to handle simple commands from a handful of users at once, whereas today, AI systems with millions of agents need to continuously access and process large amounts of data in parallel. Traditional data storage systems now have layers of complexity, which slows AI systems down because data must pass through multiple tiers before reaching the graphical processing units (GPUs) that are the brain cells of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian, co-founded by Michael Tso ’93, SM ’93 and Hiroshi Ohta, is helping storage keep up with the AI revolution. The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models. The system reduces complexity by applying parallel computing to data storage, consolidating AI functions and data onto a single parallel-processing platform that stores, retrieves, and processes scalable datasets, with direct, high-speed transfers between storage and GPUs and CPUs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s integrated storage-computing platform simplifies the process of building commercial-scale AI tools and gives businesses a storage foundation that can keep up with the rise of AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the things people miss about AI is that it’s all about the data,” Tso says. “You can’t get a 10 percent improvement in AI performance with 10 percent more data or even 10 times more data — you need 1,000 times more data. Being able to store that data in a way that’s easy to manage, and in such a way that you can embed computations into it so you can run operations while the data is coming in without moving the data — that’s where this industry is going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From MIT to industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an undergraduate at MIT in the 1990s, Tso was introduced by Professor William Dally to parallel computing — a type of computation in which many calculations occur simultaneously. Tso also worked on parallel computing with Associate Professor Greg Papadopoulos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was an incredible time because most schools had one super-computing project going on — MIT had four,” Tso recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student, Tso worked with MIT senior research scientist David Clark, a computing pioneer who contributed to the internet’s early architecture, particularly the transmission control protocol (TCP) that delivers data between systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a graduate student at MIT, I worked on disconnected and intermittent networking operations for large scale distributed systems,” Tso says. “It’s funny — 30 years on, that’s what I’m still doing today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his graduation, Tso worked at Intel’s Architecture Lab, where he invented data synchronization algorithms used by Blackberry. He also created specifications for Nokia that ignited the ringtone download industry. He then joined Inktomi, a startup co-founded by Eric Brewer SM ’92, PhD ’94 that pioneered search and web content distribution technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Tso started Gemini Mobile Technologies with Joseph Norton ’93, SM ’93 and others. The company went on to build the world’s largest mobile messaging systems to handle the massive data growth from camera phones. Then, in the late 2000s, cloud computing became a powerful way for businesses to rent virtual servers as they grew their operations. Tso noticed the amount of data being collected was growing far faster than the speed of networking, so he decided to pivot the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Data is being created in a lot of different places, and that data has its own gravity: It’s going to cost you money and time to move it,” Tso explains. “That means the end state is a distributed cloud that reaches out to edge devices and servers. You have to bring the cloud to the data, not the data to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tso officially launched Cloudian out of Gemini Mobile Technologies in 2012, with a new emphasis on helping customers with scalable, distributed, cloud-compatible data storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we didn’t see when we first started the company was that AI was going to be the ultimate use case for data on the edge,” Tso says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Tso’s research at MIT began more than two decades ago, he sees strong connections between what he worked on and the industry today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s like my whole life is playing back because David Clark and I were dealing with disconnected and intermittently connected networks, which are part of every edge use case today, and Professor Dally was working on very fast, scalable interconnects,” Tso says, noting that Dally is now the senior vice president and chief scientist at the leading AI company NVIDIA. “Now, when you look at the modern NVIDIA chip architecture and the way they do interchip communication, it’s got Dally’s work all over it. With Professor Papadopoulos, I worked on accelerate application software with parallel computing hardware without having to rewrite the applications, and that’s exactly the problem we are trying to solve with NVIDIA. Coincidentally, all the stuff I was doing at MIT is playing out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Cloudian’s platform uses an object storage architecture in which all kinds of data —documents, videos, sensor data — are stored as a unique object with metadata. Object storage can manage massive datasets in a flat file stucture, making it ideal for unstructured data and AI systems, but it traditionally hasn’t been able to send data directly to AI models without the data first being copied into a computer’s memory system, creating latency and energy bottlenecks for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Cloudian announced that it has extended its object storage system with a vector database that stores data in a form which is immediately usable by AI models. As the data are ingested, Cloudian is computing in real-time the vector form of that data to power AI tools like recommender engines, search, and AI assistants. Cloudian also announced a partnership with NVIDIA that allows its storage system to work directly with the AI company’s GPUs. Cloudian says the new system enables even faster AI operations and reduces computing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“NVIDIA contacted us about a year and a half ago because GPUs are useful only with data that keeps them busy,” Tso says. “Now that people are realizing it’s easier to move the AI to the data than it is to move huge datasets. Our storage systems embed a lot of AI functions, so we’re able to pre- and post-process data for AI near where we collect and store the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-first storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian is helping about 1,000 companies around the world get more value out of their data, including large manufacturers, financial service providers, health care organizations, and government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudian’s storage platform is helping one large automaker, for instance, use AI to determine when each of its manufacturing robots need to be serviced. Cloudian is also working with the National Library of Medicine to store research articles and patents, and the National Cancer Database to store DNA sequences of tumors — rich datasets that AI models could process to help research develop new treatments or gain new insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“GPUs have been an incredible enabler,” Tso says. “Moore’s Law doubles the amount of compute every two years, but GPUs are able to parallelize operations on chips, so you can network GPUs together and shatter Moore’s Law. That scale is pushing AI to new levels of intelligence, but the only way to make GPUs work hard is to feed them data at the same speed that they compute — and the only way to do that is to get rid of all the layers between them and your data.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202508/MIT-Cloudian-01.jpg?itok=j9Gg2rpo\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">The company has developed a scalable storage system for businesses that helps data flow seamlessly between storage and AI models.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/alumni\">Alumni/ae</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/startups\">Startups</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/innovation\">Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&amp;E)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>MIT tool visualizes and edits “physically impossible” objects</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-meschers-tool-visualizes-edits-physically-impossible-objects-0804</link>\n  <description>By visualizing Escher-like optical illusions in 2.5 dimensions, the “Meschers” tool could help scientists understand physics-defying shapes and spark new designs.</description>\n  <pubDate>Mon, 04 Aug 2025 16:40:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/mit-meschers-tool-visualizes-edits-physically-impossible-objects-0804</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Alex Shipps | MIT CSAIL</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\" id=\"docs-internal-guid-00f766d6-7fff-403a-378d-5aaf2f5b25af\"&gt;M.C. Escher’s artwork is a gateway into a world of depth-defying optical illusions, featuring “impossible objects” that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries. What you perceive his illustrations to be depends on your point of view — for example, a person seemingly walking upstairs may be heading down the steps if you tilt your head&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.54256.html\"&gt;sideways&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Computer graphics scientists and designers can recreate these illusions in 3D, but only by bending or cutting a real shape and positioning it at a particular angle. This workaround has downsides, though: Changing the smoothness or lighting of the structure will expose that it isn’t actually an optical illusion, which also means you can’t accurately solve geometry problems on it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have developed a unique approach to represent “impossible” objects in a more versatile way. Their “&lt;a href=\"https://anadodik.github.io/publication/meschers/\"&gt;Meschers&lt;/a&gt;” tool converts images and 3D models into 2.5-dimensional structures, creating Escher-like depictions of things like windows, buildings, and even donuts. The approach helps users relight, smooth out, and study unique geometries while preserving their optical illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This tool could assist geometry researchers with calculating the distance between two points on a curved impossible surface (“geodesics”) and simulating how heat dissipates over it (“heat diffusion”). It could also help artists and computer graphics scientists create physics-breaking designs in multiple dimensions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lead author and MIT PhD student Ana Dodik aims to design computer graphics tools that aren’t limited to replicating reality, enabling artists to express their intent independently of whether a shape can be realized in the physical world. “Using Meschers, we’ve unlocked a new class of shapes for artists to work with on the computer,” she says. “They could also help perception scientists understand the point at which an object truly becomes impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Dodik and her colleagues will present their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://anadodik.github.io/publication/meschers/Meschers.pdf\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; at the SIGGRAPH conference in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making impossible objects possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Impossible objects can’t be fully replicated in 3D. Their constituent parts often look plausible, but these parts don’t glue together properly when assembled in 3D. But what can be computationally imitated, as the CSAIL researchers found out, is the process of how we perceive these shapes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://www.illusionsindex.org/i/impossible-triangle\"&gt;Penrose Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. The object as a whole is physically impossible because the depths don’t “add up,” but we can recognize real-world 3D shapes (like its three L-shaped corners) within it. These smaller regions can be realized in 3D — a property called “local consistency” — but when we try to assemble them together, they don’t form a globally consistent shape.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Meschers approach models’ locally consistent regions without forcing them to be globally consistent, piecing together an Escher-esque structure. Behind the scenes, Meschers represents impossible objects as if we know their x and y coordinates in the image, as well as differences in z coordinates (depth) between neighboring pixels; the tool uses these differences in depth to reason about impossible objects indirectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The many uses of Meschers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to rendering impossible objects, Meschers can subdivide their structures into smaller shapes for more precise geometry calculations and smoothing operations. This process enabled the researchers to reduce visual imperfections of impossible shapes, such as a red heart outline they thinned out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The researchers also tested their tool on an “impossibagel,” where a bagel is shaded in a physically impossible way. Meschers helped Dodik and her colleagues simulate heat diffusion and calculate geodesic distances between different points of the model.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Imagine you’re an ant traversing this bagel, and you want to know how long it’ll take you to get across, for example,” says Dodik. “In the same way, our tool could help mathematicians analyze the underlying geometry of impossible shapes up close, much like how we study real-world ones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Much like a magician, the tool can create optical illusions out of otherwise practical objects, making it easier for computer graphics artists to create impossible objects. It can also use “inverse rendering” tools to convert drawings and images of impossible objects into high-dimensional designs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Meschers demonstrates how computer graphics tools don’t have to be constrained by the rules of physical reality,” says senior author Justin Solomon, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science and leader of the CSAIL Geometric Data Processing Group. “Incredibly, artists using Meschers can reason about shapes that we will never find in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Meschers can also aid computer graphics artists with tweaking the shading of their creations, while still preserving an optical illusion. This versatility would allow creatives to change the lighting of their art to depict a wider variety of scenes (like a sunrise or sunset) — as Meschers demonstrated by relighting a model of a dog on a skateboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Despite its versatility, Meschers is just the start for Dodik and her colleagues. The team is considering designing an interface to make the tool easier to use while building more elaborate scenes. They’re also working with perception scientists to see how the computer graphics tool can be used more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dodik and Solomon wrote the paper with CSAIL affiliates Isabella Yu ’24, SM ’25; PhD student Kartik Chandra SM ’23; MIT professors Jonathan Ragan-Kelley and Joshua Tenenbaum; and MIT Assistant Professor Vincent Sitzmann.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their work was supported, in part, by the MIT Presidential Fellowship, the Mathworks Fellowship, the Hertz Foundation, the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Schmidt Sciences AI2050 fellowship, MIT Quest for Intelligence, the U.S. Army Research Office, U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research, SystemsThatLearn@CSAIL initiative, Google, the MIT–IBM Watson AI Laboratory, from the Toyota–CSAIL Joint Research Center, Adobe Systems, the Singapore Defence Science and Technology Agency, and the U.S. Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/mit-csail-Meschers.jpg?itok=mwr0SOLG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">“Meschers” can create multi-dimensional versions of objects that break the laws of physics with convoluted geometries, such as buildings you might see in an M.C.

In computer science parlance, the molecule is “symmetric,” meaning the fundamental structure of that molecule remains the same if it undergoes certain transformations, like rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a drug discovery model doesn’t understand symmetry, it could make inaccurate predictions about molecular properties. But despite some empirical successes, it’s been unclear whether there is a computationally efficient method to train a good model that is guaranteed to respect symmetry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A new study by MIT researchers answers this question, and shows the first method for machine learning with symmetry that is provably efficient in terms of both the amount of computation and data needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results clarify a foundational question, and they could aid researchers in the development of more powerful machine-learning models that are designed to handle symmetry. Such models would be useful in a variety of applications, from discovering new materials to identifying astronomical anomalies to unraveling complex climate patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These symmetries are important because they are some sort of information that nature is telling us about the data, and we should take it into account in our machine-learning models. We’ve now shown that it is possible to do machine-learning with symmetric data in an efficient way,” says Behrooz Tahmasebi, an MIT graduate student and co-lead author of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is joined on the &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.19758\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; by co-lead author and MIT graduate student Ashkan Soleymani; Stefanie Jegelka, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) and a member of the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS) and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); and senior author Patrick Jaillet, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a principal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Studying symmetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symmetric data appear in many domains, especially the natural sciences and physics. A model that recognizes symmetries is able to identify an object, like a car, no matter where that object is placed in an image, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless a machine-learning model is designed to handle symmetry, it could be less accurate and prone to failure when faced with new symmetric data in real-world situations. On the flip side, models that take advantage of symmetry could be faster and require fewer data for training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But training a model to process symmetric data is no easy task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common approach is called data augmentation, where researchers transform each symmetric data point into multiple data points to help the model generalize better to new data. For instance, one could rotate a molecular structure many times to produce new training data, but if researchers want the model to be guaranteed to respect symmetry, this can be computationally prohibitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An alternative approach is to encode symmetry into the model’s architecture. A well-known example of this is a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently handles symmetric data because of how it is designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Graph neural networks are fast and efficient, and they take care of symmetry quite well, but nobody really knows what these models are learning or why they work. Understanding GNNs is a main motivation of our work, so we started with a theoretical evaluation of what happens when data are symmetric,” Tahmasebi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They explored the statistical-computational tradeoff in machine learning with symmetric data. This tradeoff means methods that require fewer data can be more computationally expensive, so researchers need to find the right balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on this theoretical evaluation, the researchers designed an efficient algorithm for machine learning with symmetric data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mathematical combinations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they borrowed ideas from algebra to shrink and simplify the problem. Then, they reformulated the problem using ideas from geometry that effectively capture symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, they combined the algebra and the geometry into an optimization problem that can be solved efficiently, resulting in their new algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most of the theory and applications were focusing on either algebra or geometry. Here we just combined them,” Tahmasebi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm requires fewer data samples for training than classical approaches, which would improve a model’s accuracy and ability to adapt to new applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By proving that scientists can develop efficient algorithms for machine learning with symmetry, and demonstrating how it can be done, these results could lead to the development of new neural network architectures that could be more accurate and less resource-intensive than current models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists could also use this analysis as a starting point to examine the inner workings of GNNs, and how their operations differ from the algorithm the MIT researchers developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once we know that better, we can design more interpretable, more robust, and more efficient neural network architectures,” adds Soleymani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the National Research Foundation of Singapore, DSO National Laboratories of Singapore, the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the U.S. National Science Foundation, and an Alexander von Humboldt Professorship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Learning-Symmetric-01.jpg?itok=jTPWN5G8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study by MIT researchers shows the first method for machine learning with symmetry that is provably efficient in terms of both the amount of computation and data needed.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock, MIT News</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/data\">Data</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-science-and-artificial-intelligence-laboratory-csail\">Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nsf\">National Science Foundation (NSF)</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>“FUTURE PHASES” showcases new frontiers in music technology and interactive performance</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/future-phases-showcase-new-frontiers-music-technology-interactive-performance-0729</link>\n  <description>Groundbreaking MIT concert, featuring electronic and computer-generated music, was a part of the 2025 International Computer Music Conference.</description>\n  <pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 17:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/future-phases-showcase-new-frontiers-music-technology-interactive-performance-0729</guid>\n        <dc:creator>MIT Music and Theater Arts</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Music technology took center stage at MIT during “FUTURE PHASES,” an evening of works for string orchestra and electronics, presented by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://musictech.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program&lt;/a&gt; as part of the 2025 International Computer Music Conference (ICMC).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event was held last month in the Thomas Tull Concert Hall within the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building. Produced in collaboration with the MIT Media Lab’s Opera of the Future Group and Boston’s self-conducted chamber orchestra A Far Cry, “FUTURE PHASES” was the first event to be presented by the MIT Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program in MIT Music’s new space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“FUTURE PHASES” offerings included two new works by MIT composers: the world premiere of&amp;nbsp;“EV6,” by MIT Music’s Kenan Sahin Distinguished Professor Evan Ziporyn and professor of the practice Eran Egozy; and the U.S. premiere of&amp;nbsp;“FLOW Symphony,” by the MIT Media Lab’s Muriel R. Cooper Professor of Music and Media Tod Machover. Three additional works were selected by a jury from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://icmc2025.sites.northeastern.edu/special-call-for-scores-mit/\"&gt;an open call&lt;/a&gt; for works:&amp;nbsp;“The Wind Will Carry Us Away,” by Ali Balighi; “A Blank Page,” by Celeste Betancur&amp;nbsp;Gutiérrez and Luna Valentin; and “Coastal Portrait: Cycles and Thresholds,”&amp;nbsp;by Peter Lane. Each work was performed by&amp;nbsp;Boston’s own&amp;nbsp;multi-Grammy-nominated string orchestra, A Far Cry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ICMC is all about presenting the latest research, compositions, and performances in electronic music,” says Egozy,&amp;nbsp;director of the new Music Technology and Computation Graduate Program at MIT. When approached to be a part of this year’s conference, “it seemed the perfect opportunity to showcase MIT’s commitment&amp;nbsp;to music technology, and in particular the exciting new areas being developed right now: a new master’s program in music technology and computation, the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building with its enhanced music technology facilities, and new faculty arriving at MIT with joint appointments between &lt;a href=\"https://mta.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Music and Theater Arts&lt;/a&gt; (MTA) and the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).” These recently hired professors include Anna Huang, a keynote speaker for the conference and creator of the machine learning model&amp;nbsp;Coconet that powered Google’s first AI Doodle, the &lt;a href=\"https://magenta.tensorflow.org/coconet\"&gt;Bach Doodle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy emphasizes the uniqueness of this occasion: “You have to understand that this is a very special situation. Having a full 18-member string orchestra [A Far Cry] perform new works that include electronics does not happen very often. In most cases, ICMC performances consist either entirely of electronics and computer-generated music, or perhaps a small ensemble of two-to-four musicians. So the opportunity we could present to the larger community of music technology was particularly exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To take advantage of this exciting opportunity, an open call was put out internationally to select the other pieces that would accompany Ziporyn and Egozy’s “EV6” and Machover’s “FLOW Symphony.” Three pieces were selected from a total of 46 entries to be a part of the evening’s program by a panel of judges that included Egozy, Machover, and other distinguished composers and technologists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We received a huge variety of works from this call,” says Egozy. “We saw all kinds of musical styles and ways that electronics would be used. No two pieces were very similar to each other, and I think because of that, our audience got a sense of how varied and interesting a concert can be for this format. A Far Cry was really the unifying presence. They played all pieces with great passion and nuance. They have a way of really drawing audiences into the music. And, of course, with the Thomas Tull Concert Hall being in the round, the audience felt even more connected to the music.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy continues, “we took advantage of the technology built into the Thomas Tull Concert Hall, which has 24 built-in speakers for surround sound allowing us to broadcast unique, amplified sound to every seat in the house. Chances are that every person might have experienced the sound slightly differently, but there was always some sense of a multidimensional evolution of sound and music as the pieces unfolded.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five works of the evening employed a range of technological components that included playing synthesized, prerecorded, or electronically manipulated sounds; attaching microphones to instruments for use in real-time signal processing algorithms; broadcasting custom-generated musical notation to&amp;nbsp;the musicians; utilizing generative AI to process live sound and play it back in interesting and unpredictable ways; and audience participation, where spectators use their cellphones as musical instruments to become a part of the ensemble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ziporyn and Egozy’s piece, “EV6&lt;em&gt;,”&lt;/em&gt; took particular advantage of this last innovation: “Evan and I had previously collaborated on a system called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=\"https://musictech.mit.edu/tutti/\"&gt;Tutti&lt;/a&gt;, which means ‘together’ in Italian. Tutti gives an audience the ability to use their smartphones as musical instruments so that we can all play together.” Egozy developed the technology, which was first used in the MIT Campaign for a Better World in 2017. The original application involved a three-minute piece for cellphones only. “But for this concert,” Egozy explains, “Evan had the idea that we could use the same technology to write a new piece — this time, for audience phones and a live string orchestra as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explain the piece’s title, Ziporyn says, “I drive an EV6; it’s my first electric car, and when I first got it, it felt like I was driving an iPhone. But of course it’s still just a car: it’s got wheels and an engine, and it gets me from one place to another. It seemed like a good metaphor for this piece, in which a lot of the sound is literally played on cellphones, but still has to work like any other piece of music. It’s also a bit of an homage to David Bowie’s song ‘TVC 15,’ which is about falling in love with a robot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egozy adds, “We wanted audience members to feel what it is like to play together in an orchestra. Through this technology, each audience member becomes a part of an orchestral section (winds, brass, strings, etc.). As they play together, they can hear their whole section playing similar music while also hearing other sections in different parts of the hall play different music. This allows an audience to feel a responsibility to their section, hear how music can move between different sections of an orchestra, and experience the thrill of live performance. In ‘EV6,’ this experience was even more electrifying because everyone in the audience got to play with a live string orchestra — perhaps for the first time in recorded history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the concert, guests were treated to six music technology demonstrations that showcased the research of undergraduate and graduate students from both the MIT Music program and the MIT Media Lab. These included a gamified interface for harnessing just intonation systems (Antonis Christou); insights from a human-AI co-created concert (Lancelot Blanchard and Perry Naseck); a system for analyzing piano playing data across campus (Ayyub Abdulrezak ’24, MEng ’25); capturing music features from audio using latent frequency-masked autoencoders (Mason Wang); a device that turns any surface into a drum machine (Matthew Caren ’25); and a play-along interface for learning traditional Senegalese rhythms (Mariano Salcedo ’25). This last example led to the creation of Senegroove, a drumming-based application specifically designed for an upcoming edX online course taught by ethnomusicologist and MIT associate professor in music Patricia Tang, and world-renowned Senegalese drummer and MIT lecturer in music Lamine Touré, who provided performance videos of the foundational rhythms used in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Egozy muses, “'FUTURE PHASES' showed how having the right space — in this case, the new Edward and Joyce Linde Music Building — really can be a driving force for new ways of thinking, new projects, and new ways of collaborating. My hope is that everyone in the MIT community, the Boston area, and beyond soon discovers what a truly amazing place and space we have built, and are still building here, for music and music technology at MIT.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-MTA-6-13-25-335_0.jpg?itok=X_GvlV7G\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A Far Cry performs “EV6” as part of the “FUTURE PHASES” concert at MIT.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Photo: Jonathan Sachs</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/performances\">Performances</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music2\">Music</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/arts\">Arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music\">Music technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electronics\">Electronics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/media-lab-0\">Media Lab</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/music-and-theater-arts\">Music and theater arts</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-humanities-arts-and-social-sciences\">School of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Pedestrians now walk faster and linger less, researchers find</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/pedestrians-now-walk-faster-and-linger-less-researchers-find-0724</link>\n  <description>A computer vision study compares changes in pedestrian behavior since 1980, providing information for urban designers about creating public spaces.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:45:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/pedestrians-now-walk-faster-and-linger-less-researchers-find-0724</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Peter Dizikes | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;City life is often described as “fast-paced.” A new study suggests that’s more true than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, co-authored by MIT scholars, shows that the average walking speed of pedestrians in three northeastern U.S. cities increased 15 percent from 1980 to 2010. The number of people lingering in public spaces declined by 14 percent in that time as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used machine-learning tools to assess 1980s-era video footage captured by renowned urbanist William Whyte, in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They compared the old material with newer videos from the same locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something has changed over the past 40 years,” says MIT professor of the practice Carlo Ratti, a co-author of the new study. “How fast we walk, how people meet in public space — what we’re seeing here is that public spaces are working in somewhat different ways, more as a thoroughfare and less a space of encounter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2424662122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Exploring the social life of urban spaces through AI&lt;/a&gt;,” is published this week in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;. The co-authors are Arianna Salazar-Miranda MCP ’16, PhD ’23, an assistant professor at Yale University’s School of the Environment; Zhuanguan Fan of the University of Hong Kong; Michael Baick; Keith N. Hampton, a professor at Michigan State University; Fabio Duarte, associate director of the Senseable City Lab; Becky P.Y. Loo of the University of Hong Kong; Edward Glaeser,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Fred and Eleanor Glimp Professor of Economics at Harvard University; and Ratti, who is also director of MIT’s Senseable City Lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results could help inform urban planning, as designers seek to create new public areas or modify existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Public space is such an important element of civic life, and today partly because it counteracts the polarization of digital space,” says Salazar-Miranda. “The more we can keep improving public space, the more we can make our cities suited for convening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet you at the Met&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte was a prominent social thinker whose famous 1956 book, “The Organization Man,” probing the apparent culture of corporate conformity in the U.S., became a touchstone of its decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Whyte spent the latter decades of his career focused on urbanism. The footage he filmed, from 1978 through 1980, was archived by a Brooklyn-based nonprofit organization called the Project for Public Spaces and later digitized by Hampton and his students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whyte chose to make his recording at four spots in the three cities combined: Boston’s Downtown Crossing area; New York City’s Bryant Park; the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, a famous gathering point and people-watching spot; and Philadelphia’s Chestnut Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, a group led by Hampton then shot new footage at those locations, at the same times of day Whyte had, to compare and contrast current-day dynamics with those of Whyte’s time. To conduct the study, the co-authors used computer vision and AI models to summarize and quantify the activity in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have found that some things have not changed greatly. The percentage of people walking alone barely moved, from 67 percent in 1980 to 68 percent in 2010. On the other hand, the percentage of individuals entering these public spaces who became part of a group declined a bit. In 1980, 5.5 percent of the people approaching these spots met up with a group; in 2010, that was down to 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps there’s a more transactional nature to public space today,” Ratti says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer outdoor groups: Anomie or Starbucks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If people’s behavioral patterns have altered since 1980, it’s natural to ask why. Certainly some of the visible changes seem consistent with the pervasive use of cellphones; people organize their social lives by phone now, and perhaps zip around more quickly from place to place as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you look at the footage from William Whyte, the people in public spaces were looking at each other more,” Ratti says. “It was a place you could start a conversation or run into a friend. You couldn’t do things online then. Today, behavior is more predicated on texting first, to meet in public space.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the scholars note, if groups of people hang out together slightly less often in public spaces, there could be still another reason for that: Starbucks and its competitors. As the paper states, outdoor group socializing may be less common due to “the proliferation of coffee shops and other indoor venues. Instead of lingering on sidewalks, people may have moved their social interactions into air-conditioned, more comfortable private spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly coffeeshops were far less common in big cities in 1980, and the big chain coffeeshops did not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, public-space behavior might have been evolving all this time regardless of Starbucks and the like. The researchers say the new study offers a proof-of-concept for its method and has encouraged them to conduct additional work. Ratti, Duarte, and other researchers from MIT’s Senseable City Lab have turned their attention to an extensive survey of European public spaces in an attempt to shed more light on the interaction between people and the public forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are collecting footage from 40 squares in Europe,” Duarte says. “The question is: How can we learn at a larger scale? This is in part what we’re doing.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Urban-Walking-01.jpg?itok=YTbccwQn\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study finds that people walk faster and linger less in urban settings.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/urban-studies\">Urban studies and planning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cities\">Cities</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-vision\">Computer vision</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/technology-society\">Technology and society</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/social-media\">Social media</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-architecture-and-planning\">School of Architecture and Planning</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>New machine-learning application to help researchers predict chemical properties</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/chemxploreml-app-helps-predict-chemical-properties-0724</link>\n  <description>ChemXploreML makes advanced chemical predictions easier and faster — without requiring deep programming skills.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 24 Jul 2025 13:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/chemxploreml-app-helps-predict-chemical-properties-0724</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Danielle Randall Doughty | Department of Chemistry</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One of the shared, fundamental goals of most chemistry researchers is the need to predict a molecule’s properties, such as its boiling or melting point. Once researchers can pinpoint that prediction, they’re able to move forward with their work yielding discoveries that lead to medicines, materials, and more. Historically, however, the traditional methods of unveiling these predictions are associated with a significant cost — expending time and wear and tear on equipment, in addition to funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Enter a branch of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (ML). ML has lessened the burden of molecule property prediction to a degree, but the advanced tools that most effectively expedite the process — by learning from existing data to make rapid predictions for new molecules — require the user to have a significant level of programming expertise. This creates an accessibility barrier for many chemists, who may not have the significant computational proficiency required to navigate the prediction pipeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;To alleviate this challenge, researchers in the &lt;a href=\"https://mcguirelab.mit.edu/\"&gt;McGuire Research Group&lt;/a&gt; at MIT have created &lt;a href=\"https://aravindhnivas.github.io/ChemXploreML-docs/\"&gt;ChemXploreML&lt;/a&gt;, a user-friendly desktop app that helps chemists make these critical predictions without requiring advanced programming skills. Freely available, easy to download, and functional on mainstream platforms, this app is also built to operate entirely offline, which helps keep research data proprietary. The exciting new technology is outlined in an &lt;a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00516\"&gt;article published recently in&amp;nbsp;the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;One specific hurdle in chemical machine learning is translating molecular structures into a numerical language that computers can understand. ChemXploreML automates this complex process with powerful, built-in \"molecular embedders\" that transform chemical structures into informative numerical vectors. Next, the software implements state-of-the-art algorithms to identify patterns and accurately predict molecular properties like boiling and melting points, all through an intuitive, interactive graphical interface.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"The goal of ChemXploreML is to democratize the use of machine learning in the chemical sciences,” says&amp;nbsp;Aravindh Nivas Marimuthu, a postdoc in the McGuire Group and lead author of the article. “By creating an intuitive, powerful, and offline-capable desktop application, we are putting state-of-the-art predictive modeling directly into the hands of chemists, regardless of their programming background. This work not only accelerates the search for new drugs and materials by making the screening process faster and cheaper, but its flexible design also opens doors for future innovations.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;ChemXploreML is designed to to evolve over time, so as future techniques and algorithms are developed, they can be seamlessly integrated into the app, ensuring that researchers are always able to access and implement the most up-to-date methods. The application was tested on five key molecular properties of organic compounds — melting point, boiling point, vapor pressure, critical temperature, and critical pressure — and achieved high accuracy scores of up to 93 percent for the critical temperature. The researchers also demonstrated that a new, more compact method of representing molecules (VICGAE) was nearly as accurate as standard methods, such as Mol2Vec, but was up to 10 times faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“We envision a future where any researcher can easily customize and apply machine learning to solve unique challenges, from developing sustainable materials to exploring the complex chemistry of interstellar space,” says Marimuthu.

Even with today’s technology, if you wanted to make a fanciful picture of, say, a friend planting a flag on Mars or heedlessly flying into a black hole, it could take less than a second. However, before they can perform tasks like that, image generators are commonly trained on massive datasets containing millions of images that are often paired with associated text. Training these generative models can be an arduous chore that takes weeks or months, consuming vast computational resources in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if it were possible to generate images through AI methods without using a generator at all? That real possibility, along with other intriguing ideas, was described in a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08257\"&gt;research paper&lt;/a&gt; presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025), which was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, earlier this summer. The paper, describing novel techniques for manipulating and generating images, was written by Lukas Lao Beyer, a graduate student researcher in MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS); Tianhong Li, a postdoc at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL); Xinlei Chen of Facebook AI Research; Sertac Karaman, an MIT professor of aeronautics and astronautics and the director of LIDS; and Kaiming He, an MIT associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This group effort had its origins in a class project for a graduate seminar on deep generative models that Lao Beyer took last fall. In conversations during the semester, it became apparent to both Lao Beyer and He, who taught the seminar, that this research had real potential, which went far beyond the confines of a typical homework assignment. Other collaborators were soon brought into the endeavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting point for Lao Beyer’s inquiry was a June 2024 paper, written by researchers from the Technical University of Munich and the Chinese company ByteDance, which introduced a new way of representing visual information called a one-dimensional tokenizer. With this device, which is also a kind of neural network, a 256x256-pixel image can be translated into a sequence of just 32 numbers, called tokens. “I wanted to understand how such a high level of compression could be achieved, and what the tokens themselves actually represented,” says Lao Beyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The previous generation of tokenizers would typically break up the same image into an array of 16x16 tokens — with each token encapsulating information, in highly condensed form, that corresponds to a specific portion of the original image. The new 1D tokenizers can encode an image more efficiently, using far fewer tokens overall, and these tokens are able to capture information about the entire image, not just a single quadrant. Each of these tokens, moreover, is a 12-digit number consisting of 1s and 0s, allowing for 2&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; (or about 4,000) possibilities altogether. “It’s like a vocabulary of 4,000 words that makes up an abstract, hidden language spoken by the computer,” He explains. “It’s not like a human language, but we can still try to find out what it means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s exactly what Lao Beyer had initially set out to explore — work that provided the seed for the ICML 2025 paper. The approach he took was pretty straightforward. If you want to find out what a particular token does, Lao Beyer says, “you can just take it out, swap in some random value, and see if there is a recognizable change in the output.” Replacing one token, he found, changes the image quality, turning a low-resolution image into a high-resolution image or vice versa. Another token affected the blurriness in the background, while another still influenced the brightness. He also found a token that’s related to the “pose,” meaning that, in the image of a robin, for instance, the bird’s head might shift from right to left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was a never-before-seen result, as no one had observed visually identifiable changes from manipulating tokens,” Lao Beyer says. The finding raised the possibility of a new approach to editing images. And the MIT group has shown, in fact, how this process can be streamlined and automated, so that tokens don’t have to be modified by hand, one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He and his colleagues achieved an even more consequential result involving image generation. A system capable of generating images normally requires a tokenizer, which compresses and encodes visual data, along with a generator that can combine and arrange these compact representations in order to create novel images. The MIT researchers found a way to create images without using a generator at all. Their new approach makes use of a 1D tokenizer and a so-called detokenizer (also known as a decoder), which can reconstruct an image from a string of tokens. However, with guidance provided by an off-the-shelf neural network called CLIP —&amp;nbsp;which cannot generate images on its own, but can measure how well a given image matches a certain text prompt&amp;nbsp;— the team was able to convert an image of a red panda, for example, into a tiger. In addition, they could create images of a tiger, or any other desired form, starting completely from scratch — from a situation in which all the tokens are initially assigned random values (and then iteratively tweaked so that the reconstructed image increasingly matches the desired text prompt).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group demonstrated that with this same setup — relying on a tokenizer and detokenizer, but no generator — they could also do “inpainting,” which means filling in parts of images that had somehow been blotted out. Avoiding the use of a generator for certain tasks could lead to a significant reduction in computational costs because generators, as mentioned, normally require extensive training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What might seem odd about this team’s contributions, He explains, “is that we didn’t invent anything new. We didn’t invent a 1D tokenizer, and we didn’t invent the CLIP model, either. But we did discover that new capabilities can arise when you put all these pieces together.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work redefines the role of tokenizers,” comments&amp;nbsp;Saining Xie, a computer scientist at New York University. “It shows that&amp;nbsp;image tokenizers — tools usually used just to compress images — can actually do a lot more. The fact that a simple (but highly compressed) 1D tokenizer can handle tasks like inpainting or text-guided editing, without needing to train a full-blown generative model, is pretty surprising.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zhuang Liu of Princeton University agrees, saying that the work of the MIT group&amp;nbsp;“shows that we can generate and manipulate the images in a way that is much easier than we previously thought. Basically, it demonstrates that image generation can be a byproduct of a very effective image compressor, potentially reducing the cost of generating images several-fold.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could be many applications outside the field of computer vision, Karaman suggests. “For instance,&amp;nbsp;we could consider tokenizing the actions of robots or self-driving cars in the same way, which may rapidly broaden the impact of this work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lao Beyer is thinking along similar lines,&amp;nbsp;noting that the&amp;nbsp;extreme amount of compression afforded by 1D tokenizers allows you to do “some amazing things,” which could be applied to other fields. For example, in the area of self-driving cars, which is one of his research interests, the tokens could represent, instead of images, the different routes that a vehicle might take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xie is also intrigued by the applications that may come from these innovative ideas. “There are some really cool use cases this could unlock,” he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/mit-token-opt3.jpg?itok=A759koh8\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A system capable of generating images normally requires a tokenizer, which compresses and encodes visual data, along with a generator that can combine and arrange these compact representations in order to create novel images.

Fast forward 24 years: The Institute has now launched a dynamic AI-enabled website for its non-degree learning opportunities, making it easier for learners around the world to discover the courses and resources available on MIT’s various learning platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/\"&gt;MIT Learn&lt;/a&gt; enables learners to access more than 12,700 educational resources — including introductory and advanced courses, courseware, videos, podcasts, and more — from departments across the Institute. MIT Learn is designed to seamlessly connect the existing Institute’s learning platforms in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“With MIT Learn, we’re opening access to MIT’s digital learning opportunities for millions around the world,” says Dimitris Bertsimas, vice provost for open learning. “MIT Learn elevates learning with personalized recommendations powered by AI, guiding each learner toward deeper understanding. It is a stepping stone toward a broader vision of making these opportunities even more accessible to global learners through one unified learning platform.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The goal for MIT Learn is twofold: to allow learners to find what they want to fulfill their curiosity, and to enable learners to develop a long-term relationship with MIT as a source of educational experiences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“By fostering long-term connections between learners and MIT, we not only provide a pathway to continued learning, but also advance MIT’s mission to disseminate knowledge globally,” says Ferdi Alimadhi, chief technology officer for MIT Open Learning and the lead of the MIT Learn project. “With this initial launch of MIT Learn, we’re introducing AI-powered features that leverage emerging technologies to help learners discover the right content, engage with it more deeply, and stay supported as they shape their own educational journeys.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;With its sophisticated search, browse, and discovery capability, MIT Learn allows learners to explore topics without having to understand MIT’s organizational structure or know the names of departments and programs. An AI-powered recommendation feature called “Ask Tim” complements the site’s traditional search and browsing tools, helping learners quickly find courses and resources aligned with their personal and professional goals. Learners can also prompt “Ask Tim” for a summary of a course’s structure, topics, and expectations, leading to more-informed decisions before enrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;In select offerings, such as &lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/search?resource=16639\"&gt;Molecular Biology: DNA Replication and Repair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/search?resource=16799\"&gt;Genetics: The Fundamentals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://learn.mit.edu/search?resource=16794\"&gt;Cell Biology: Transport and Signaling&lt;/a&gt;, learners can interact with an AI assistant by asking questions about a lecture, requesting flashcards of key concepts, and obtaining instant summaries. These select offerings also feature an AI tutor to support learners as they work through problem sets, guiding them toward the next step without giving away the answers. These features, Alimadhi says, are being introduced in a limited set of courses and modules to allow the MIT Open Learning team to gather insights and improve the learning experience before expanding more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT Learn is a whole new front door to the Institute,” says Christopher Capozzola, senior associate dean for open learning, who worked with faculty across the Institute on the project. “Just as the Kendall Square renovations transformed the way that people interact with our physical campus, MIT Learn transforms how people engage with what we offer digitally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Learners who choose to create an account on MIT Learn receive personalized course recommendations and can create and curate lists of educational resources, follow their specific areas of interest, and receive notifications when new MIT content is available. They can also personalize their learning experience based on their specific interests and choose the format that is best suited to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;\"From anywhere and for anyone, MIT Learn makes lifelong learning more accessible and personalized, building on the Institute’s decades of global leadership in open learning,” says MIT Provost Anantha Chandrakasan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MIT Learn was designed to account for a learner’s evolving needs throughout their learning journey. It highlights supplemental study materials for middle schoolers, high schoolers, and college students, upskilling opportunities for early-career professionals, reskilling programs for those considering a career shift, and resources for educators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT has an amazing collection of learning opportunities, covering a wide range of formats,” says Eric Grimson, chancellor for academic advancement, who oversaw the initial development of MIT Learn during his time as interim vice president for open learning. “The sheer size of that collection can be daunting, so creating a platform that brings all of those offerings together, in an easily searchable framework, greatly enhances our ability to serve learners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;According to Peter Hirst, senior associate dean for executive education at MIT Sloan School of Management, one of the Institute's incredible strengths is its sheer volume and diversity of expertise, research, and learning opportunities. But it can be challenging to discover and follow all those opportunities — even for people who are immersed in the on-campus experience. MIT Learn, he says, is a solution to this problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT Learn gathers all the knowledge and learning resources offered across all of MIT into a learner-friendly, curatable repository that enables anyone and everyone, whatever their interests or learning needs,&amp;nbsp;to explore and engage in the wide range of learning resources and public certificate programs that MIT has to offer and that can help them achieve their goals,” Hirst says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;MIT Learn was spearheaded by MIT Open Learning, which aims to transform teaching and learning on and off the Institute’s campus. MIT Learn was developed with the direction of former provost Cynthia Barnhart, and in cooperation with MIT Sloan Executive Education and MIT Professional Education. During the design phase, OpenCourseWare Faculty Advisory Committee Chair Michael Short and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Faculty Advisory Committee Chair Caspar Hare contributed key insights, along with other numerous faculty involved with Open Learning’s product offerings, including OpenCourseWare,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;, and MicroMasters programs. MIT Learn is also informed by the insights of the Ad Hoc Committee on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“For over 20 years, MIT staff and faculty have been creating a wealth of online resources, from lecture videos to practice problems, and from single online courses to entire credential-earning programs,” says Sara Fisher Ellison, a member of the Ad Hoc Committee on&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; Online and the faculty lead for the online&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;MITx&lt;/em&gt; MicroMasters Program in Data, Economics, and Design of Policy. “Making these resources findable, searchable, and broadly available is a natural extension of MIT’s core educational mission. MIT Learn is a big, important step in that direction. We are excited for the world to see what we have to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Looking ahead, MIT Learn will also feature selected content from the MIT Press. As MIT Learn continues to grow, Open Learning is exploring collaborations with departments across the Institute with the goal of offering the fullest possible range of educational materials from MIT to learners around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“MIT Learn is the latest step in a long tradition of the Institute providing innovative ways for learners to access knowledge,” Barnhart says. “This AI-enabled platform delivers on the Institute’s commitment to help people launch into learning journeys that can unlock life-changing opportunities.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Learn_07212025_0.jpg?itok=n_sg0sxG\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">MIT Learn offers more than 12,700 educational resources — including introductory and advanced courses, courseware, videos, podcasts, and more — from departments across MIT. </media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image courtesy of MIT Open Learning.</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-sloan-school-management\">MIT Sloan School of Management</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mitx\">MITx</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-press\">MIT Press</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/office-open-learning\">Office of Open Learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/opencourseware\">OpenCourseWare</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/education\">Education, teaching, academics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/stem-education\">STEM education</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/k-12-education\">K-12 education</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/classes-and-programs\">Classes and programs</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/learning\">Learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/onlinelearning\">Online learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/open-access\">Open access</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/massive-open-online-courses-moocs\">Massive open online courses (MOOCs)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/human-computer-interaction\">Human-computer interaction</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/global\">Global</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-professional-education-0\">MIT Professional Education</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Model predicts long-term effects of nuclear waste on underground disposal systems</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/model-predicts-long-term-effects-nuclear-waste-underground-disposal-systems-0718</link>\n  <description>The simulations matched results from an underground lab experiment in Switzerland, suggesting modeling could be used to validate the safety of nuclear disposal sites.</description>\n  <pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/model-predicts-long-term-effects-nuclear-waste-underground-disposal-systems-0718</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Zach Winn | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As countries across the world experience a resurgence in nuclear energy projects, the questions of where and how to dispose of nuclear waste remain as politically fraught as ever. The United States, for instance, has indefinitely stalled its only long-term underground nuclear waste repository. Scientists are using both modeling and experimental methods to study the effects of underground nuclear waste disposal and ultimately, they hope, build public trust in the decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from scientists at MIT, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and the University of Orléans makes progress in that direction. The study shows that simulations of underground nuclear waste interactions, generated by new, high-performance-computing software, aligned well with experimental results from a research facility in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was co-authored by MIT PhD student Dauren Sarsenbayev and Assistant Professor Haruko Wainwright, along with&amp;nbsp;Christophe Tournassat and&amp;nbsp;Carl Steefel, &lt;a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2511885122\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These powerful new computational tools, coupled with real-world experiments like those at the Mont Terri research site in Switzerland, help us understand how radionuclides will migrate in coupled underground systems,” says Sarsenbayev, who is first author of the new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors hope the research will improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research — coupling both computation and experiments — is important to improve our confidence in waste disposal safety assessments,” says Wainwright. “With nuclear energy re-emerging as a key source for tackling climate change and ensuring energy security, it is critical to validate disposal pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparing simulations with experiments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disposing of nuclear waste in deep underground geological formations is currently considered the safest long-term solution for managing high-level radioactive waste. As such, much effort has been put into studying the migration behaviors of radionuclides from nuclear waste within various natural and engineered geological materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its founding in 1996, the Mont Terri research site in northern Switzerland has served as an important test bed for an international consortium of researchers interested in studying materials like Opalinus clay — a thick, water-tight claystone abundant in the tunneled areas of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is widely regarded as one of the most valuable real-world experiment sites because it provides us with decades of datasets around the interactions of cement and clay, and those are the key materials proposed to be used by countries across the world for engineered barrier systems and geological repositories for nuclear waste,” explains Sarsenbayev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For their study, Sarsenbayev and Wainwright collaborated with co-authors Tournassat and Steefel, who have developed high-performance computing software to improve modeling of interactions between the nuclear waste and both engineered and natural materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To date, several challenges have limited scientists’ understanding of how nuclear waste reacts with cement-clay barriers. For one thing, the barriers are made up of irregularly mixed materials deep underground. Additionally, the existing class of models commonly used to simulate radionuclide interactions with cement-clay do not take into account electrostatic effects associated with the negatively charged clay minerals in the barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tournassat and Steefel’s new software accounts for electrostatic effects, making it the only one that can simulate those interactions in three-dimensional space. The software, called CrunchODiTi, was developed from established software known as CrunchFlow and was most recently updated this year. It is designed to be run on many high-performance computers at once in parallel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, the researchers looked at a 13-year-old experiment, with an initial focus on cement-clay rock interactions. Within the last several years, a mix of both negatively and positively charged ions were added to the borehole located near the center of the cement emplaced in the formation. The researchers focused on a 1-centimeter-thick zone between the radionuclides and cement-clay referred to as the “skin.” They compared their experimental results to the software simulation, finding the two datasets aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The results are quite significant because previously, these models wouldn’t fit field data very well,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s interesting how fine-scale phenomena at the ‘skin’ between cement and clay, the physical and chemical properties of which changes over time, could be used to reconcile the experimental and simulation data.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experimental results showed the model successfully accounted for electrostatic effects associated with the clay-rich formation and the interaction between materials in Mont Terri over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is all driven by decades of work to understand what happens at these interfaces,” Sarsenbayev says. “It’s been hypothesized that there is mineral precipitation and porosity clogging at this interface, and our results strongly suggest that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This application requires millions of degrees of freedom because these multibarrier systems require high resolution and a lot of computational power,” Sarsenbayev says. “This software is really ideal for the Mont Terri experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assessing waste disposal plans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model could now replace older models that have been used to conduct safety and performance assessments of underground geological repositories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If the U.S. eventually decides to dispose nuclear waste in a geological repository, then these models could dictate the most appropriate materials to use,” Sarsenbayev says. “For instance, right now clay is considered an appropriate storage material, but salt formations are another potential medium that could be used. These models allow us to see the fate of radionuclides over millennia. We can use them to understand interactions at timespans that vary from months to years to many millions of years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarsenbayev says the model is reasonably accessible to other researchers and that future efforts may focus on the use of machine learning to develop less computationally expensive surrogate models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further data from the experiment will be available later this month. The team plans to compare those data to additional simulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our collaborators will basically get this block of cement and clay, and they’ll be able to run experiments to determine the exact thickness of the skin along with all of the minerals and processes present at this interface,”&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Sarsenbayev says. “It’s a huge project and it takes time, but we wanted to share initial data and this software as soon as we could.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the researchers hope their study leads to a long-term solution for storing nuclear waste that policymakers and the public can support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is an interdisciplinary study that includes real world experiments showing we’re able to predict radionuclides’ fate in the subsurface,” Sarsenbayev says. “The motto of MIT’s Department of Nuclear Science and Engineering is ‘Science. Systems. Society.’ I think this merges all three domains.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-Waste-Storage-01.jpg?itok=lR_HzoIX\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new study, co-authored by MIT researchers, aims to improve confidence among policymakers and the public in the long-term safety of underground nuclear waste disposal.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-engineering\">Nuclear science and engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-power-and-reactors\">Nuclear power and reactors</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nuclear-security-and-policy\">Nuclear security and policy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/energy\">Energy</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computer-modeling\">Computer modeling</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>This “smart coach” helps LLMs switch between text and code</title>\n  <link>https://news.mit.edu/2025/smart-coach-helps-llms-switch-between-text-and-code-0717</link>\n  <description>The CodeSteer system could boost large language models’ accuracy when solving complex problems, such as scheduling shipments in a supply chain.</description>\n  <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate>\n    <guid isPermaLink=\"true\">https://news.mit.edu/2025/smart-coach-helps-llms-switch-between-text-and-code-0717</guid>\n        <dc:creator>Adam Zewe | MIT News</dc:creator>\n  <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLMs) excel at using textual reasoning to understand the context of a document and provide a logical answer about its contents. But these same LLMs often struggle to correctly answer even the simplest math problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Textual reasoning is usually a less-than-ideal way to deliberate over computational or algorithmic tasks. While some LLMs can generate code like Python to handle symbolic queries, the models don’t always know when to use code, or what kind of code would work best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLMs, it seems, may need a coach to steer them toward the best technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/yongchao98/CodeSteer-v1.0\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;CodeSteer&lt;/a&gt;, a smart assistant developed by MIT researchers that guides an LLM to switch between code and text generation until it correctly answers a query.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CodeSteer, itself a smaller LLM, automatically generates a series of prompts to iteratively steer a larger LLM. It reviews the model’s current and previous answers after each round and provides guidance for how it can fix or refine that solution until it deems the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that augmenting a larger LLM with CodeSteer boosted its accuracy on symbolic tasks, like multiplying numbers, playing Sudoku, and stacking blocks, by more than 30 percent. It also enabled less sophisticated models to outperform more advanced models with enhanced reasoning skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This advance could improve the problem-solving capabilities of LLMs for complex tasks that are especially difficult to solve with textual reasoning alone, such as generating paths for robots in uncertain environments or scheduling shipments in an international supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a race to develop better and better models that are capable of doing everything, but we’ve taken a complementary approach. Researchers have spent years developing effective technologies and tools to tackle problems in many domains. We want to enable LLMs to select the right tools and methods, and make use of others’ expertise to enhance their own capabilities,” says Chuchu Fan, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics (AeroAstro) and principal investigator in the MIT Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fan, the senior author of the study, is joined on &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04350\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;a paper about the work&lt;/a&gt; by LIDS graduate student Yongchao Chen; AeroAstro graduate student Yilun Hao; University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign graduate student Yueying Liu; and MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab Research Scientist Yang Zhang. The research will be presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An LLM “trainer”&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask an LLM which number is bigger, 9.11 or 9.9, and it will often give the wrong answer by using textual reasoning. But ask it to use code to answer the same question, and it can generate and execute a Python script to compare the two numbers, easily solving the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially trained to understand and predict human language, LLMs are more likely to answer queries using text, even when code would be more effective. And while they have learned to generate code through fine-tuning, these models often generate an incorrect or less efficient version of the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than trying to retrain a powerful LLM like GPT-4 or Claude to improve these capabilities, the MIT researchers fine-tune a smaller, lightweight LLM to guide a larger model between text and code. Fine-tuning a smaller model doesn’t change the larger LLM, so there is no risk it would undermine the larger model’s other abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were also inspired by humans. In sports, a trainer may not be better than the star athlete on the team, but the trainer can still give helpful suggestions to guide the athlete. This steering method works for LLMs, too,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trainer, CodeSteer, works in conjunction with the larger LLM. It first reviews a query and determines whether text or code is suitable for this problem, and which sort of code would be best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it generates a prompt for the larger LLM, telling it to use a coding method or textual reasoning to answer the query. The larger model follows this prompt to answer the query and sends the result back to CodeSteer, which reviews it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is not correct, CodeSteer will continue prompting the LLM to try different things that might fix the problem, such as incorporating a search algorithm or constraint into its Python code, until the answer is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that oftentimes, the larger LLM will try to be lazy and use a shorter, less efficient code that will not carry the correct symbolic calculation. We’ve designed CodeSteer to avoid this phenomenon,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A symbolic checker evaluates the code’s complexity and sends a signal to CodeSteer if it is too simple or inefficient. The researchers also incorporate a self-answer checker into CodeSteer, which prompts the LLM to generate code that calculates the answer to verify it is correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tackling complex tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers designed CodeSteer, they couldn’t find suitable symbolic datasets to fine-tune and test the model, since many existing benchmarks don’t point out whether a certain query could be best solved with text or code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, they gathered a corpus of 37 complex symbolic tasks, including spatial reasoning, mathematics, order reasoning, and optimization, and built their own dataset, called SymBench. They implemented a fine-tuning approach that leverages SymBench to maximize the performance of CodeSteer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their experiments, CodeSteer outperformed all nine baseline methods they evaluated and boosted average accuracy from 53.3 percent to 86.4 percent. It maintains similar performance even on unseen tasks, and on a variety of LLMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a general-purpose model augmented with CodeSteer can achieve higher accuracy than state-of-the-art models designed to focus on complex reasoning and planning, while requiring much less computation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our method uses an LLM’s own capabilities. By augmenting an LLM with the ability to smartly use coding, we can take a model that is already very strong and improve its performance even more,” Chen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to streamline CodeSteer to speed up its iterative prompting process. In addition, they are studying how to effectively fine-tune a unified model with the ability to switch between textual reasoning and code generation, rather than relying on a separate assistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The authors present an elegant solution to the critical challenge of tool utilization in LLMs. This simple yet impactful method enables state-of-the-art LLMs to achieve significant performance improvements without requiring direct fine-tuning,” says Jinsung Yoon, a staff research scientist at Google Cloud AI, who was not involved with this work. “This research represents a substantial contribution that promises to significantly enhance the application of LLMs to a diverse range of tasks with which they currently struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Their success in training a smaller, specialized model to strategically guide larger, advanced models is particularly impactful,” adds Chi Wang, a senior staff scientist at Google DeepMind who was not involved with this work. “This intelligent collaboration among diverse AI ‘agents’ paves the way for more robust and versatile applications in complex real-world scenarios.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is supported, in part, by the U.S. Office of Naval Research and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT_Symbolic-LLMs-01.jpg?itok=ATMqgM63\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">CodeSteer is a smart assistant developed by MIT researchers that guides an LLM to switch between code and text generation until it correctly answers a query.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Credit: Christine Daniloff, MIT; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/machine-learning\">Machine learning</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mathematics\">Mathematics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-ibm-watson-ai-lab\">MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab</category>\n    </item>\n<item>\n  <title>Can AI really code?

Recent advances appear to have nudged that future tantalizingly close, but a new paper by researchers at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and several collaborating institutions argues that this potential future reality demands a hard look at present-day challenges.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Titled “&lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22625\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;Challenges and Paths Towards AI for Software Engineering&lt;/a&gt;,” the work maps the many software-engineering tasks beyond code generation, identifies current bottlenecks, and highlights research directions to overcome them, aiming to let humans focus on high-level design while routine work is automated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Everyone is talking about how we don’t need programmers anymore, and there’s all this automation now available,” says Armando Solar‑Lezama, MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science, CSAIL principal investigator, and senior author of the study. “On the one hand, the field has made tremendous progress. We have tools that are way more powerful than any we’ve seen before. But there’s also a long way to go toward really getting the full promise of automation that we would expect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Solar-Lezama argues that popular narratives often shrink software engineering to “the undergrad programming part: someone hands you a spec for a little function and you implement it, or solving LeetCode-style programming interviews.” Real practice is far broader. It includes everyday refactors that polish design, plus sweeping migrations that move millions of lines from COBOL to Java and reshape entire businesses. It requires nonstop testing and analysis — fuzzing, property-based testing, and other methods — to catch concurrency bugs, or patch zero-day flaws. And it involves the maintenance grind: documenting decade-old code, summarizing change histories for new teammates, and reviewing pull requests for style, performance, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Industry-scale code optimization — think re-tuning GPU kernels or the relentless, multi-layered refinements behind Chrome’s V8 engine — remains stubbornly hard to evaluate. Today’s headline metrics were designed for short, self-contained problems, and while multiple-choice tests still dominate natural-language research, they were never the norm in AI-for-code. The field’s de facto yardstick, SWE-Bench, simply asks a model to patch a GitHub issue: useful, but still akin to the “undergrad programming exercise” paradigm. It touches only a few hundred lines of code, risks data leakage from public repositories, and ignores other real-world contexts — AI-assisted refactors, human–AI pair programming, or performance-critical rewrites that span millions of lines. Until benchmarks expand to capture those higher-stakes scenarios, measuring progress — and thus accelerating it — will remain an open challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;If measurement is one obstacle, human‑machine communication is another. First author Alex  Gu, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science, sees today’s interaction as “a thin line of communication.” When he asks a system to generate code, he often receives a large, unstructured file and even a set of unit tests, yet those tests tend to be superficial. This gap extends to the AI’s ability to effectively use the wider suite of software engineering tools, from debuggers to static analyzers, that humans rely on for precise control and deeper understanding. “I don’t really have much control over what the model writes,” he says. “Without a channel for the AI to expose its own confidence — ‘this part’s correct … this part, maybe double‑check’ — developers risk blindly trusting hallucinated logic that compiles, but collapses in production. Another critical aspect is having the AI know when to defer to the user for clarification.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Scale compounds these difficulties. Current AI models struggle profoundly with large code bases, often spanning millions of lines. Foundation models learn from public GitHub, but “every company’s code base is kind of different and unique,” Gu says, making proprietary coding conventions and specification requirements fundamentally out of distribution. The result is code that looks plausible yet calls non‑existent functions, violates internal style rules, or fails continuous‑integration pipelines. This often leads to AI-generated code that “hallucinates,” meaning it creates content that looks plausible but doesn’t align with the specific internal conventions, helper functions, or architectural patterns of a given company.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Models will also often retrieve incorrectly, because it retrieves code with a similar name (syntax) rather than functionality and logic, which is what a model might need to know how to write the function. “Standard retrieval techniques are very easily fooled by pieces of code that are doing the same thing but look different,” says Solar‑Lezama.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;The authors mention that since there is no silver bullet to these issues, they’re calling instead for community‑scale efforts: richer, having data that captures the process of developers writing code (for example, which code developers keep versus throw away, how code gets refactored over time, etc.), shared evaluation suites that measure progress on refactor quality, bug‑fix longevity, and migration correctness; and transparent tooling that lets models expose uncertainty and invite human steering rather than passive acceptance. Gu frames the agenda as a “call to action” for larger open‑source collaborations that no single lab could muster alone. Solar‑Lezama imagines incremental advances—“research results taking bites out of each one of these challenges separately”—that feed back into commercial tools and gradually move AI from autocomplete sidekick toward genuine engineering partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“Why does any of this matter? Software already underpins finance, transportation, health care, and the minutiae of daily life, and the human effort required to build and maintain it safely is becoming a bottleneck. An AI that can shoulder the grunt work — and do so without introducing hidden failures — would free developers to focus on creativity, strategy, and ethics” says Gu. “But that future depends on acknowledging that code completion is the easy part; the hard part is everything else. Our goal isn’t to replace programmers. It’s to amplify them. When AI can tackle the tedious and the terrifying, human engineers can finally spend their time on what only humans can do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;“With so many new works emerging in AI for coding, and the community often chasing the latest trends, it can be hard to step back and reflect on which problems are most important to tackle,” says Baptiste Rozière, an AI scientist at Mistral AI, who wasn’t involved in the paper. “I enjoyed reading this paper because it offers a clear overview of the key tasks and challenges in AI for software engineering. It also outlines promising directions for future research in the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Gu and Solar-Lezama wrote the paper with University of California at Berkeley Professor Koushik Sen and PhD students Naman Jain and Manish Shetty, Cornell University Assistant Professor Kevin Ellis and PhD student Wen-Ding Li, Stanford University Assistant Professor Diyi Yang and PhD student Yijia Shao, and incoming Johns Hopkins University assistant professor Ziyang Li.

Their approach allows scientists to efficiently estimate how combinations of treatments will affect a group of units, such as cells, enabling a researcher to perform fewer costly experiments while gathering more accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, to study how interconnected genes affect cancer cell growth, a biologist might need to use a combination of treatments to target multiple genes at once. But because there could be billions of potential combinations for each round of the experiment, choosing a subset of combinations to test might bias the data their experiment generates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the new framework considers the scenario where the user can efficiently design an unbiased experiment by assigning all treatments in parallel, and can control the outcome by adjusting the rate of each treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers theoretically proved a near-optimal strategy in this framework and performed a series of simulations to test it in a multiround experiment. Their method minimized the error rate in each instance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique could someday help scientists better understand disease mechanisms and develop new medicines to treat cancer or genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve introduced a concept people can think more about as they study the optimal way to select combinatorial treatments at each round of an experiment. Our hope is this can someday be used to solve biologically relevant questions,” says graduate student Jiaqi Zhang, an Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center Fellow and co-lead author of a &lt;a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.03363\" target=\"_blank\"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; on this experimental design framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is joined on the paper by co-lead author Divya Shyamal, an MIT undergraduate; and senior author Caroline Uhler, the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Professor of Engineering in EECS and the MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), who is also director of the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center and a researcher at MIT’s Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS). The research was recently presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simultaneous treatments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treatments can interact with each other in complex ways. For instance, a scientist trying to determine whether a certain gene contributes to a particular disease symptom may have to target several genes simultaneously to study the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, scientists use what are known as combinatorial perturbations, where they apply multiple treatments at once to the same group of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Combinatorial perturbations will give you a high-level network of how different genes interact, which provides an understanding of how a cell functions,” Zhang explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since genetic experiments are costly and time-consuming, the scientist aims to select the best subset of treatment combinations to test, which is a steep challenge due to the huge number of possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking a suboptimal subset can generate biased results by focusing only on combinations the user selected in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT researchers approached this problem differently by looking at a probabilistic framework. Instead of focusing on a selected subset, each unit randomly takes up combinations of treatments based on user-specified dosage levels for each treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user sets dosage levels based on the goal of their experiment — perhaps this scientist wants to study the effects of four different drugs on cell growth. The probabilistic approach generates less biased data because it does not restrict the experiment to a predetermined subset of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dosage levels are like probabilities, and each cell receives a random combination of treatments. If the user sets a high dosage, it is more likely most of the cells will take up that treatment. A smaller subset of cells will take up that treatment if the dosage is low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“From there, the question is how do we design the dosages so that we can estimate the outcomes as accurately as possible? This is where our theory comes in,” Shyamal adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their theoretical framework shows the best way to design these dosages so one can learn the most about the characteristic or trait they are studying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After each round of the experiment, the user collects the results and feeds those back into the experimental framework. It will output the ideal dosage strategy for the next round, and so on, actively adapting the strategy over multiple rounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimizing dosages, minimizing error&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers proved their theoretical approach generates optimal dosages, even when the dosage levels are affected by a limited supply of treatments or when noise in the experimental outcomes varies at each round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simulations, this new approach had the lowest error rate when comparing estimated and actual outcomes of multiround experiments, outperforming two baseline methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, the researchers want to enhance their experimental framework to consider interference between units and the fact that certain treatments can lead to selection bias. They would also like to apply this technique in a real experimental setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a new approach to a very interesting problem that is hard to solve. Now, with this new framework in hand, we can think more about the best way to design experiments for many different applications,” Zhang says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is funded, in part, by the Advanced Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program at MIT, Apple, the National Institutes of Health, the Office of Naval Research, the Department of Energy, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Center at the Broad Institute, and a Simons Investigator Award.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>\n      <media:content url=\"https://news.mit.edu/sites/default/files/styles/news_article__cover_image__original/public/images/202507/MIT-Combinatoral-Interventions-01-press.jpg?itok=HNOFnzAd\" medium=\"image\" type=\"image/jpeg\" width=\"390\" height=\"260\">\n              <media:description type=\"plain\">A new experimental design framework could enable scientists to efficiently estimate how combinations of interventions will affect a group of cells, reducing the cost of experiments and providing less biased data that could be used to understand disease mechanisms or develop new treatments.</media:description>\n              <media:credit>Image: MIT News; iStock</media:credit>\n      </media:content>\n        <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/research\">Research</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biological-engineering\">Biological engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/cells\">Cells</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/biology\">Biology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/diagnostics\">Diagnostics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/health2\">Health</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/disease\">Disease</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/medicine\">Medicine</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/pharmaceuticals\">Pharmaceuticals</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/genetics\">Genetics</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/artificial-intelligence2\">Artificial intelligence</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/algorithms\">Algorithms</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/computers\">Computer science and technology</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/lids\">Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/idss\">IDSS</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/electrical-engineering-computer-science-eecs\">Electrical engineering and computer science (EECS)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/school-engineering\">School of Engineering</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/mit-schwarzman-college-computing\">MIT Schwarzman College of Computing</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/broad-institute\">Broad Institute</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/nih\">National Institutes of Health (NIH)</category>\n      <category domain=\"https://news.mit.edu/topic/doe\">Department of Energy (DoE)</category>\n    </item>\n\n  </channel>\n</rss>\n"
